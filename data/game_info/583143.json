Because they <strong>don't</strong>.  You  keep waking up in different, weird open worlds. You have no choice but  to explore them, trying to survive and to get back to reality as soon as  possible. <br/></p>\n<p>Suddenly you'll find yourself in magic medieval-like  towns, fighting against fire-spitting dragons with a magic sword, then  you'll find handguns and rifles to attack fierce giant creatures that  come right at you.        You keep waking up in mysterious, unexplored places.  You're in a <strong>loop</strong>. You keep living the same moment again and again.  It's up to you to decide how you're going to live it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What you'll find in this game: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>  Giant open worlds; </li><li>Creatures that try to kill you; </li><li>A psychotic narration; </li><li>Magic swords; </li><li>More creatures that try to kill you; </li><li>Things that blow up for no reason;</li><li>Even UFOs! Maybe. I'm not supposed to talk about it.</li></ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that L.S.D. is being developed by a solo, but very possionate, indie developer! That's me!    L.S.D.  is my very first commercial game. I love creating games that feature  open worlds and that let me channel my creativity in unusual ways.  That's how I came up with the idea for L.S.D. <br/></p>\n<p>If you'd like to get notified about the complete game (and sales) at launch, make sure to put it in your wishlist!  Wishlisting L.S.D. is a great way to support me in creating the game of my dreams in a completely free way.    Feel free to contact me for feedback, advice and anything related to the project.</p>\n<p>Steam | Instagram | Discord | Press Kit<br/></p>\n<p>Wishlist the complete game on Steam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T15:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5be4dd99a6f58d435622eb21fd23a1aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Salvatore Fabio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
