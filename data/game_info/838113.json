There will most likely be no more work done on this game.</p>\n<p><strong>STORY:</strong></p>\n<p>In a post-apocalyptic world, artificially intelligent robotic detectives bring dogs with them to literally sniff out clues... and you are one of them.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W and S to switch between buttons on the title screen</li></ul>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Z to sniff</li></ul>\n<ul><li>E to select and interact with clues and the detective</li></ul>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Sniffing will point towards the nearest clue, but only directly\u00a0up, down, left, or right. When standing on the clue,\u00a0 press E to pick it up. Only 1\u00a0clue can be carried at\u00a0a time and must be delivered to the detective\u00a0before finding another. If a clue is carried while\u00a0sniffing, the sniff will be pointed in the direction of the detective instead of the nearest clue.\u00a0 Each round has a 60-second time limit. If the timer reaches 0, the game ends. The level selected is randomized when the play button is pressed, as well as the number of clues and\u00a0where they\u00a0are in the level.\u00a0Find all clues and bring them to the detective to win.</p>\n<p><strong>CREATION:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made with GameMaker\u00a0Studio 2. My ideas for the project were compiled into a list and put into a random number generator to choose the game (kinda like the dinkiest form of AI). The character design for the detective\u00a0was decided by Dall-E Mini and interpreted into pixel art using Aseprite.\u00a0 The original concept of the game had the detective wandering around and doing things in the levels however I\u00a0ran out of time to implement it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c98/c98beb8158f96bc5d41205ce244d9b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fizzly Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
