The first to have a completely red health bar loses. But be aware, that a Tank isn't stationary! Move around to make your opponent sweat, when he has to adjust his shooting angle as well as his power!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use A and D to Move as long as you have a Fuel in your orange bar.</p>\n<p>Use the left and right Arrow keys to adjust the angle.</p>\n<p>-&gt; The angle influences the range immense, it reaches from about 45 degrees(0) to 67.25 degrees(100)</p>\n<p>Use the up and down Arrow keys to adjust the strength.</p>\n<p>-&gt; The strength is for slight adjustments after you adjusted your angle.
