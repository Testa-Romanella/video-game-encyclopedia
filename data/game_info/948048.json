A split of second to lift up your eyes and make a decision, splashes of ice into your face, feeling of flight and a great speed... Here it is - welcome! First person mode gives you a full sense of presense, realistic physical puck and only a short moment to escape the colision! You can invite friends, build a team and play online, or try your luck and play alone offline with an AI partner against exstra smart AI guys. <br/>\r\nHot Ice was conceived and developed as an alternative to regular classic hockey simulators - presenting you a feeling and comfort of a spectator. You will find nothing of this kind in Hot Ice!) It's overhelmingly swift, tough and live. You control your player and drive the puck with a mouse - giving it the desired velociy and direction - lift it or let it go low, pass it to your partner or shoot. <br/>\r\nYou can push, escape collisions by jumping or catch and tumble someone trying to push you.<br/>\r\nWe hope you will enjoy our game and have a real fun and a nice time with friends.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T04:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02d4c5de220dcaaf3dc9e92213f4e762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doctormouse"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["doctormouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
