I was inspired by the Unity Halloween Asset Store sale and remembering how cool it was to watch Jason Weimann make a fun Halloween game the other year. I have always wanted to try that. So here is my Game made in approximately 5 business days. Hope you all enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are nice and easy. You click on the screen to launch your fireworks to blow up the falling Jack-O-Lanterns. If the kids have placed the rockets one will fire to blow up them up.\u00a0 The game ends when you lose all your kids.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T04:34:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/962/9626ac823d388d3e13a6934f5ed4043a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mbalrog6"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
