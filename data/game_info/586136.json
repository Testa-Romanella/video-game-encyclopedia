Transport reacts to surface irregularities.<br/>\r\nSomewhere you have to drive carefully, but somewhere on the contrary, accelerate in order to jump over a hole or an obstacle.<br/>\r\nThere are several types of transport at your disposal, for example, a motorcycle is more maneuverable and faster than a conventional car.<br/>\r\nMonster Trucks are better at overcoming irregularities on the surface.<br/>\r\nDo not forget that during the flight you can change the slope of the vehicle. This will prevent you from rolling over upon landing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:18:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bc17fd63d6aa37d6ad499a7a803ca7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kovalevviktor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["kovalevviktor"], "esrb_rating": null}
