{"id": 446550, "slug": "bound-arms", "name": "Bound Arms", "name_original": "Bound Arms", "description": "<p>An abandoned RPG project from 2015 that I thought I had lost but dug up today (May 2020). I've decided to post it publically since I know I'm not returning to it. It was inspired by wanting to make a battle system like <em>Dragon Quest</em> (1987) but \"more interesting\" as I could conceive of it in 2015.</p>\n<p>Summary of the game itself:</p>\n<p>Play as Muirren, a knight whose arm has been cursed to become a sword of great power. She travels to a small village where she has heard rumors that the magic lying within the ominous tower looming nearby would be able to rid her of this wicked sorcery.</p>\n<p>-Very small town to walk around and rest at the inn</p>\n<p>-One floor of a tower to explore</p>\n<p>-Battles against several different kinds of enemies with varying tactics; dispatch them with the several manuevers you have at your disposal</p>\n<p>-Gain EXP and Gold to level up and rest at the inn</p>\n\n<p>As this project is abandoned, it is lacking many things, namely: NPCs other than the innkeeper, a boss fight, a proper inventory management system, and an ending. You simply walk around the dungeon and level up and that's about it.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:57:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c64e129ec0c6298e82aa201aeef7ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrSlouch"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
