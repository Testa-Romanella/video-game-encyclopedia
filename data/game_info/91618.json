I don\u2019t have many pieces so you\u2019ll have to play with just one for now. Also I don\u2019t have many chess boards so you\u2019ll have to share the same chess board as everyone else. It can get a little cramped, we\u2019re kind of running out of space, sorry!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click a square to move</li><li>Take as many chess pieces as you can</li><li>When you die you respawn so that\u2019s fine</li><li>There are AI enemy chess pieces, as well as real humans playing at the same time. And one board for all of you.</li></ul>\n<p>How to distinguish AI players for human players? Well\u2026 the humans are probably a lot better. You might need to message a friend and get them to play at the same time to actually see that happen though.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>It can kind of lag a little bit</li><li>Sometimes doesn't register clicks properly :(</li></ul><p>If you just see a grey screen and music, if means the game couldn't connect to the server. Make sure you have an internet connection and try restarting it!</p><p>Windows and Linux builds totally untested</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac4862e787e19b2bbacc1a0969b2e93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jez Swanson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
