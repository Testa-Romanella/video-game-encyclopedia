Has difficulty levels based on how close the demons can spawn to you, how fast they can move, and how many can spawn at once. Final boss battle will spawn many at once in a final push by the demons to kill you once and for all. Very simple and straight forward game coded entirely by me and re-using free assets on the Unity Asset store for a college project to showcase several different coding techniques and methods. Only in-game asset made entirely by me is the particle effects seen on the skulls.\u00a0 Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Low-Poly Skull by: Ervis Lilaj</p>\n<p>TurretA by: Ogasoda</p>\n<p>Cracked stone filled with lava by: MikeLarg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d3bc3930dfcd5dd9fcdd4547430d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JimmyDoh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
