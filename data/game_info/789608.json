And you're going to help!</p>\n<p>Move with A and D or the arrows. You can jump with W or space and perform a tongue grab with S or enter.<br/></p>\r\nGame Jam\r\n<p>We made this for the 106th Mini Jam. It's our first try making a jam game, so thanks in advance for playing, and we always appreciate feedback! :)</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was frogs, and the limitation was a time limit. So our main character is a frog, and he has a hunger timer constantly counting down. He can buy himself more time by eating his enemies, but it's only a few seconds of extra life... Eventually you must perish. Or eat the moon. Your choice.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This jam is our first time making a whole game from scratch! We developed all the graphics, code, and sounds ourselves except the following:\r\n</p>\n<p>The main tileset is a palette swap and partial redesign of one by Kenney.nl on opengameart.org.</p>\n<p>The title font is Panipuri by Khurasan, and the main text is Rainy Hearts by Camellina. Not sure about that name though - anyone can see they're flies!</p>\n<p>The game is written in Godot, with graphics drawn in Photoshop and Aseprite, sound effects recorded in Audacity, and music composed in MuseScore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T23:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/635dcc29a25ee394cd46a7a5946c73e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AllieKatStudio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
