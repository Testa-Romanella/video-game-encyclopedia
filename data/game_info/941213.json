Now when you start playing there are two options: normal game, SPEEN(vinesauce reference) and local multiplayer. In the normal game is the main plot. Im gonna explain it in the end of the description. Second is SPEEN in witch was the first thing I made(a script for a rolling ball made Mario and Luigi spin and the idea came). Okey here is the plot: In here Mario and Luigi are invited to the castle for a cake\u00a0,but the second Mario sets foot in the castle, he is thrown out of the castle with Luigi as well. And everytime they complete a level more level's are open for playing. Please enjoy this kinda okay game. Note: the animator in Unity 5 didn't want to cooperate so that's why Mario is always in his movement animation, and yes I used Unity 5 because it's the latest version of Unity that support's javascrpt. PS: In level one you need to restart it so you can finish it, the button to restart the level is on the top left corner. PPS: The controls are WASD and the mouse(mouse button 1 for jump, and mouse button 2 is for running). PPPS: for some reason Unity decided to be a b***h, so you have to say to your antivirus to that the game is not a virus (even thou I didn't do anything).Enjoy!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Models used are property of Nintendo, and the Peach's castle is made by mStuff on Sketchfab:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/peach-castle-a21cffbe8b8c4ae9b1614f26f2da8fed\u00a0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d5431568f362def5fcf487a68c77f1b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kringleberg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
