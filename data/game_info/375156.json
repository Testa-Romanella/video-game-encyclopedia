But not bad for 5 days. My apologies for any issues you experience in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must collect ingredients around the kitchen to make a sandwich. All In 5 minutes. Just walk up to an ingredient and press SPACE. You may have to add more bread to your body to reach certain ingredients. You can do this by going over to the Oven. If you are too tall, No worries, just throw away the extra pieces in the garbage can. Once you have all the ingredients on your body, walk over to the plate. But dont forget the press the mustard or mayonnaise button. Otherwise your sandwich wont be made. You will also have to find your 2 missing arms located somewhere in the kitchen. You will need those to complete the sandwich. Without them you cant collect enough ingredients and complete your sandwich.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T06:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc5/cc545ecdec5026f90d4926ad380254e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["redblox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
