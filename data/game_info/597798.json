{"id": 597798, "slug": "bugs-are-coming-sunflower", "name": "Bugs Are Coming, Sunflower!", "name_original": "Bugs Are Coming, Sunflower!", "description": "<p>Game originally made for the Spring 2D Jam 2021.</p>\n<p>A beautiful garden sits waiting to blossom and <strong>grow,</strong> awaiting the eager hands of Spring. Unfortunately, some nasty Bugs are trying to eat the innocent flowers! As the sole protector of Sunflower Ranch, you, a sunflower, must overcome the odds and defend your ranch, your garden, and your pride!</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong><strong>volume warning, have the application at low volume ,and adjust manually to preferred\u00a0liking </strong><strong>(you can pause in-game\u00a0using Spacebar)</strong><strong>*</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>:</p>\n<p>Defend your land by shooting pellets at oncoming bugs. Any bugs that manage to cross over the red line of doom will be able to sprint past you and make it to your garden, resulting in a loss. Survive 5 days of ever increasing (or should I say <strong>growing</strong>) difficulty against the bug horde, and emerge victorious.</p>\n<p>Note: There is a 20 second rest period in each wave, so that waiting is intentional.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls and mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Shoot your merciless pellets at the unassuming bugs using the Left Mouse Button,\u00a0and use your WASD keys to move Up and Down lanes, and to move Left and Right as well.</p>\n<p>You can hit the Spacebar button\u00a0for a pause, and you can also hold Shift to run faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Download Help:</strong></p>\n<p>This is only a Windows build and you have to unzip the files. It should be pretty easy to unzip but if not I recommend downloading Peazip, which is a\u00a0free alternative to Winzip and works the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art lovingly made by frodoTimBaku</p>\n<p>Coding well typed by Yammmmmy</p>\n<p><strong>Music Sources:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\"Adventure\" - Syncopika</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/adventure</p>\n<p>\"National March of Quan and Raiku\" - Spring</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/national-march-of-quan-and-raiku</p>\n<p>\"Lines of Code\" - Trevor Lentz</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lines-of-code</p>\n<p>\"Solemn March\" - Yubatake</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/solemn-march<br/></p>\n<p>\"March of the Wizards\" - Aureolus_Omicron</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/march-of-the-wizards<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb4dd80a291f5bcab423ff64640276d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frodoTimBaku", "yammmmmy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
