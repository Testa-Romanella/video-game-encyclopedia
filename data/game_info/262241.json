Adding the rule that you're not allowed to move directly to the previous square brought the game to an incredibly difficult level.</p>\n\n<p>Made by Katarina &amp; Domagoj from Croatia.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/57690b2e55dc62cf32989b37921e8413.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DocMaggie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
