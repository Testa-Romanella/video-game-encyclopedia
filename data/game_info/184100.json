(Build 1)<br/>This is a work in progress. <br/>I'm planning to make a Let's Play video of this build on clydebink's Youtube channel so that I can explain what I'm trying to do.<br/>Everything is colored wildly because I need to be able to reference walls when discussing where to go with this game. <br/>Simbiotiqu is coming onto the project so we need to be able to communicate about the space. <br/>The lighting will be much more noticable once we use lit textures for the walls, but it was distorting the colors.</p><p>Credits:<br/>Tools used: <br/>Game-engine: Unity 5<br/>Level Design: Probuilder with ProGrids<br/>Sound: Music Creator 7 (with Cakewalk VSTs) to create samples, Audacity for audio finishing<br/>Image manipulation (for some textures): Gimp</p><p>Simbiotiq is using: Blender</p><p>10/13/2015 (Build 2)<br/>I made the piece of art that I've had in mind this entire time for the gallery. It is inspired by \"Constrction\"<br/>http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/9600<br/> <br/>-Starting to import models and textures from Simbiotiq<br/>--3D models<br/>---pedestals<br/>--textures<br/>---gold swirl.<br/>---ornate ribbon (currently used for many things including the curtains).<br/> <br/>-added a buoyancy system to the character-controller inspired and informed by this talk by Ziba Scott<br/>https://youtu.be/OOeA0pJ8Y2s</p><p>11-16-15 (Build 3)<br/>I'm fumbling as I try to create art for the space. No biggies, but progress is slow. I've been working on the wintery-room a little bit, but I will probably axe it.</p><p>Simbiotiq made the ground texture, the vine texture and the fish (along with its animation). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a0/3a0ab1829e9cf3fe4d1c9edaa662a8ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["clyde"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
