Instead of reaping souls, <strong>Thanatos</strong>, the Angel of Death, has to deal with his <strong>teenage daughter Prim</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>Every night, Prim has the same dream: An oddly familiar <strong>human boy cries out for her help</strong>. Needless to say that our heroine tries to answer the call. There\u2018s just one tiny problem: The Grim Reaper has strictly forbidden her to enter the Realm of the Living \u2013 she\u2018s not ready for the immense power she\u2018d develop there, he claims. <br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when Prim finds a way to trick her father and travel to Earth, it painfully turns out that Thanatos\u2018s presentiments have been right all along...<br/></p>\n\n<p>At its core, PRIM is a story of <strong>a father learning to let go</strong> and <strong>a girl finding out who she really is</strong>. But it's also a thrilling adventure, full of magic and darkness. On her journey, Prim repeatedly has to <strong>switch between the Realm of the Dead and the Land of the Living</strong>, where she faces demons, real ones and ones within herself, while always being accompanied by her <strong>sidekick</strong><strong>, an </strong><strong>eye with spider legs</strong>.</p>\r\nKey features\n<ul><li><strong>Hand drawn HD artwork and traditional frame-by-frame animation</strong></li><li><strong>Simple one-click interface</strong></li><li><strong>6-8 hours of varied gameplay<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Text: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Voice over: English, German</strong></li><li><strong>Atmospheric orchestral soundtrack</strong></li><li><strong>Control multiple characters</strong></li><li><strong>In-game hint system, hot-spots and fast-travel<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Mini games, such as a deck-building card game </strong>\n</li></ul>\r\nTry the free demo!\r\n<ul><li><strong>Release: Feb 2, 2021<br/></strong></li><li><strong>For PC, Mac and Linux<br/></strong></li><li><strong>30-60 minutes of gameplay</strong></li><li><strong>Texts in English, German, Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Russian!</strong></li><li><strong>Voice over in English and German<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Are you stuck and need a walkthrough?</strong> <strong>https://youtu.be/OG-gccKcTm4</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dear Linux users,<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Before being able to run the game, please open the config.ini file and set FULLSCREEN = no</p>\n<p>In case you use a screen resolution which is lower than Full HD (1920x1080), please also add:</p>\n<p>RESIZEABLE = yes</p>\n<p>RESOLUTION = <strong>1366x768</strong> (please type in YOUR resolution here)</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, CONTACT jonas@prim-game.com</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdbbebbd8cb35460a4af6af53c543ee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Common Colors"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
