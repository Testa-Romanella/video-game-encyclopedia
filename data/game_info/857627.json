Its soil houses the most power-efficient mineral ever to exist across the Universe - the turanium. With it in their firm grasp, the Sloths have colonized the worlds within their reach. They are a highly intelligent race of tech-heads and industrialists, for whom there are no insurmountable barriers, they just bring them down and go for more.<br />\nTuria and entertainment are as different, as chalk and cheese, yet there is one thing locals enjoy the most and the name for their passion is \u00abracing\u00bb. When you have access to powerful fuel, ordinary cars just get toasted into a crisp, so this is the point where you seek a more horse power-loaded beast.<br />\nThe Wasteland League is the most prestigious championship around these parts.<br />\nOnly the multi ton Turbojunks can qualify for the races. And the one and only task for you to tackle is to speed up this oversized monster and cross the finish line first. To leave them all is about more than just pedal to the metal, it is also about infusing even more power into your metal companion: use special chain boosters, heed your inner voice for the right turn up the heat to preserve inertia and rush on. Only the most desperate Sloths have got what it takes to win over and over again!</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY<br />\nDiverse tracks with challenging sharp turns and sections long and straight as an airstrip for you to quench your thirst for speed.
