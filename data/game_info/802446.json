A demo level from our game Bounty.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBounty is a first-person shooter bounty-hunting game. The player lands on a space station overrun with robotic bounty hunters. The player must locate and kill the bounty. The player is equipped with a six-shooter that shoots explosive rounds. The player fights through the robot bounty hunters to claim the ultimate prize, his reward. The game is a tactical first-person game. The robots are just as deadly as the six shooters the character wields. The player uses a cover system to avoid being shot. The cover system allows the player to return fire in a deadly firefight a little more safely. The game's plot is to create a mix of wild west gunslingers in a future period. The story behind this bounty hunter is that his father owes money to an intergalactic crime syndicate. This bounty is the \u201clast\u201d job for the crime family before he can free his father from his debt or so he thinks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T03:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ba/5bad0d5393345fd049d0b817921fdb20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wormbrain", "Cupine Army"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wormbrain", "Cupine Army"], "esrb_rating": null}
