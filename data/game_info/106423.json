Everything seems normal at first... until a strange \"link\" is uncovered. Conspiracy theories circulate around an incident the previous academic year, when a mass murder occurs at Sacred Heart Village. One by one, a student is killed each month, and the mastermind is never unmasked. To top it off, one of MSCI's alumna is involved, but even she is proven innocent... or is she?<br/><br/>Come one morning, and the students of MSCI find out that even they have been compromised: someone is re-enacting the Sacred Heart Murders through a long-running game of deadly roulette. This time, they have a chance of unmasking the culprit, but how many lives will the effort cost? The time has started, and the game is on.<br/><br/>Besides, what interest is there?</p>\n<p>Note: Contains copyrighted music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c3/4c3ede70d241d276f70ecc2208f874a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jamie D.W."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
