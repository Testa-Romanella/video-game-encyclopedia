You join Sprout, a small seed ready to begin his journey to become a mature tree. All you need to do is roll right to reach your goal! Should be easy right?</p>\n<p>Sprout is a platformer in which you start with only one input unlocked, moving to the right, but Sprout will grow as you traverse the level, which gives you the ability to use more inputs. Each additional input changes the way you traverse and interact with the level, leading to overlapping lapping level design that requires you to think about the best way to move forward.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Spring 2D\u00a0Jam 2021.\u00a0All code and assets aside from audio were created solely by myself during the 48 hour game jam window. Audio from freesounds.org and bensound.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309b205c72f7ad60fdea4575909da3f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonrador"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
