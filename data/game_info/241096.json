The last 3 people we sent in haven\u2019t returned. They seem simple life forms with advanced technology. This is all we know about them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have found a portal where they slowly merge with our world. But be careful, don\u2019t let your intentions be known! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMove around in their space, interact and behave as normally as you can! Play along and hopefully, you can get us some more information than your predecessors. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWish you luck! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n{THE GAME USES SPATIAL AUDIO SO CHECK YOUR HEADPHONES BEFORE PLAYING}", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/66471e0188c21ed9089e0e8ca982e5e1.jpg", "website": "http://www.improvive.com/en/portfolio/vr-experience-a-stickman-reality/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImproVive"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["ImproVive"], "esrb_rating": null}
