The constraints were to have a first or third person character-camera controller, have three levels, each with a \u00ab key \u00bb leading to the next one and an ending.</p>\n<p>In this game, you can choose to die and go to the Purgatory. In there you will have to go through three challenges to determine if you should go to Heaven or Hell.</p>\n<p>The game has multiple endings and a guide to help you with the game.</p>\n<p>I think it's somewhat fun on its own, principally for the little story between you and the guide.</p>\n<p>Go have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c804567dcc5587ddcecf116736ab5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Khalios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
