The story is told from the perspective of a  woman who is suffering from a mental illness, possibly postpartum  depression.  Her husband John trivializes her suffering and prescribes  her \u201crest therapy\u201d.  Read \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d herehttps://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf \r\n</p>\n<p>Just Barely finished and the game has bugs!  Look for updates! Known bugs: Journal and desk need better artwork(LOL)! Want to add mini games to look out the window Want a scary platformer level and add a \u201cNighttime\u201d level maybe.\r\n</p>\n<p>Opening screen: press space to play\r\n</p>\n<p>Main  room:Use arrow keys to move around the room.

Reach the Journal,the narrator\u2019s Cathartic outlet, to return to the  main room.\r\n</p>\n<p>return to the main room: sorry didn\u2019t have time for a  better ending!
