The front served as office space and examination rooms, while the doctor and his family lived upstairs.\u00a0 One day, a frantic mother arrived carrying her 6-year-old daughter, Sallie. The child had collapsed from severe abdominal pain. The doctor diagnosed appendicitis and knew there was no time to delay surgery. Believing the appendix would soon burst, the doctor began cutting Sallie before the anesthesia took full effect. Sallie\u2019s screams suddenly stopped and she grew pale and limp. She died on the operating table \u2013 her last memories of a man whom she believed was torturing her.\r\n</p>\r\nHauntings at the Sallie House\r\n<p>Though the house had long been known to be haunted, Sallie\u2019s haunting grew ominous in 1993, when the house was rented to a young couple. Their dog seemed to growl at nothing, especially near the upstairs nursery. \u00a0 Things began to take a violent turn, however. Fires broke out in the house and a series of sinister attacks on the husband began. The operating area would become cold. Objects would visibly move when the young man drew near. He could feel scratches upon his chest or abdomen. But never did the ghost attack the wife or baby.\r\n</p>\n<p>Events that have been witnessed by visitors to the Sallie House include:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>video and investigative equipment that stop working\r\n</li><li>batteries that are full immediately and completely draining\r\n</li><li>experience moving objects\r\n</li><li>unexplained scratches or bruising on their bodies during/after visits\r\n</li><li>physical touches\r\n</li><li>mysterious coldness\r\n</li><li>Trained guide dogs refuse to enter the nursery\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>A game about mental health. <strong>Now being serious.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p><em>Warning: the game still has bugs, it is under development for a game jam.</em><br/></p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>W - Move Forward\u00a0\r\n</li><li>S - Move Backward\r\n</li><li>D - Strafe Right\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A - Strafe Left\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Mouse Rotation - Rotate The Grabbed Object Around\r\n</li><li>E - Action\r\n</li><li>Left Click: Grab.
