Can the two help each other find their way out of purgatory?\u00a0</p><p>This game is designed as an experimental installation game with a unique controller of \u00a084 buttons, and two monitors.

However it should function with other set-ups in the near future.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Game play Overview</strong><br/></p><p>The game play was designed to encourage constant communication between the players in an asymmetrical cooperative experience to navigate a maze filled with dangers.</p><p>The player playing as Persephone can see a top down view of the underworld but only one square at a time.
