It features a simplified version of Angel Island Act 1 with some tweaks. Various classic Sonic games were used as reference, including the 8-bit games (Game Gear and Master System) which have sprites closer to what PICO-8's resolution and color palette, and the GBA titles which have more clear-cut graphics.</p>\n<p>The project was started as a personal challenge and was meant to be a fully-fledged fan game, but I eventually dropped many features to focus on Sonic's main movements and the exploration of the stage. Consider it a technical demo with some exploration challenge.</p><p>Disclaimer: the game runs on a patched version of PICO-8 that doesn't have the original token count limitation. However, I do respect the (compressed) characters limit for each cartridge.<br/></p>\n<p>pico sonic is a fan game distributed for free and is not endorsed by Sega.

Scale is close to 1:1, but Sonic is slightly smaller (relatively to the environment) than in the original game.</p>\n<p>The game uses a custom map \"streaming\" system to allow a bigger map than PICO-8's standard tilemap. There are no enemies, hazards, rings nor item boxes. Rocks are not destructible.</p>\n<p>Some enemies have been replaced by static obstacles, and most importantly some items have been replaced by emeralds that can be collected to make the stage more interesting.</p>\n<p>Stage gimmicks:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Spring</li><li>Loop</li><li>Launch ramp</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can play with keyboard or gamepad with those inputs:</p>\n<p>Left/right arrows</p>\n<strong>Keyboard</strong>\n<strong>Gamepad</strong>\n<strong>Action</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft/right arrows\r\nD-pad left/right\r\nMove\r\n\r\n\r\nDown arrow\r\nD-pad down\r\nRoll (during run)\r\n\r\n\r\nZ/C/N\r\nFace button up/down\r\nJump\r\n\r\nX/V/M\r\nFace button left/right\r\nCancel (menu)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter\r\nStart\r\nOpen pause menu\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you gamepad mapping is not correct, you can customize it with SDL2 Gamepad Tool and copy-paste the configuration line into sdl_controllers.txt in PICO-8's configuration directory.
