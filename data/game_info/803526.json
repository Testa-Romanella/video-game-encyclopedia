Pull them for different parts of the body, and the rest will be done by physics... well, almost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But not everything is so simple! Gravity, traps, slippery surfaces - all this interferes with your super important goal. And then all sorts of useful things come to your aid, such as a teleport.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also unlock other characters and change from one beautiful square face to another at any time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game features four game modes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>* \"To the top!\" - here you need to get to the highest platform;\u00a0</p>\n<p>* \"Flood\" - water will follow you, hurry up!\u00a0</p>\n<p>* \"Endless\" - endless jumps up;\u00a0</p>\n<p>* \"Jumping with friends\" - compete with friends up to four people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are three levels of difficulty in each mode: from easy - for beginners to comprehend the skill of jumping, to high - for those who crave a challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for?
