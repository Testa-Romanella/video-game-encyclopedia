The objective of this game is to stay dreaming as long as possible by using the <strong>left</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>right arrow keys</strong> to punch oncoming walking alarm clocks that will wake you up if you collide with them. Make sure to\u00a0<strong>time your punches</strong> correctly, as you will only punch once as you tap any of the keys.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and Special Thanks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming by me :)</p>\n<p>Art by me :)</p>\n<p>Music from Little Big Planet 2, Sonic The Fighters</p>\n<p>Sound from Sound Bible, Sonic The Fighters</p>\n<p>Special thanks to the folks at Spartasoft who started this game jam :)</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this game in one night.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T12:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/9148c93574ebd90066742165948d8976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TrickWithATwist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
