Then again, maybe stick to a slightly less-challenging\u00a0boss mode. Bosses spawn instead of enemies at an alarming rate in this mode, and elite bosses also spawn. Play as the basic green ship, the flamethrower orange ship, the laser blue ship, the fast-firing cyan ship, the firework purple ship, or the supernova yellow ship/black hole black ship.
