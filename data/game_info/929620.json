Dr Gillies and his team . As a result of their work and discoveries, untold numbers of injured, crippled and disfigured persons were able to overcome trauma that had previously been untreatable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The patients needing facial reconstruction experienced some of the most incomprehensible trauma as a result of their injuries, left with their reflection no longer being their own. Many lost lovers, friends and family over their new appearances and were subject to the constant gaze of society. At Sidcup it was said that there were no mirrors as these self-appointed \u201cBroken Gargoyles\u201d had such a level of psychological trauma they couldn't risk seeing their own reflection and blue benches were created so they soldiers could sit peacefully without the risk of stares as the blue colour signalled to all passer bys that a \u201cBroken Gargoyle\u201d may be sitting there and they should avert their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The surgeries and prosthetics provided at Sidcup changed many people's lives but the trauma they carried haunted them always a reflection away.
