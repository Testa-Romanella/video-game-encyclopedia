Ector don't have any combat abalities and have only 1  HP, so be careful around enemies. Try to complete all the levels to  finally reach the... \"end\".

You can see on the top left of your screen how many power you have  left. You just need to finish each levels without being damaged once. Oh  and remember that you can't be touch by any enemies !
