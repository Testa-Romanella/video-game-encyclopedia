Sometimes that might be as simple as \"this level focuses on moving platforms\" while other times it might be extremely gimmick focused like \"this level changes from night to day\"\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Levels are very straightforward, and I've always found that I get burnt out in mario games when I play level after level. To break things up, the overworlds provide you with small, nonstressful explorational challenges. They allow you to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the music.</p>\n<p>Music, game, and graphics are by me. I hope you enjoy!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T08:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f01548334a1a3d9324f60bccd3c201b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ConnorLeary"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
