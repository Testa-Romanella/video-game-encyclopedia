We challenged ourselves to make a game in one month as we were teenagers with very low knowledge about game development.</p>\n<p>It's a simple game where you have to move your way around the asteroids using the arrow keys. Press ENTER in order to start the game.</p>\n<p>There are many bugs and other problems in this game, and we probably won't ever fix them as this project is more than 3 years old now.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Design</strong> - Ga\u00ebtan Piou, Philippe-Albert Leblanc, Romane Carraud<br/><strong>Programming</strong> - Ga\u00ebtan Piou<br/><strong>Art</strong> - Romane Carraud<br/><strong>Music</strong> - Philippe-Albert Leblanc</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>A huge thanks to Collin HENRY, Elliot Lazla\u00efan Panard and Malo L. for their help on the project !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T08:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff7984fccc3cc957973790bf0fb691a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ga\u00ebtan Piou", "Palicraft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
