I am uploading this version of the game even if it's still in the beginning stages of development because I feel like it will help in the development of the game. Getting some feedback would make the game better overall. nothing in the game is final especially the main player movement/physics.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is only one map that has been quickly thrown to gather to play on and movement is still kind of wired. Its just a developer build to have something to test.</p>\n<p>Movement can be changed in the settings menu under key binding settings, only supports base keys for the moment. if there is a key that does not work that you want added please comment.</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be helpful and is very appreciated. I'll be posting regular updates on the game as time goes on.</p>\n<p>Currently working on for\u00a0update v0.0.2</p>\n<ul><li>A better map to play on</li><li>Better Movement and shooting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:19:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f1e43c97e1c7afd1eb610641c318845.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PCGamer036"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
