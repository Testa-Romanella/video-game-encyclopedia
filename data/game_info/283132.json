Well, you may try if you wish but it won\u2019t help you to win.<br/><br/>The idea is to touch the screen in turn with your opponent.<br/>Sounds easy? \u2013 It does!<br/>Is it easy to win? \u2013 Not at all!<br/>With each touch the game becomes more and more dynamic. Touching the screen not in your turn will reverse the course of the game in favor of your opponent.<br/><br/>Have you both caught the rhythm?<br/>Skip your turn, break the rhythm, and probably your opponent will make an extra touch, giving you more chances to win.<br/><br/>The game features a single-player training mode but nothing is as joyful as playing in a team!<br/>Invite your friends to play with you and enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0fab9d1b32aa5975adcde83d4f4b0fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dmitriy Polyakov"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family"], "publishers": ["Dmitriy Polyakov"], "esrb_rating": null}
