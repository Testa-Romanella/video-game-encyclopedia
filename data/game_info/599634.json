The purpose of this was to convey a meaning or point of view in regards to mediated violence. As a gaming student, my team and I\u00a0find the media portrays games as this huge influencer in real world violence when evidence supports violent games as a stress reliever and a source of anger management. We decided to make a violent game and have our classmates play it to see if they got more violent to reiterate our point of view in a more creative fasion than a video explaining the facts. The end resulted in no one being\u00a0influenced in any way by playing it hence communicating our point\u00a0nicely.\u00a0</p><p>**This is an unfinished Game**</p><p>**It will not be iterated on further**</p><p><strong>In Game Instructions:</strong></p><p>- Press\u00a0WASD to move.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Press E to Interact.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Press \"MouseButton1\" / \"LeftMoustButton\" to Swing Axe.</p><p>- Press \"P\" to end the game.
