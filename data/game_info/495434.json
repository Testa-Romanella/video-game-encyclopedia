The music and lyrics were inspired by the literary work of Thomas Ligotti.\u00a0Acephalic further explores the themes of nihilism, cosmic indifference and social construct of productivity through the prism of the anti-Vitruvian man, the acephalic man.</p>\n<p>This is my first experience with game design after 15 years of work as a video artist and post-industrial musician. Video games have always been my main inspiration and passion. My master's thesis examined the subway in video games and I had the chance to publish several articles about the medium. The Covid-19 isolation finally enabled me to learn the process and create my own object.</p>\n<p>I wished through this initiatory process to explore the potential relation between industrial/noise sounds and interactivity - abstraction, harshness, dynamism, distorsion, etc.\u00a0Acephalic is the first step in that direction and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>\n<p>Everything by Death Orgone/Frederick Maheux except:<br/>Real Human Brain by Stuart7<br/>2_pipe_shotgun by Harlad<br/>Scalpel by BiOzZ<br/>Shotgun Blast sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T06:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/7499b03e2f76b808cc4339632cb0e97a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Death Orgone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
