With elements from Risk combined with other hex-based games, the basic goal is to eliminate the other players from the board, all of whom choose their own color. Each territory has an energy stockpile, and both buying and maintaining pieces per turn requires a certain amount of energy based on the piece level. If the territory doesn't have enough energy to maintain its pieces, it will go bankrupt. A piece can take one enemy hex per turn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T10:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/51836086932ee253be99c856ed3d7e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nulisar"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
