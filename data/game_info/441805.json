{"id": 441805, "slug": "bitch", "name": "bitch", "name_original": "bitch", "description": "<p><em>bitch</em> is a game created in Twine Harlowe 3. The player (when playing as a woman) experiences microaggressions and even a proposition for quid-pro-quo harassment. On the other hand, the player can also choose to play as a man, who notices a few strange things in the office, but overall comes out unscathed. The game is best experienced when played more than once, and at least once from each perspective.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c01f7145f726f8d31cc0279dfcfaa7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eredler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
