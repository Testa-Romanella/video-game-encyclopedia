Each grade from 3rd to 6th designed their own game where the player must solve math problems.\u00a0These students designed mechanics and rules for their games. Students also contributed the artwork for characters, items, and environments. They even composed the game's soundtrack.</p>\n<p>The 3rd grade students created an RPG where the player must battle mathematical monsters to earn cards.</p>\n<p>The 4th grade students decided on a racing game where the player controls animals, solving questions for speed boosts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The 5th grade team worked on a restaurant game where the player must deliver food with the right ingredients.</p>\n<p>The 6th grade team created a flying game where the player controls a flying fish. They must fly through rings to answer questions and save their cactus girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Josh Poll, a university student, then helped out with implementation using Unreal Engine 4. He served as the translator for all of the children's ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e9175de40badc866cce9ea11f90aef78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Poll"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
