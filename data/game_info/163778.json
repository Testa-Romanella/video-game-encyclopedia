The game will start automatically after launching. Use your arrow keys to move the tank, and space bar to fire.</p>\n<p>This was one of the very first games I ever made. It is admittedly quite basic, and was not intended to be any more than that. Feel free to use any of my game assets if you'd like. Given that the XNA Framework is no longer supported by Microsoft, I can no longer open the source code, therefore it goes without saying, there will not be any updates xD\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Installation Instructions:\u00a0<br/>1. Run the self-extracting ZIP file\r\n<br/>2. Install the XNA Framework redistributable within the \"Redist\" folder\r\n<br/>3. Start the \"Breakout.exe\" launcher</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/968/9689fc7e67d0b320874722989bc7c94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dnnp2011"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
