Carpenter's Once Upon a Tide is a text piece - part narrative, part instructional document - that started in the digital space. Recently a printed iteration was published by Penned in the Margins. Above is a translation/remix back into a digital format. <br/><br/>In J.R. Carpenter's original, the reader/participant is allowed a series of controls at the end of each reading to speed up, slow down, or shift the text. In this remix the controls are presented, but held out of reach, pressed frantically by the writing itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c05/c059252df9dd698a9beda437763d41ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick Murray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
