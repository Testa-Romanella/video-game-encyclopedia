They can range from <strong>interactive fanart</strong> to <strong>momentary whimsy</strong>, from\u00a0<strong>tool research</strong> and\u00a0experimentation to well-defined <strong>prototypes </strong>for potential bigger projects. They're a space for trying out <strong>collaborations </strong>with minimal consequences and scope. They're made in a few days over the course of a single month.</p>\n<p><strong>MOODS</strong> are not games, they're windows into a scattershot creative process, aimed only at offering \"stuff\" to \"play\".</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>TOWNBLOCK</strong> is inspired by The Urbz on GBA.\u00a0It's a technical and aesthetic experiment designed around the idea of \"walking around a city block in an isometric perspective\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em><strong>Keyboard controls:</strong></em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrows </strong>or <strong>numpad diagonals</strong> to move.</li><li><strong>Spacebar </strong>to interact when prompted.</li></ul>\n<p>=====</p>\n<p><strong><em>CREDITS</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>@skymen75 - Ossama Jouini - BetterOutlines plugin</li><li>@ben_304 - Ben Chandler - Environment art</li><li>@lavantdapres - Camille C. - Character animation, coding</li><li>@morusque - Yann Van Der Cruyssen -\u00a0Sound effects</li><li>Music by Ketsa on FreeMusicArchive:<ul><li><em>Alit</em></li><li><em>Soul Zone</em></li><li><em>Never\u00a0Give Up</em></li></ul></li><li>Additional sound effects from SoundJay.</li><li>Made using Construct 3.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T07:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d9951d44d76da7dd757ed55010fecb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pehesse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
