The meaning of \u201ctactical\u201d and \u201cteam\u201d is only imply that situational awareness and cooperation with teammates is the key to win on the battlefield.<br/>The standard and brutal \u201cRun-and-Gun\u201d play style is not off limits, it\u2019s just less suitable. Much less.Build your own classThat\u2019s right! Make your very own loadouts with no restrictions on weapons or tactical gadgets. Rifles, pistols, machine guns, knives, explosives, whatever you like! No strict classes. Only you choose what to bring to battle. <br/><br/>So, use it for your advantage, gear up and make the streets shake with the rumble of bullets!One battleground - different scenariosVarious game modes across each map:<br/><br/><strong>Demolition</strong><br/>Two teams, two sites to protect or destroy (with explosive charge).
