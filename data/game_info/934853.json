Demolition is inevitable for the company as it has been abandoned after the fire in 2004. The facility has been investigated a lot recently and it is your turn to watch over one last night there before the Demolition commences. The sounding of the alarm will frighten anyone who is near. This demolition process is very dangerous, and will kill anyone who tries to intervene. Some investigations have been sent down into the abandoned facility of Stan's Robotic Rentals to make sure that nothing seemingly strange has happened there within the past 17 years. 17 years ago, an employee named Josiah tampered with one of the animatronics and caused a fire. This damaged lots of the equipment and machines within the facility and unfortunately lead to Josiah's Death, or so that is the story believed by everyone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T09:01:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11cd154023a982fb476c2d1f73a44eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RilzLaFFY"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
