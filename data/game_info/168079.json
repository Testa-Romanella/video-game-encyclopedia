It's a warm summers night; three friends are camping out in the woods, sitting by the fire. Little do they know that the fire is the only thing keeping them safe from death, from a killer, from you. </p><p>As the campers venture off into the darkness, it is your job to stalk and kill them all without being caught.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>- W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys to move.</p><p>- Left Shift to sprint.</p><p>- Left Click to attack</p><p>- Space Bar to jump (not really needed)</p><p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p><p>- Kill everyone without getting caught.</p><p>- You can get caught by walking within the AI's line of sight, which is highlighted with a very subtle, transparent shade of blue.</p><p>- If you walk within their line of sight(s), you are caught and you lose the game.</p><p>* Note that there is a line of sight surrounding the campfire while 1 or more people are still there*</p><p><strong>Personal Notes:</strong></p><p>I know this game isn't a traditional game, but it is what it is and I hope you enjoy it. I made it in under 48 hours, so it's a little ugly looking and very simple, but I think it's a cool idea. Hopefully no one gets offended that this game is about killing innocent people, I just got the idea from the Ludum Dare theme (\"You Are The Monster\") and from my new-found addiction to 'scary story' videos on YouTube. Please rate this game well on its Ludum Dare page if you participated in the compo/jam. Happy killing :) </p><p><strong>Boring Stuff:</strong><br/></p><p><em>Made for Ludum Dare 33, 48 hour compo.
