A (sort of) fast paced tower defense. With lots of unique spins to the generic tower defense game, this is like no other!</p>\n<p>It's a war between pandas and zombies. The zombies have planned a attack, and the pandas must defend their bamboo forest homeland.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is pre-alpha! This is not the full game, this is just the pre-alpha version. This will probably not represent the full game very much.</p>\n<p>NOTE: For Mac(and maybe Windows) users, you have to download this wonderful game through the (not as wonderful) itch.io desktop app.</p>\n<p>Trailer made by the wonderful iq3q\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGjm6cxfpo7G2EH1RNIVXQ\u00a0Go check him out!</p><p>Discord server link!
