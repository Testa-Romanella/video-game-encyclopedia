It\u2019s up to the mighty Megazonk to halt the alien threat and save the day! Balance between fighting off monsters and helping civilians, removing Zonk limbs and delegating them to tasks matching their speciality. Remember that Megazonk is at their strongest when all 4 Zonks are together as one. Most importantly, defend the orphanage at all costs. If it\u2019s destroyed, it\u2019s game over. The children are our future!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel - Scroll through limb selections (1 through 4 also act as hot selects, 5 being no limbs)</p>\n<p>Right click - Detach / Reattach \"Zonk\" limb</p>\n<p>Left click - Use currently selected Zonk (If attached.
