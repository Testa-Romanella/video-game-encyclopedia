Being in the dark slowly drains you and then kills you.\u00a0 Though it's not always bad. After all, <em>Failure is Progress.</em></p>\n\n<p>Hello there!</p>\n<p>Welcome to my 2nd ever game jam game. I hope you enjoy playing it. I am very excited that I managed to finish this game\u00a0 even after having prior engagements that ate significantly into my time. Sorry for no Linux build yet, I need to install the correct module for it :P</p>\n<p>Quite excited for the feedback. Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>CREDITS: The beautiful tileset you see is from opengameart.com:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/deep-night-8x8-platformer-assets</p><p>Some of the sounds are also from there, but unfortunately I don't have the links, sorry :(</p><p>The player character and floaty orb spirit when you die thing are the only things I made in terms of art lol.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Yes you can win this game. It's quite easy, really. ;P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:33:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Spacejet13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
