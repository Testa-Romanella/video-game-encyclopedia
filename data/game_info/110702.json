You can build your character to be more active, or slow and steady so you can level up while you do other tasks.</p><p>This is my very 1st game(outside of classes). It was mostly meant as a learning tool, but I do plan on doing balance updates and perhaps some graphics updates over time.</p><p>Please report any bugs to ryringames.com or @ryringames on Twitter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1271af8c1da815ce1585c8519cc95eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pontelon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
