It's a roguelite\u00a0where you fight monsters\u00a0using babies with different abilities, based on familiars from The Binding of Isaac. Fight bosses, complete various challenges and craft the most effective strategy to win! <strong>And if you haven't played TBoI or Plants vs. Zombies yet, you should buy them right now.</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the sprites and effects were made by me, but I still used many assets from TBoI: Rebirth (for which, of course, I do not take credit) to give the game an authentic look. The game's also uses various OST written by Ridiculon (with the exception of the wonderful \"Drowned Sorrows\" track by Nicolas Mayer), as well as many sound effects from these games. Playing the game further you'll find some epic cameo-characters, referencing various mods and other members of the Isaac community.</p>\n<p>The game is deep in alpha, which means that it's kinda playable, but\u00a0it doesn't have much content yet. I still have a lot of ideas, so expect more content in later updates. Or not.</p>\n<p><strong>And don't ask about Android ports and such just right now, I'd be glad, but I have very little experience in porting stuff</strong> (as in game development itself, lol)</p>\n<p>Well, I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls/Hints</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Collect hearts and buy babies to fight monsters. I mean, why not.</li><li>B. Bobbies shoot tears at enemies, Little C.H.A.Ds produce more hearts, Cubes of Meat can be used to protect other babies, and Bob's Brain used to deal with\u00a0strong enemies and remove obstacles.</li><li>Using\u00a0Q key you can\u00a0speed up/slow down the game (just like in PvZ 2)</li><li>You can also use 1-4 keys to grab babies and E key to grab an active item (without dragging your mouse around the screen every time)</li></ul>\n<p>My Twidder:\u00a0Doctor_Hummer</p>\n<p>My Discord channel:\u00a0Starbox</p>\n<p>My Patreon:\u00a0doctorhummer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-14T21:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/623/623f7b1e8d83311c8459b7a669d42ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorHummer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
