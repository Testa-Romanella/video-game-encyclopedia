Part of this means giving them a special shot before a full moon to keep them from transforming. Normally, your diligent partner, Dr. Hammond, takes care of this, but on this one fateful night, you hear a frightening howl and realize that all the patients have transformed into werewolves and are roaming around the hospital! It's up to you to sneakily put them all to sleep so they don't hurt anyone.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first jam game and first game on Itch.
