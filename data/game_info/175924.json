What a weekend. Total crunch the last 10 hours, and I am so tired right now. <br/><br/>Didn't have time to make any sound, which is quite the bummer. The effects also didn't get the attention they deserved. <br/><br/>I hope it isn't to unclear as to what to do. There is a tutorial, consisting of some images. <br/><br/>Thank you to my friends for being inspiration for the names of the stars! <br/><br/>EDIT: After playing it now, I have realized that I have accidentally messed up the story objectives.. It says your home is Iris II and your crew is at Mangia I. However, because I finished that feature around 20 minutes before deadline, I must have made a mistake and as such the truth is the opposite! Your crew is at Iris II and your home, and final goal is at Mangia I. <br/><br/>Tools used <br/>------------ <br/>Unity <br/>Blender <br/>Gimp </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c7a96639d907ebba2962697994d47f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MangoMalarkey"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
