Everything changes one evening on New Year&#39;s Eve, when he decided to leave the house and go on business, and instead found himself in a camp already familiar to the reader.</p>\n<p>At first glance, history repeats itself: the bus, the camp, the girls... And nevertheless, small differences gradually accumulate, so that later develop into a completely new story. The hero (or rather heroes) plays an important role in this: he differs from the usual Semyon, and therefore his story is different.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-05T00:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/4034678c3e7a29384975baf047708b83.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/bl_7dl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sanati Tales"], "esrb_rating": null}
