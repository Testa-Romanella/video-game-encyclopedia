The project is currently under going a re-design\u00a0\u00a0after 2 failed pitching events to publishers and some time away.\u00a0<br/><br/>Alot of dedicated people worked really hard on this so it seems a shame not let this project see the light of day. Any funds raised will go straight back into development of the project.\u00a0<br/><br/>When extracting the project from the zip file please use 7-zip as other software tends to corrupt some of the files needed. This is NOT an .exe version of the game.<br/><br/>Xbox &amp; PS4 controllers are semi-supported.\u00a0<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Tether is a first-person adventure game based in a dilapidated science fiction world. Earth is dying after the collapse of several continents throughout the world following the destruction of the Moon - as natural disasters sweep the planet, the newly formed United Environmental Federation (UEF) accelerate plans to terraform the nearest possible habitable planet, Mars.<br/><br/>You play as Lesleigh Hayes - a Biological Research Assistant for the UEF - on her first deep space voyage to Mars. Once aboard the Sonne, Lesleigh's thoughts turn to her children as she re-lives some of their final conversations before leaving. As catastrophic events unfold on the UEF Sonne, Lesleigh is forced to survive the psychological horrors of isolation in deep space.\u00a0<br/><br/>Can she live with the consequences of her choices? How will these affect her children? Is this how motherhood should be?<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Development Team:<br/><br/>Mark Gregory - Level &amp; Narrative Design<br/>Ian McCamant - Writer/Design<br/>Nathan Winfield - Programming &amp; Level Design<br/>Callum Donaldson - Sound Design<br/>Eddy Kassabian - Composer<br/>Rachel Alderson - 2D Art<br/><br/>Voice Artists:</p>\n<p>Tamara Ryan - Lesleigh &amp; Peter<br/>Lucas Shuneman - Sean<br/>Josh Musser - Max<br/>Luke Benning - Ceilion<br/>Anna Chloe Moorey - Kelsey</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T04:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f6423a80b9a5d5f13b5a62000ea314cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freesphere"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
