Each version of QnC is different. In this version, some one needs to take on the role of the QUEST MASTER. This special player will need to be creative and do some prep work ahead of each quest. <strong>The QM will need to design four locations, create four bosses, a final boss, write nine NPCs, four short stories and one ending. </strong>Each of these elements will be used in game. Please read all of the rules before playing! QnC is designed to be played in a multiplayer setting or you may play singleplayer mode! Creatures created in any other version are compatible with this version too!
