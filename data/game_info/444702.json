Although with every experience, I did learn a couple new skills and approach with one being to test a gameplay loop first before writing down all the modular systems....... That being said, I can use that very same system for my passion project so that's also a win.\u00a0</p><p>Overall this game jam was fun and interesting, 10/10 would jam again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f36/f362d7a32c806fcf44ae667a9f560521.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CryoZONE"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
