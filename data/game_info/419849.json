This application is only intended for use as part of a professional therapy with an expert. We strongly advise against using it for self-treatment outside of professional therapy. No liability is heldby the developers for any side effects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The therapist has the possibility to adjust how many pigeons are visible\u00a0in the VR application\u00a0and how close the pigeons can come to the patient. The fact that the virtual pigeons react to the patient is a feature that makes the application particularly valuable for therapy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different scenarios allow for a therapy that is tailored specifically to the needs of the patient.
