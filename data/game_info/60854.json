Watch as space empires endure epic struggles for power. You decide if you want to:<br />\nWatch in Observer mode<br />\nPlay around freely in Sandbox mode<br />\nTake control in Emperor mode<br />\nEmpires will:<br />\nWage war to conquer more stars<br />\nBuild ships to fight and do other strange things<br />\nEncounter strange space monsters<br />\nVenture out on intergalactic quests<br />\nResearch new technology<br />\nSwitch politics between expansion, fortification and more<br />\nBuild powerful (or useless) artifacts in space<br />\nTranscend to unimaginable hyperbliss<br />\nUltimately they will go away, crushed by a stronger race, victims of internal strife, eaten by space monsters, or some other fate. But new ones will take their place. It&#39;s the hypercircle of interstellar life in space.<br />\nFollow the fates of Dynasties and individual people as they rise from low level paper pushers, and rise to become Captains, Ministers or even Emperors.<br />\nIn Emperor mode, you can control your own empire by using your Flagship to boost expansion and defense, build and control your ships, and manage your Spy network.<br />\nIn Sandbox mode, you have full freedom to do pretty much what you want. Make empires degenerate, throw meteors at them, etc.<br />\nOr you can just observe, like an aquarium, except with interstellar space empires instead of fish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7bd3f89d2c546b8d145eab2eae14485.jpg", "website": "http://www.galimulator.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 34, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Snoddasmannen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Snoddasmannen"], "esrb_rating": null}
