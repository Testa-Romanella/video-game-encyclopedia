What will happen if I combine the classic elements of Tic-Tac-Toe with the Strategy and Gameplay of Battleships? - The answer to this idea is BigDuckGo. As the game begins you are able to choose between three levels of difficulty: 1. Easy peasy, 2. Medium rare and 3. Mission Impossible. The matchfield features 4x4 caskets and under each of them is either an X or an O. So your job is to find the 4-in a row X before the AI finds the 4-in a row O...</p>\n<p>BigDuckGo itself is fully written in C++ and is available on Linux and Windows.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/888ba51a0e00ee8b216f76541818c43a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Robin Krause"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
