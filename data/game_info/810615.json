Designed by Fat Baby, a queer trans-masculine non-binary bisexual artist, the collection is a vibrant celebration of both pop culture and queer culture. In addition to a wide array of pop-culture references, the collection features traits that celebrate sex positivity, kink positivity, and queer iconography.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The RAPTOR CITY team believes in taking direct action to support the LGBTQ+ community. To this end, we have donated \u00a38000 to Mermaids, a UK charity that works with gender-diverse young people, and have contributed \u00a315,000 to pay for top surgeries for transgender men and non-binary people. Finally, to minimise the environmental impact of our work, we have used Aerial.is to offset our carbon footprint by investing in forest conservation projects and carbon-capturing technologies. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T05:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a221ab0fb263bf2cae2f371ac5b59db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RaptorCity"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
