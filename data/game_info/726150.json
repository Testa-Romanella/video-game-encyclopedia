Get 10% more health, move 8% faster, etc. So when the restriction was announced to be \"Make it a Roguelike\", a very general restriction, I wanted to make the concept interesting: no passive items. Everything is a new, interactive, responsive weapon you can use. Pair together different weapons and create builds to defeat the final boss.</p>\n<p><em>(The theme was optional and we didn't have any good ideas for it.
