Have you ever wandered around lost, cursing the lack of proper signage? Have you ever thought to yourself \u201cI could design this station better\u201d?<br/><br/><strong>STATIONflow</strong> is a game about controlling the flow of thousands of passengers by building and managing an efficient underground train station.<br/><br/><ul><li>Manage the flow of thousands of passengers with different needs, stats and targets, simulated in real time.<br/></li><li>Build complex 3D layouts in a multilayered map.<br/></li><li>Place and shape corridors and structures freely, without the constraints of a grid.<br/></li><li>Connect your station with stairs, escalators and elevators as efficiently as you can, but make sure everything is accessible.<br/></li><li>Keep things functional and efficient: your goal is to avoid congestion and to get passengers to where they want to go as quickly and smoothly as possible.<br/></li><li>Guide passengers via signage, and watch the flow of passengers change. Manipulate the path people take to avoid crowds\u2014sometimes the shortest route is not the most efficient.<br/></li><li>Satisfy your passengers\u2019 desires for various services: place vending machines and kiosks, construct bathrooms, restaurants and more. Passengers will expect more than just to find their exit on time.<br/></li><li>Don\u2019t forget about upkeeps. You\u2019re on a budget, so you'll want to keep your station lean and efficient\u2060\u2014but make sure it isn't at the cost of passenger satisfaction!<br/></li><li>And of course, the higher-ups are always watching. You will receive daily evaluations based on passenger feedback. Do well, and you will be rewarded with an extended budget and additional construction options, but also given increased responsibilities. Do poorly, and you may well be on your way to bankruptcy...<br/></li><li>Create your own maps and share them through the Steam Workshop, or browse other players' creations for your next playthrough.<br/></li><li>Adjust the game's difficulty to your liking via multiple settings. Give yourself a relaxed sandbox experience, or something to really test your station-building abilities\u2060...</li></ul>Good luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T04:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23ac6048f12f4355e2bb016afac1d62a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DMM Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["DMM GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
