Your goal is to find batteries to power all of the lamps in the maze, as well as lamp knobs and two engine balls, then you seek for the Escape Gate.</p>\n<p>However, the maze is constantly changing and you never know what to expect. Every time you restart the game or lose one of your eight lives, the layout of the maze will be different, and the number of lamps you need to power up with batteries may also vary. This adds an extra layer of challenge to the game, as you'll need to be constantly adapting to the changing environment and thinking on your feet.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you navigate through the dark corridors of the maze, you'll need to be careful not to attract the attention of the monsters. They will only chase you if you are in their way, but they can hear you if you're not careful. Make sure to sneak when you are close to them in order to avoid being caught.\r\n</p>\n<p>To help you on your quest, you'll find batteries scattered throughout the maze that will power up the lamps and light your way. You'll also need to keep an eye out for the lamp knobs and the two engine balls.\r\n</p>\n<p>But beware - the monsters are lurking in the shadows, and if they catch you, you'll lose one of your eight lives. You'll need to keep a cool head and use your wits to evade the monsters and find the necessary items before it's too late.\r\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the main game mode, Lights Out also features a survival mode, where you'll need to last as long as possible against an endless horde of monsters. Can you outsmart and outlast them all in your quest for freedom</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T20:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/833/8337b5fd1fa9abd0d75621499fd5c7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
