Here is the scene for those unfamiliar with the movie:</p><p>The project is meant to simulate a claw machine where you can win an alien from Toy Story.</p><p>For this project I modeled the alien, put a custom mesh collider on each polygon in the alien, and then added 30 instances of the alien and put them inside the claw machine. I added rigidbodies to all of them and then let them settle so they looked natural sitting in the machine.</p><p>I faced two major challenges with this project:</p><p>1) Modeling the aliens ears were very very difficult. For this I basically just spent a long time manipulating a sphere until it looked earlike.</p><p>2) Getting the claw machine physics to work was very challenging. Basically I couldn't get the claw to actually 'grab' the aliens. The game was un-winable using realistic claw machine behavior. So I added a box collider to the claw and created a random number generator. When the claw box collider touches an alien, it generates a random number. The user has a 33% chance to successfully catch an alien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PaulFrank"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
