There are currently 12 levels for you to enjoy, some with multiple solutions.</p>\n<p>We tried to think of an idea for a game that strayed away from randomness as we knew that would be a common interpretation of the jam theme. We are very happy to present our literal interpretation of the theme and hope you enjoy it!</p>\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul>\n<li>UI menus can be a bit touchy, try not to click them too fast! To fix either restart the game or click around the screen a little bit to try and get it to update.</li>\n<li>Once die is rotated to have the two side facing up, it is possible to rotate it an extra time to have it not facing up anymore. This should have no effect on winning the level, however.</li>\n</ul>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\r\n\r\nMechanics Help\r\n<p>The objective of the game is to get the two face of the die facing upwards!</p>\r\nTile Types\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exclusive Tiles</strong> only allow a certain side of the die to be on top of it.</li>\n<li><strong>Rotate Tiles</strong> turn the die 90 degrees either left or right.</li>\n<li><strong>Flip Tiles</strong> turn the die 180 degrees.</li>\n<li><strong>Move Tiles</strong> translate the die in a certain direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Unstable Tiles</strong> will collapse after the die has travelled over it once.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T15:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd9/cd96337b4fba237755c3903558e60c51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Frank Alfano", "Gaby Colon-Melendez"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
