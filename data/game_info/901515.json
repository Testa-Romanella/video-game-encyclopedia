While this museum does cover hitchhikers goodness it also sheds alot of light on his other work. Douglas was a major tech advocate, believer in VR, IOT(it didn't have a name back then), the internet and more. Beyond technology he also supported and promoted conservational efforts like Save the Rhino international and more.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Learn about all of this, his early life, his other books and more! This project uses some paid assets that I have license too, free 3d models are mainly provided by Binkley-Spacetrucker on SketchFab which is amazing! This is very much a community driven project being made by a solo developer as a free time project. All comments, criticism and etc are welcome but any bad mouthing of my personal hero Douglas Adams is off limits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also a non VR version of this in development simultaneously. It is not the priority though and will have limitations placed on it due to the licenses I have for certain assets.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:</p>\n\n<p>This is a community project so the museum will gladly accept submissions for any of the galleries or even add new galleries for materials. VR real estate is super cheap and our landlord isn't a complete jerk so we have lots of room to grow! If you do want to contribute materials please keep the following in mind.</p>\n<p>Please honor his memory and wishes and don't share pirated paid materials through this project or the discussion boards. I want this to be a collection endpoint for Free publically available D.A. things and if we steal copyrighted materials, books, artwork and more we run the risk of losing all of it forever. Please keep Douglas's works out there in the subether and help share his life work with me!</p>\n\n<p>Things that need to be worked on still:</p>\n<ol><li>Traversable Starship Titanic with Bartender and Super Galactic Traveler Pass Bedroom</li><li>Doctor Who Gallery/galleries</li><li>Monty Python Gallery (yes, I know he didn't write for python, this is all about his friendships with Chapman and others for Python.</li><li>Dirk Gently Gallery</li><li>Douglas Adams Biography Wing</li><li>Deep thought dialogue tree</li><li>Moving around the museum and Dialogue Tree for Marvin</li><li>Wax museum models (lots of help needed here)</li><li>Proper coloring for every model</li><li>Write at least 50 more p.a. announcements</li><li>Missing or bad models for the Last Chance to See Gallery and Stats</li><li>Credits Gallery</li><li>Easter eggs</li><li>Overarching \"game puzzle\" of trying to fix parts of the museum and having some \"plot\" of some kind</li></ol>\n\n<p>That was alot... Anyways happy hitchhiking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T14:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f59ed256b77f232206f6d3957e37734f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["siefens.robot.emporium"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
