{"id": 529452, "slug": "the-new-music-of-the-spheres", "name": "The new music of the spheres", "name_original": "The new music of the spheres", "description": "<p>Please note: this is a game art work by artist Lino Strangis made publicly available especially for the Maker Art Fair (Rome 2020)</p>\n<p>A place in virtual reality where the ancient myth of the music of the spheres is revisited in conception and structure, proposing itself as an interactive experience in real time for the whole body. Instead of along concentric orbits, the spheres are developed on a horizontal path that the user / player travels, called to touch the spheres with the swords in his hands and then performing an original music by the author Lino Strangis. In this experience we play, move and at the same time we play a music written no longer on a staff but along a three-dimensional and sensitive space. A work that opens up new leads to the concept of game art, a tool that transforms each player into a performer, designed for intelligent entertainment for the masses but also as a scenic device (performance / theater) around which to build original ways of making a scene. It is an operation of reappropriation and radical transformation of the deep sense of one of the most advanced gaming technologies currently available, literally reinvented to become an object of art and at the same time an original instrument not of one but of various artistic languages. To enjoy the work, which can be downloaded for free, you need a type of professional PC headset, but for those who do not own it, you can get an idea of this project through the documentation available here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bb/8bbf16fbe06516a29c2f8b39edd1bbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strangis Realities"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
