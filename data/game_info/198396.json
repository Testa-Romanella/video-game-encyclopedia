Its a mystery game that is all up to your choices. It is a difficult game. A lot of hidden things needed to be found. So it will never get boring. The first three files (Game file and two data files) all need to go into one folder. Then you download the 4th file and complete the setup. It will then allow you to play the RPG game. I hope you enjoy. If there are any further questions Please email me at:</p>wardella123@gmail.com<p>Also go and check out our website. It has the entire Story of the Game.
