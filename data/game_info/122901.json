There are no visuals at all,\u00a0 so players must navigate the world by listening to environmental sounds, feeling their way along walls, and following the sound of music.</p>\n<p>This game is simply about finding your way, and finding music. There are musical instruments hidden throughout the short adventure for you to collect. If you can reach the end, you will hear the instruments you found create a symphony.</p>\n<p>Blind is best experienced with stereo headphones in a quiet environment.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are simple, and should be easy for casual players to pick up.<br/></p>\n<p>As the name implies, Blind is fully playable by players who cannot see.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The entire game (design, programming, sound, music, etc.) was created by Nathan Powless-Lynes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/066b6615440aced99797057b5caef75c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nathan Powless-Lynes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
