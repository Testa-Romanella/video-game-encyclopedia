PICO-8's library is pretty much just\u00a0a sprite renderer, input handler, sound system, and that's it. For a game like Tic tac toe, that works just fine, but for anything more complex than that, like a platformer or puzzle game or whatever, I don't think I'm at the point where I could comfortably code those. For people who are more seasoned game developers, I think you should disregard this point, because you're probably at the skill level where you could reasonably create those games.</li><li>This is a small one, more of a nitpick than an actual flaw, but to navigate in pico-8 you have to use right-click instead of left-click.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e594fd5eb80da5463e602ef7478b231f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["michaelmakesgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
