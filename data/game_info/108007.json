Three Overlords command the armies of the Undead, the Soulless and the Foul, and when the war is over, the Land will be shrouded in eternal frost and night.</p><p>To prevent that, Three Heroes were chosen according to the stars and the signs on the sky. They were offered three gifts, which they gladly accepted: The Bag of The Stork that was used to bring the world from its place of birth and may contain anything and everything, the Telltale Map that remembers everything it sees and hears, and the Eye of Banishment that will send any corrupt soul within its sight to the voids beyond creation.</p><p>The task for the Three Heroes is not an easy one, and they will need all the help they can muster in finding out who the Overlords are, and by what means they may be defeated.</p><p>Everything is done by left-clicking on the menu, icons and location graphics. When the cursor hovers above an icon or a hotspot, a pop-up window appears in the top of the screen naming the object beneath. Clicking it will focus that object, usually opening up the menu with any possible interaction. </p><p>Unless the game requires you to select something (ie during the battle when orders are given to your party members), you can cancel an action by using the \"Close\" option in the menu. </p><p>To cancel an action or selection when chosing from a list of icons (ie casting a spell, targetting an attack or a spell...) click on any empty space in the screen.</p><p>Towers of Twilight homepage &amp; full instructions<br/></p><p>sinister systems on Patreon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805132fc1956cc436eae85d402e8387a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["charon@ss"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
