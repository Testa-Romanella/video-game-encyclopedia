Each team will take rounds in guessing words. At the beginning of each round there will be a YouTube video being played for a short bit. Once this is finished the current team has to guess which 2 words were used to search for this video! Guess one wrong and the turn will pass to the next team. First team to guess all 6 key words belonging to their team wins!<br/></p>\n<p>At the end of the game you will see a short history to see just how bad (or good) you were in guessing.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b66a67f228359ab49ac60240ca628bb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AncientGrave"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
