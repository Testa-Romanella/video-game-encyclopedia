Your food supplies are running low, and a pack of predatory aliens have your scent. You&#39;re out of bullets for your pistol, your only weapon a handful of rocks. A freezing night is setting in, and you are desperately looking for firewood. Can you survive?<br />\nScavenge enough food and supplies to survive through the cold, dark nights.<br />\nExplore the alien ruins and bases to find parts for weapons and equipment.<br />\nShoot, sneak, and think quickly. Lure the aliens to fight the marines.<br />\nChoose from four playable characters, each with different strategies and abilities.<br />\nNotrium has six possible endings, but can you reach any of them?<br />\nNotrium was originally released in 2003 when it was regarded as one of the finest examples of the budding indie game movement.
