I've stopped working on it in years past, and unfortunately lost the original source code just last year. I'm keeping this page published for posterity.

Collect orbs and defend your home base to reach the score limit before the other team!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Up to 16 players and 4 teams!</li><li>6 different weapon types that open up many different playable strategies!</li><li>Computer-controlled AI that can be added to any game, online or off!</li><li>Direct-connect to a server IP or scan for games on your network!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Players begin in opposite corners of the map, near their home base.</li><li>Collecting white orbs and bringing them back to home base increases your team's scoring rate. The more orbs you have, the faster you gain points.</li><li>Collecting dark \"energy\" orbs increases your energy levels. When energy is low, your speed is reduced.
