If you see a \"laggy\" comment feel free to ask them if they've ready the suggestion at the top of this instructions panel ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>- No, it's not counting wrong on the third lap of Pure Racing. You're likely to be lapping the slower cars!\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Yes, collision can be a bit ropey so you might go\u00a0through a few objects at full speed. I'll probably maybe fix that some time soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I'll delete any ads in the comments. - It's worth looking at the comment in the \"to do\" sprite in the project before making suggestions. They may already be on my list!\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I'll probably save most of the improvements I want to make (such as improved turning, drifting, better AI, more scenery, etc.) for Racy Brum Brum 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well done if you've read this far! For your interest, tapping '1' during any race will toggle the frame counter and detail settings. The game attempts to maintain 30 frames per second by adjusting rendering quality on the fly. It's quite interesting watching it try to keep the best detail settings that it can! I'd be interested to hear how it's performing on other computers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still here? Want to activate the Easter Egg?\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Follow RokCoder (just because...)\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) Go to the options screen\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) Hover over the back button\u00a0</p>\n<p>4) Type the name of your favourite Scratcher ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>5) Leave an unexplained comment saying \"I love Easter eggs!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still here??
