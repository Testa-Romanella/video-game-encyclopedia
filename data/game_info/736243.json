Its story borrows from multiple scenarios from the entire Battle Network saga. Several Touhou characters are put in the roles of some of the original Battle Network characters.</p>\n<p>The original developer got a C&amp;D from Capcom and shut everything down, just before it was completed but its leaked source code was built upon and translated to English. The game has a ending, but doesn&#39;t have 100% of what was planned to had, so a group of anonymous volunteers is trying to add it to the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2022-02-09T03:32:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d1b488928bb329425fd10e448a57e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
