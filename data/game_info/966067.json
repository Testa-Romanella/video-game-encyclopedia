{"id": 966067, "slug": "a-lively-haunt", "name": "A Lively Haunt", "name_original": "A Lively Haunt", "description": "Stranded on the roadside when your car breaks down, you quickly begin to realize that a faulty engine is the least of your troubles. You find yourself surrounded by malicious assailants with strange, seemingly supernatural, properties. And when you take shelter in a nearby estate, things only seem to get worse, as you begin to suspect an ominous connection between the historic property, and the grim, relentless revenants.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>One or Two Players:</strong> Full game can be played solo, or with a friend (local co-op only, 2 keyboards required).<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Hopelessly Nostalgic:</strong> Heavily inspired by adventure games of the mid to late 1980s. Haunt meticulously re-creates the visual style, audio design, and gameplay mechanics reminiscent of the time.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Outdated Text Parser Interface:</strong> A \"point &amp; click\" adventure, without all the bother of having to point or click. Type in commands such as \"OPEN DOOR\" or \"TAKE CROWBAR\" to solve dozens of challenging, but organically integrated, puzzles.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Improves Typing Speed:</strong> Presumably. Practice your typing skills as you play. Be the envy of all your friends.</li></ul><br/><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong><br/>Multiplayer supports 2-player, local \"couch\" co-op only, and both players are required to have their own, separate keyboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T05:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d056ba369cc4a687fc0d1d652227772f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin McConnell"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
