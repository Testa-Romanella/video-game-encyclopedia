I made a game about finding game boy games!\u00a0 The game itself is REALLY short, but almost everything except the couches are interact-able.\u00a0 For my first completed jam/game, I don't think it came out too bad!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard controls: arrow keys for movement.\u00a0 Z is interact. X is cancel/go back. enter is start<br/>Joy-pad controls: D-pad is movement.\u00a0 A is select, B is cancel. Start is start</p>\n<p>Note: I have trouble using a joy-pad.\u00a0 It seems that the keys are weird.\u00a0 YMMV.</p>\n<p>if you hit start, you have to hit cancel (z or b) to exit the menu.\u00a0 Hitting start again will open the menu in the menu, making you have to hit B TWICE, and so on.
