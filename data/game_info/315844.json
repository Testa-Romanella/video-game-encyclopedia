You'll want to use the ships you control to sell items and\u00a0collect different currencies from different sources to generate <em>doubloons</em>.</li><li>Be wary of how much of one currency you accumulate and of how much doubloons you spend, since if your <em>doubloons</em> lose their dominant status on the ship, the curse will lift and you will lose the ship.</li><li>There is no randomization, all prices are dynamically calculated under static relationships based on competing demands. Try to speculate on various offers of the sea to maximize profit.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T12:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417db9b5b4962c114df0cd00cf67a858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Matthew Lawrence"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
