The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure's Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a925b6529d68f7ffdc55d2c1fcc8662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Takumi"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Capcom", "Virgin Interactive", "Japan"], "esrb_rating": null}
