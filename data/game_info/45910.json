In Epic Tavern, you build the destiny of your world, one drink at a time. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The Adventurers: A multitude of characters drawn from 20+ classes and walks of life will visit your tavern. Mages, warriors, assassins, and more will be at your disposal! Befriend them over drinks and learn their secrets. Between quests, take their experience, level them up, and influence the nature of their destiny.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The World: You will send your new friends on quests to explore the land of Beor.
