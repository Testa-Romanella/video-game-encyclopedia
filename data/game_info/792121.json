Went using it, we really feel thatthe author put a tremendous effort while creating it.\r\nSome specific Pico 8 features (ADD() DELL() ALL() ...) really makes the difference, theexperience is very immersive,\r\nand when using the BBS store througt SPLORE, we really feel like we are using a game console connected to internet. I'm not much into design or graphics, so the small screen size (128x128) made easy for me to craft something relatively descent.\r\nAt anytime where I have the choice, I'll certainly prefer prototyping with the Pico 8 virtual machine.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:00:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2be44a5c72bfc6c640cacb541c92996.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sesso Kosga"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
