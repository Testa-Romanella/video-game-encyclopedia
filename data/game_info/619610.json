Armed with a spear, you must fight off zombies to survive. The catch? The King of the Zombies, the King Zombie, has implanted his tongue into your skull, linking you both together and\u00a0limiting your movement. To make his grasp weaker,\u00a0 you must kill zombies and pick up their hearts, which contain blood.\u00a0Be quick-the longer the zombie has been alive, the less blood their heart has.\u00a0Killing zombies also gives money, which can be used to buy upgrades in the pause menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a blast to make and I would totally do it again! Obviously there are bugs, let me know if you find any in the comments.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>-A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6605a8d1259cca245958b7848eca7e4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adwit Satyawadi"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
