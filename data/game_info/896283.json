{"id": 896283, "slug": "robus", "name": "Robus", "name_original": "Robus", "description": "<p>A product of Futuregames 2022 Team 2\u2019s Game Project 1 \r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Robus is a frantic bus driving game about picking up robots at bus stops and taking them to their destination without running out of energy. Each robot passenger can affect how your bus drives so you better be prepared to not to lose control!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game was created during a two-week sprint by a development team consisting of 1 programmer, 2 artists, 5 designers and 1 QA. This was the first game project for the year.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Our goal with this game was to meet the theme of the exhibition that Tekniska Museum in Stockholm, Sweden tasked us with. The theme given to us was \u201cfuture transportation\u201d and was meant to be a part of their \u201cZero City\u201d exhibition. Our target audience was made up of 10-12 year olds and Robus was playable at booths at the museum.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Our main inspirations behind Robus were games like Crazy Taxi and The Simpsons: Road Rage. We wanted to take a unique approach and used an energy meter to be more in line with the theme, and added driving modifiers to add a twist to give the game more replayability. \r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This project taught us the importance of communication, development planning, and adaptability when it comes to scope and feature creep. Working under such a short time frame really brings the most important aspects of game development to the top and we will take these learnings forward into our future games! <br/></p>\n\n<p>Programmer: Sachit Hedge</p>\n<p>Artists: Klara Pranke, Natasha Mezheven</p>\n<p>Designers: Douglas T\u00f6rn-Persson, Jorge Cobacho, Lisen Skogman, Samantha Davis, Seth Marrison</p>\n<p>QA: Victor Altamirano<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cad93ed9c67dc5124b15f5fcbc47bce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames", "Samantha Davis", "LisenS", "Sekama", "DougTP", "Jhcob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
