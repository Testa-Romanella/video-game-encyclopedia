Its vaguely based off Plants Vs Zombies, but is completely different :)</p>\n<p>All you have to do is drag and drop the cards on the people to make them disappear, Sounds easy but is it really?\u00a0This 2D card game has four levels, ranging from easy to very hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Its still in development so if there are any bugs (or spelling mistakes), I'm working on it. It is a fully functional game though, and also really fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the future I want to add\u00a0more levels to the game,\u00a0special cards, which will slow down the people, or damage all the heath, and possibly add sound. I would also like to add a difficulty setting, and an endless timed version with a leader board. But for now...</p>\n<p>ENJOY</p>\n<p>\u00a0(It works best with a 16:9 ratio screen)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T06:54:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8b/f8b1c8dc65dc4b29791d21a708019b39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sophielynch221"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
