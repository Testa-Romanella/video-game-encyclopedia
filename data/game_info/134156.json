Using a bolt of electricity, the player can jump up and hover. In addition to gaining height, the bolt charges the ground directly below.\u00a0<br/><br/>Increasing the charge allows for a number of things, firstly the player can hover higher (allowing larger foes to be attacked from above), secondly enemies are slowed down, and thirdly it unlocks the zapper gun.<br/><br/>Both the zapper gun and downwards bolt can be used to either charge ground or damage enemies. They can also be used interchangeably to gain more power when pointed at the central battery, however this risks depleting the battery entirely, losing the game. *Tip* It is more efficient to charge the ground using your hover bolt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc2be7cd553bf21fc786df1c5bd5ce58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Alex"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
