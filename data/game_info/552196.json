The treasures values and weight can be checked in the trophies room. THANKS.</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You impersonate a greedy thief\u00a0 frog who is trying to steal as much\u00a0\u00a0treasures as he can from the castle. But since he is little, the more he takes, the harder it is to move around.</p>\n<p>You will have to hide from the fierceful guards who will pursue you if they see or hear you wandering around. You will have to sneak around so the snakes don't find you and most of all... do not wake the Queen!</p>\n<p>Will you manage to get all the trophies?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MECHANICS</strong></p>\n<p>- Explore the castle to find all the trophies<br/></p>\n<p>- The more weight you carry, the slower you will go</p>\n<p>- If you run, the guards will here you from further distance</p>\n<p>- You can throw the carried trophies away to run faster, but the snakes will catch them and you will lose them forever<br/></p>\n<p>- Use your tongue to get the trophies you can't reach</p>\n<p>- Once you have the score that you need, you will have to get out without being caught</p>\n\n<p><strong>THEME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Less is more - this game was entirely made for the\u00a0Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3 (https://itch.io/jam/blackthornprod-game-jam-3). The topic of the jam was \"Less is More\". For our team, this game is a perfect example of this topic since the more you carry, the harder it is to get out alive (with forcess you to grab\u00a0a\u00a0<strong>less\u00a0</strong><strong>amount\u00a0</strong>of treasures, but finding greater values). All the art, music and source was made from scratch for this jam.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TEAM, CREDITS AND CONTACT</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sergio Woodprint (IG: @sergio_woodprint) - Artist</p>\n<p>David Chico (IG:\u00a0@_davidchico) - Programmer and Artist</p>\n<p>David Lled\u00f3 (IG:\u00a0@againdav)\u00a0- Programmer</p>\n<p>Alberto Raya (IG:\u00a0@albertorayamusic)\u00a0-\u00a0Soundtrack composer and Sound effects</p>\n<p>The font of the game is taken from\u00a0https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/spooky-cat</p>\n\n<p><strong>THANKS!\u00a0</strong>We hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3a/d3aef915cbc6b2c4d6f9d5b7a5ef3ee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MeTuS12"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
