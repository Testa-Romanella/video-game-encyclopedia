Point + Click with mouse to fire.</p><p>Defend the Prysum from the Gruns alongside other players - but each player is trapped in their own planar slice! You can't join your compatriots in their slice of the battlefield, so keep an eye on the minimap to coordinate!</p><p>Shooting an enemy from a different plane (denoted by hue) will deal only partial damage, so try to focus your fire on the targets that match your character.</p><p><strong>NOTE: to host you will need to forward port 7777 on your router to host the game. You can play alone without internet by hosting.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d1/4d1fb932d4f0fbdb23da6bd542b95742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BossChamber"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
