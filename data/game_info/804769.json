Simulation driving allows the experimenter to drive in a virtual driving environment,<br/>\r\nMake them feel the visual, auditory and somatosensory car driving experience close to the real effect. The driving simulation effect is lifelike, energy-saving, safe and economical, and is not limited by time, climate and site,<br/>\r\nThe advantages of high driving training efficiency and short training cycle are widely used in new model development and driving training. \"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T07:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/3289db27ea0a4118d2b588974ec1f136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6a21\u62df\u9a7e\u8003\u4e8c"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u6a21\u62df\u9a7e\u8003\u4e8c"], "esrb_rating": null}
