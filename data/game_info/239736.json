Galaxian was developed and released in 1979. It was designed to build and improve upon the formula of Taito's game SpaceInvaders. Though not nearly as successful as Invaders had been, Galaxian became one of the most profitable games of its time. It has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of the game in a tiny download package. <br/>And now you too can relive the action - shoot waves of alien space ships to earn high score. Count your shots - the more you shoot, the more they shoot back. Tilt the phone to control defender ship. <br/><br/>Don't forget to check our Games section for more fun games...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8d7619acca976d6e9e57be9cc978be.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
