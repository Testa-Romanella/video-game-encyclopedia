Now with Grandpa Manager, you can find out right now! Manage your team of slackers and disappointments through a series of bizarre events with a dark sense of humor. When they succeed, your Pride increases! But when they fail, your Pride begins to fall. A few wrong movies and Insanity might just push you to do somethings outside of your control...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGet Your Family Through the Years!\r\n<p>When your family members don't have the brains to make their own decisions through the years, you are there to guide them. Plan for upcoming events and roll with the day-to-day punches to make sure that your family makes it to the end of the year in one piece.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGuide Your Family\r\n<p>As we all know, this newest generation of young upstarts don't know how to do anything right. Use your superior elderly knowledge to pick priorities for them and guide them down the path to success!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSell Your Family!\r\n<p>Tired of your youngest being nothing but a complete disappoint who can't even tie their own shoes at the age of 10? In Grandpa Manager, you can simply trade away your failure of an offspring for a newer and better one! Throw in some of that sweet, sweet Social Security money to soften the deal and you'll have a team of shoe-tie-ers in no time!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nConquer the Grandpa League!\r\n<p>The grandpas in this town mean serious business. The only thing that matters here is Pride and you, as the new fart in town, have none of it.
