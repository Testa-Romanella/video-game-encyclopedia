Beat 46 levels and the final boss on 47th.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Use the Controller or virtual analog stick with the mouse ( or touch on mobile devices ) to control the bird.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"It's like driving a bird\", a comment by a friend of mine</p>\n\n<p>Different lamps have different properties. The red one attracts you, and the purple one repels you. Reach the green lamps to finish the levels. Yellow ones are your friends, stop and rest near them; they replenish your health. You can ONLY stop the bird near yellow lamps and nowhere else.</p>\n<p>You will encounter some bulb-like structures. You need to find misplaced yellow orbs and place them back into the bulbs to make them glow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will find flesh-eating plants, hungry butterflies, angry bees, rope crawling worms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>and yeah! watch out for the dragon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T14:47:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da2603305f83b6cdf5826c04f0a26416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["redsnowdev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
