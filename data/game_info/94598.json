Unfortunately for you, he's decided to practice his stunts directly over your farm. Grab a few friends and use your \r\n\t<strong>flippers</strong> to keep him away from your <strong>chickens</strong>! If Ant scares all your chickens off your barn, it's curtains for you!<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was made in the space of about a week and a half, in honour of a friend's birthday. I am probably finished with it but may go back and add support for touch devices if there's demand for it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, you can find me on twitter at @synth_ruiner!</p>\r\nDefault controls\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlippers: Left Ctrl, Space, Right Ctrl, Numpad Enter\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tP to pause, R to reset, Esc to quit\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e1516987195d2660482bd4fb05979bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ruin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
