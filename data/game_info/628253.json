We had the freedom to create any type of\u00a0project using Three JS. The members of this were really inspired by aesthetically pleasing projects and some good tunes, so this is what we came up with, a simple, high-quality band on a stage playing in a winter park during a sunset.</p>\n<p>The project includes a custom GUI that is fully interactable, with 3 custom audio tracks of each instrument. Playing around with this will change the size of the instrument depending on the audio level. The post processing/lighting effects are also impacted by the presence of the instruments!</p>\n<p>This project may take a while to load for the first time as all the assets/audio renders in properly. Thank you for your understanding!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T07:14:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92bf818afa828cdff08608af349456d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Garnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
