Content may change and the eventual public release may vary depending on feedback.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's been a few months since Serena, Rosalyn and Meg befriended the game genie Mughara and the group is now enjoying a nice vacation at the beach.\r\n</p>\n<p>And what beach vacation is complete without some magical watermelon splatting?\r\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately an old mischievous friend is very eager to turn their innocent game into a dangerous adventure that will see the girls running, jumping and fighting watermelon monsters and cute towering bosses as they travel the beach to recover something very important to them.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022Fight and explore the sand stages by switching between the girls. Run, jump and homing attack against the enemies with Meg, dash on turbo with Rosalyn's trusted friend/floater, Nugget, and shoot bubbles from safety with Serena.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022Explore sand stages that range from a city to an ancient temple, and destroy the hidden watermelons to recover the titular fragments. Be careful, however, as cute, yet dangerous, towering bosses are ready to stop you!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022The demo contains the intro and the first two stages of the game. More stages and extra challenges are planned for the full game and some early content is already available to my supporters on Patreon .</p>\r\nLinks:\u00a0Patreon,\u00a0 \u00a0Kofi,\u00a0 \u00a0Twitter\r\nOther Crystal Wish Games:\r\n\u00a0Classroom Dungeon (3D RPG)\r\n\u00a0Candy Chase (Lite Horror)\r\nDwindle Hearts (Classic Cards)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8e2e534abe15999f650617e35407bfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XryEcho"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
