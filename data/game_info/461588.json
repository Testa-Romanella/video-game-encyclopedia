Fend off subway-dwelling monsters with your trusty, crystal-powered weapon. An endless shoot-'em-up where you break crystals to get new weapon types and use them to fight back the rock-monster hordes.<br/></p>\n<p>Updates pending very soon! Had a lot of fun making this (especially since I got to bring in some of my nerdiness for rocks and minerals) and I can't wait to polish it even more.</p>\n<p>(Update: Fixed some minor issues with both the game and the download process / zip file. Update 2: Fixed the thing where there were two zip files to download. Update 3: You can play it in ya browser now!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589009d356aec70c5261558a000483c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SporkWizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
