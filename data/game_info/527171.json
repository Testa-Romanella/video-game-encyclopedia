On the Normal mode you have 10 minutes (600 seconds) to travel through different\u00a0<em>Moons</em>\u00a0in order to get a\u00a0<em>shot</em>\u00a0at saving the Earth (hehe get it?), or you could say that acquiring 100.000$ in 10 minutes is a\u00a0<em>Moonshot</em>. Ok I'll stop.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling spicy, try the Hard mode where the time limit is reduced to 3 minutes. Be mindful of your fuel level, don't get hit by enemies and use bombs strategically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T10:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7e1217f3a3ef18d251c3ec179e664ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mimikatz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
