Much thanks to itch.io for building this platform and giving me an external deadline!<br/></p>\n<p>Tetruss is a Tetris clone built as\u00a0a\u00a0web app.\u00a0The code is\u00a0open-source\u00a0on\u00a0github here. The logic and rendering was done with ClojureScript (cljs), reagent, re-frame, and shadow-cljs. The\u00a0look and\u00a0feel\u00a0is owed largely (completely) to\u00a0NES.css, a component\u00a0library that\u00a0emulates the\u00a0style\u00a0of\u00a0NES\u00a0games.</p>\n<p>The game logic itself is basic Tetris, with some exceptions. For example, the scoring, I did on my own, because I was excited to solve that, and I hadn't yet found the Tetris Wiki. Did you know there's a Tetris wiki? I'll have to explore the whole thing to see what other differences there are. If you're looking for more, there's even a big list of Tetris fan games.<br/></p>\n<p> My memories of Tetris include playing it on an old computer while staying out of my bosses' way during a college internship, and some amount of battle Tetris with my siblings. Share some of your own below!<br/></p>\n<p>I originally set out to build a Mean-Bean Machine clone, as that is much more nostalgic for me. Then my plan wandered toward some other falling-block puzzle game.... I\u00a0decided to stick to the classic for now to cut down on decision fatigue and paralysis by analysis. Now I've Finally Finished Something! If you were hoping for Mean-Bean Machine, I hope to have an engine like that done by next Sunday for the Winter 2020 My First Game Jam.</p>\n<p>This game is feature-minimal - no saving/sharing of high scores, no battle mode, controls cannot yet be customized. I'm open to feature requests, ideas, and variants! If there's anything you've always wanted to see in Tetris, or just fleeting ideas, feel free to share!</p>\n<p>Every time I hear about someone playing, I get a warm fuzzy feeling inside :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/551c92554c97c729a5857776d69541dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["russmatney"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
