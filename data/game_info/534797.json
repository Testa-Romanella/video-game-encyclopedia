But, definitely not without the help of Kilo - his lovable and loyal three-eyed kitty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When catastrophic events led to nuclear winter in the once green and bright continent of Essence this unlikely pair found each other in ruin. They found shelter, comforted each other, shared food and healed. Through all that, Kilo and Tunn formed a bond like no other, becoming the best of friends! If Tunn ventures too far, Kilo cant help but cry for him. And without Kilo, Tunn wouldn't have the cuddliest companion to keep him warm as he drifts off to sleep all the while fantasizing about how one day, Essence would return to the vibrant and cheerful place it was.</p>\n<p>Follow these two on one of their treks and venture into the unknown as you push, dig, hiss, and jump your way to your next adventure!<br/><br/>Kilo and Tunn has been a passion project for a group of coworkers who decided to join a game jam. After our normal work days, creativity, passion and drive unfurled into something we are extremely proud of.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Credits:<br/>Story: Jeremy Sax, Josh Vrinten, Scott Moniz<br/>Level Design: Jason Dahl, Jeremy Sax, Josh Vrinten, Scott Moniz<br/>Artwork and Animation: Autumn Rayne, Dew Smith<br/>Music &amp; Sound: Jeremy Sax, Autumn Rayne<br/>Programming: Jason Dahl, Raul Chedrese, Scott Moniz<br/>Concept: Autumn Rayne, Dew Smith, Jason Dahl, Jeremy Sax,\u00a0<br/>Josh Vrinten, Marcelo Blaz, Raul Chedrese, Scott Moniz</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to our testers: Alvin Acatyn, Christian Klein, Myar Nasr,\u00a0<br/>Peter Sax, Ryan Hoppe, Nic Nibbs, Nicole Raquinio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4bdfd994bc49cecece7c6c7191f49fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JuiceBox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
