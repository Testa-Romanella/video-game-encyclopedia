I believe the simplicity of birds flying across your screen, to the texts in the poster bobbing according to your mouse movement, overall gives a nice and pleasing experience. As someone who has never used or done something like p5.js, it was a technical challenge for me to start out on this project. However, as I learned more interesting ways to program and improve on my poster, I believe I achieved personal success of creating a interactive experience I enjoy myself. If I had more knowledge in p5.js, I would have added additional interactive elements like changing the color of texts when the user hovers them and etc.</p>\r\nCredits<p>Diamonds and Pearls - Dezaulait.\uc0ac\ub791</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/dezaulait/diamonds-and-pearls<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f8d71530dbe1881883315378c93760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dshim1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
