I'm intending to release it for mobile.</p>\n\n<p>You have a set of knights. They want to return to their kingdom.</p>\n<p>To do that, you move them through a grid.</p>\n<p>However, the knights are very territorial. They occupy whatever square they stand on.</p>\n<p>Your job is to make sure at the end, when all the knights return to their kingdom, the number of squares belonging to each knight is the same. If not, war would break out.</p>\n<p>Good luck! Hope you are able to Keep The Peace :)</p>\n\n<p>If you have any feedback be sure to leave them in the comments down below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:30:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/64339f445cffe7f59d4a0f3bc3ff4b41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["escapadegames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
