As you know, in a typical RTS you issue global orders \u2014 basically what should be built and how to advance through the technology trees. It is different here. You control your character like you normally would do in a roguelike. Also you issue orders to your followers verbally, participate in fights, you have inventory and equipment. As a result we've got a mix of genres: real-time strategy and a dungeon crawler, two in one.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T12:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da644548fecae9f27fbb9ae827bf46c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 112, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "esrb_rating": null}
