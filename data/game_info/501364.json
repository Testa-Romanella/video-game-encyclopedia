Veganeko Weirdo is the result!</p>\n<p>It was an incredible ride, we learned a lot and thanks to UE4, we were able to put together a fun little puzzle/dexterity game while coming from non technical backgrounds (artist and musician). <br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking it out and feel free to give us feedback if you have the time!</p>\n<p>THE GAME:</p>\n<p>Cats fall in random positions from the top of the screen. You have to turn them around so that they land on their feet at the bottom. The cat will face left or right and you can only turn in that direction. When you win, a new cat spawns, falling slightly faster. You have 9 tries, because where we come from, cats have 9 lives...</p>\n<p>The four difficulties determine the initial falling speed and the increase when you win. There is no time limit, get the highest score possible and unlock all the rewards and collectible cards!<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Turn left and right (left and right arrow)</p>\n<p>Speed up fall (down arrow)<br/></p>\n<p>Quit or Retry (ESC)</p>\n<p>Pause (P)</p>\n<p>THE DOWNLOAD:</p>\n<p>Just extract the .zip and launch the game with Veganeko.exe.</p>\n\n<p>Come on over to our social media!<br/></p>\n<p>V-NA and Riesenradler on Instagram:<br/>https://www.instagram.com/veganekoweirdo/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/riesenradler_music/<br/></p>\n<p>Riesenradler on Bandcamp and Twitter:</p>\n<p>https://riesenradler.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/riesenradler</p>\n<p>Of course... no cats were harmed during the production of this game! :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cc/8cc29eb502b54d0373842b5a929053e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Riesenradler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
