One dreadfully, unfortunate day, all the flowers died<br/>and there wasn\u2019t nearly enough pollen near their home to make a drop<br/>of honey. So, to save all it\u2019s family\u2019s lives, the bravest bee had to<br/>go far away to collect all the pollen it can get. But it is dangerous<br/>out there, as the mosquitos have claimed this far away territory.<br/>What they did not know was that the mosquitos will attack even if the<br/>bee came in peace. The brave bee had to save its family so it went on<br/>the long and dangerous journey.
