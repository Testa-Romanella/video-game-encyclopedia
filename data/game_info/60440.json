This one is about art museums.<br/><br/>In Occupy White Walls, you create your own museum and curate its contents. Construct a space, pack it with pictures that are personal to you, and open its doors to welcome the world!<br/><br/><br/>Occupy White Walls is an MMO, where art is the quest and self-expression the reward. Build your own place from a thousand components. Put art where you want it \u2013 a stately home, a desert, a metro station, in the void of outer space \u2013 or all of the above, it\u2019s for you to decide. This is about creation, not destruction. Create something beautiful and show it to the world! <br/><br/><br/>There\u2019s a galaxy of amazing art out there that you don\u2019t yet know you\u2019ll love. To help you find it, is DAISY, our sweet AI, who can suggest what you might like from observing what you do like.<br/>Some people just aren\u2019t moved by most museums. Maybe you\u2019re one of them? That\u2019s fine! All it means is that the art you see there is wrong for you. DAISY will try find something right. If you like it, hey, take it. Hang it in your virtual gallery. Don\u2019t let others tell you what to like. Like what you like.<br/><br/><br/>Art is meant to be experienced with others. If it doesn\u2019t invite conversation, than what\u2019s the point? Because of this, social interaction with this central to Occupy Whitewalls. Why do you like that painting? What do you think of this one? Why did you put those two next to each other?<br/><br/>Make friends with strangers, or be a stranger to others, whatever works best for you. Inspire, be inspired, be inquisitive. Speak your heart through art!<br/><br/><br/>Every artist deserves an opportunity to reach their rightful audience, but the art market is failing to deliver. Occupy White Walls won\u2019t. DAISY doesn\u2019t care whether a painting is by Leonardo da Vinci or Leonardo DiCaprio: if she thinks someone might like it, she\u2019ll show it. If you\u2019re an artist, DAISY will present your work to the potentially interested, just as she would anyone else\u2019s, famous or not. The art remains fully owned by you; all DAISY cares about is finding it a following.<br/><br/><br/>Occupy White Walls is a labour of love. We developers feel as if we\u2019ve opened a door to a world we don\u2019t fully understand. We can see that it\u2019s wondrous, awesome and exciting, but we\u2019re still trying to figure out where next to go. We are propelled by your involvement, your ideas and your enthusiasm; we\u2019re always listening, as we explore new ways of playing with art in this beautifully strange and strangely beautiful game.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-31T04:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/676/6760e5aa7bae8d2514302b359799c486.jpg", "website": "https://www.oww.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StikiPixels"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StikiPixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
