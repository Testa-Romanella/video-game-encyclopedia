It was done with one programmer (Myself) and one artist (Lukas Bartee). It was designed as an infinite runner where you play as a thief that has stolen the queen's crown and you are running from the queen's train. You have to jump over obstacles to avoid death and gain points. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>A few quick notes about some problems</strong></p>\n<p>The physics are fairly broken so if the player flies off the screen or something else weird happens you may have to force restart the exe</p>\n<p>Pressing the restart button may seem like it didn't work at first, Give it a second or two and the game will reset<br/></p>\n<p>The restart/ death screen text is incredibly small in the build so here's what it says \"You done goofed it, press r to restart\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Press Space or Left Mouse Click To jump over the obstacles<strong>, </strong>Press r to restart if you have died</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea64880a8a9b0ee3cd5021f4cb526015.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atoxiam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
