Skinner)", "description": "<p>LOMA (Levels Of Many Authors) is an evergrowing set of puzzles started by Aymeric du Peloux. It challenges\u00a0puzzle makers to create levels based around some constraints, including 10 different crate/target configurations.\u00a0 These levels can then be added to the set. You can see the current set and the constraints in detail\u00a0here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of limiting himself to one puzzle per configuration, Skinner made multiples of each, for a total of 40 LOMA puzzles. These are included in Microban III (puzzles 60-100).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's Microban?</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>The\u00a0Microban collection is good for beginners and children. Most of the puzzles are small and illustrate a particular concept.\u00a0More experienced players should also find them interesting, since there is a wide variety and many can be surprisingly tricky at first glance.\r\nMicroban sets\u00a0contain levels of the following types:\r\n1. Small levels which demonstrate one or two concepts.\r\n2. Levels which are easier than most Sasquatch levels.\r\n3. Levels which are smaller and simpler versions of other levels.\r\n4. Large levels which contain only one object. Use the mouse to place the object on its destination, then sit back and watch the computer do all the work. These are I-154, I-155, II-132, II-133, II-134, II-135, III-101, IV-101, IV-102.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>(Taken from D.
