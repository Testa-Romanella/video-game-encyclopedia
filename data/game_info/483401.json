Well, that's not so bad, right? At least they can't cheat... right? It's pure chance... right?</em></p>\n<p><em>But these people play snakes and ladders differently.</em></p>\n<p><em>The board starts with no snakes and no ladders.\u00a0When a player rolls their die, they roll it into an opaque box, and nobody gets to see the result right away. First, they must place a ladder on the board, and their opponent must place a snake.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are some rules for placement: neither end of a snake or ladder can touch either end of another snake or ladder, snakes and\u00a0ladders\u00a0cannot be placed completely horizontally, and snakes\u00a0and ladders cannot exceed a certain length.</em></p>\n<p><em>Once the snake and ladder have been placed, the players can\u00a0view the roll, and the counter is moved\u00a0the appropriate number of places, climbing a ladder or sliding down a snake as normal if it lands on one or the other.</em></p>\n<p><em>The game continues like this until somebody reaches the 100th square - this player is declared the winner.</em></p>\n<p><em>It's a bit strange, but it's simple enough. It's still totally random if you happen to roll a number corresponding to where your opponent placed a snake... right!?</em></p>\n<p><em>You have a bad feeling. Your opponent will cheat, somehow. If you can discover how, maybe you can win. It's a risk, but you decide it's worth taking.</em></p>\n<p>This game was written in Python with Pygame in 48 hours (technically longer - more on that below)\u00a0for the University of Liverpool Game Developers Society's first game jam, in Summer 2020.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Post-Jam Changelog:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Amusingly, I had to make most of these post-jam changes in my last jam, too.
