All changes should be very minor once Early Access is over. The game is basically 99% complete right now in its current state! Currently, all 5 chapters are playable, but we are porting the game to a new engine, so the UI/UX will change, along with some minor things like character and background animations. The Linux version is also currently limited to the first 3 chapters. We hope to leave Early Access as soon as possible (1-3 months).<h3>Made in Michigan.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T06:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c74/c7495ba1fda69556378a514c68d86d03.jpg", "website": "https://edencorp.biz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Emcat Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mangotronics"], "esrb_rating": null}
