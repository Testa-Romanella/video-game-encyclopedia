Content warnings are in effect for transphobia and state violence.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A stay against the order has been enacted as of the time of this game\u2019s release. However, the damage has been done, stoking the fires of transphobic discrimination and violence in Texas and beyond.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As of the time of this publication, there are 24 state bills and counting advocating for discrimination against transgender people, many of them speficially targeting children. Freedom for All Americans keeps an updated tracker of the legislation. We urge you to speak out and/or show support in whichever way you feel most comfortable.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>For more information about what healthcare protocols for transgender children actually entail, we recommend this guide by the Human Rights Campaign.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you wish to donate in support of transgender children and their families in Texas, please consider the following organizations:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Equality Texas\r\n</li><li>Organizaci\u00f3n Latina de Trans en Texas\r\n</li><li>Transgender Education Network of Texas\r\n</li><li>Trans Pride Initiative\r\n</li><li>ACLU of Texas\r\n</li><li>Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Lambda Legal\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Many Texans who support trans rights and other humane causes are unable to do so because of gerrymandering and voting rights suppression.
