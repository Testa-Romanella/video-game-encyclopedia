With this game I wanted to showcase not only my ability for dumping a bunch of code or solving a problem, but also my ability for making games in general, game design, sound design, UX and so on, it doesn't have all the features I wished to implement but I didn't wanted to delay the submission for my test and risk not being considered for the position anymore, rather, I tried to leave as much foundation work as I could to showcase all of that, and, regardless of getting hired of not, be able to have a game I could be proud of, and be able to improve, enhance and finish without it feeling unfinished but rather rough around the edges.</p><p><strong>Test Restrictions</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The Challenge:\u00a0\r\n  <ul><li>Write a program that will play a modified version of Gomoku.\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </li><li>Rules of the game:\r\n  </li><li>The board is a 15x15 grid of squares.\r\n  </li><li>Player pieces are either an \"x\" or an \"o\".\r\n  </li><li>Players take turns placing their pieces on the board.\r\n  </li><li>Pieces can be placed in any open square.\r\n  </li><li>Pieces cannot be moved.\r\n  </li><li>Only one piece is allowed per square.\r\n  </li><li>A player wins when there are 5 (or more) of their pieces in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If the grid is completely filled, and a winner is not declared, then the game is a draw.\r\n  </li></ul><ul><li>X always goes first.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>Your Goal:<ul><li>Create a single player version of the game against an AI player.\r\n  </li><li>The UI is not necessarily an important part of the game, but feel free to spruce it up if you like. Any solution is sufficient as long as you have a way for the player to make a move against the AI and view the state of the board (either console/text based or graphical).\r\n  </li><li>The only requirement for the AI is that it plays a decent game against the player (not just random moves). It doesn't have to be overly complex, it just needs to be fun.</li></ul></li><li>Other Rules:<br/> <ul><li>Please use Unity and C#. </li><li>Please include all code needed to run your program. This includes any package, solution, makefiles, libraries you use to answer to develop the project. </li><li>Feel free to use the internet and any other references. Remember the work must be your own.</li><li>Take as much time as you need to complete this test. Ideally this should take no more than one or two evenings. We cannot continue with the interview process until we have received and reviewed this test.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Navigate the menus with your mouse, use the WASD or Arrow keys to move the cursor, press space-bar to place your piece on the board, be the first player to place 5 pieces in a line to win.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be5b3fbfd71eb4e8be0b3ef186d46842.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Q-ro"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
