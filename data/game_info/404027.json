I couldn't figure out how to begin submitting the game, but it turns out it already had been submitted. In the process of removing some debug stuff and doing a final build the itch clock felt like it jumped ahead 7 minutes instantly and my actual build went up post-deadline, so it should probably be disqualified.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Note for everyone else:</em> I had fun working on the game, it's the first time I've gotten to actually involve my girlfriend in some of the game design, I definitely picked a bad time to have her produce a boatload of assets when she wasn't familiar with the pipeline for getting them all in-game. (This is the shortest game jam I've ever participated in.) Even though the game doesn't have everything I was looking to have in it by today there's a pretty good chance I'll finish it up some time. I haven't slept since Friday when I got the email saying the jam had already started so I'm going to bed now.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources Used:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.dafont.com/typography-times.font</li>\n<li>https://www.dafont.com/smooth-pet.font</li>\n<li>https://www.dafont.com/weekdays-roman-slan.font</li>\n<li>https://www.dafont.com/white-rabbit.font</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/audiosmedia/sounds/170583/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Ligidium/sounds/193831/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/sounds/485115/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Ligidium/sounds/193831/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/sounds/485115/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/audiosmedia/sounds/170583/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/InterfaceML5/sounds/339515/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/deleted_user_7146007/sounds/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/deleted_user_7146007/sounds/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/chebere1001/sounds/153395/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/nickyg11p/sounds/390843/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/simonjsounds/sounds/260001/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/shpira/sounds/414924/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/dansotak/sounds/137696/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Lynx_5969/sounds/422671/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/speedygonzo/sounds/235701/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/DSCreative/sounds/439901/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/helenacm/sounds/232978/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Timmeh515/sounds/413279/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Mickael_Leroi/sounds/402145/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Mickael_Leroi/sounds/402144/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/haulaway/sounds/393807/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/50941/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/j0rd4nkzf/sounds/244259/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Yuval/sounds/205749/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/bbrocer/sounds/382643/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/Anthousai/sounds/447846/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/kikuchiyo/sounds/214187/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/lollosound/sounds/387004/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/arseniiv/sounds/327817/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/kyles/sounds/453336/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/altfuture/sounds/174639/</li>\n<li>https://freesound.org/people/LamaMakesMusic/sounds/403507/</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:45:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf8709e8b59a54437d3ccf588ba56002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EntranceJew"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
