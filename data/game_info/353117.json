A short shooter about\u00a0running around levels and shooting stuff until they bleed to death.</p>\n<p>The more you complete levels the more weapons you'll unlock.</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim and shoot</p>\n<p>Shift - Extend aim</p>\n<p>V - Switch weapons</p>\n<p>ESC - Quit to menu</p>\n<p>R - Reload and Restart level</p>\n<p>This has been a passion project for 7 months, and it's the first ever game I released.\u00a0I wanted to make a game for myself with my own sense of humor and I received enough support from friends to upload it somewhere. Unfortunately recently due to lack of motivation and time progress has slowed down to the point where I barely made changes to it. I planned around 12 levels, plus an endless mode but I'd just like to work on something else or develop even shorter games. This won't mean I won't come back to this in the future though to work on implementing the stuff I wanted. I've learned alot from this and will hopefully be able to put some more of my experience into future games.</p>\n<p>The sprites are \"\"\"\"stylistic\"\"\"\" but I think the contrast between the detailed blood and not-so-detailed characters add a charm to it, plus i just like the look of Gustavio's face. Also includes over 70 accessories and masks, even including some of my friends and some in-jokes.</p>\n<p>I've also worked on the music myself, I don't claim to be the best composer but it'll do for now, I'll also upload the ingame tracks to\u00a0my soundcloud so you can listen to the tunes without all the bloodshed in the background.</p>\n<p>Fun fact this was also made in Construct 2 with over 300 events\u00a0since I'm too stupid to program, and Bloodbath Kavkaz was made with the same engine too, so if anything i consider this game to be a horrifying amalgamation of Enter the Gungeon and Bloodbath Kavkaz.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I sincerely do hope you give it a shot and suggest more stuff, It would mean alot.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks alot</p>\n<p>-StringThing\u00a0(idiot loser, gus\u00a0(yes its a self insert shh))shift l\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f4/1f4d9273d6e2a58ff96eecc6cca540c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StringThing"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
