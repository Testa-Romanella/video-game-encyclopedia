The only thing you miss are some rad mutation super powers! That couldn't be too hard, right? <br/><br/>Join the epic quest of becoming a Teenage Mutant Super Hero. Can you make it until you're out of your teens? <br/><br/>There are many many ways to die and also 7 different endings, if you made it out alive. So feel free to explore and enjoy yourself. <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>There is no ingame tutorial of any sort yet and probably still some bugs and glitches as well as lots of balancing to do. <br/><br/>You have a total of 32 moves (8 years * 4 quarters). After each move, your character might mutate in respect to your current mutation chance. The best way to win is to find a smart way of raising your chance to mutate as fast as possible. <br/><br/>Your IQ determines the actions your character can do. Every action will have an effect on your chance to mutate, your health and your IQ. Try to find a good balance between a high IQ, high life and high chance to mutate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d33ff77900e6ddc898ff5a33ea9153e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team Klaus Klapper"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
