Find the seven golden idols hidden within and uncover the forgotten story of an ancient king gone mad.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dank Tomb\u00a0</strong>is a pay-what-you-want title, which means that if you prefer to play it for free, it's perfectly okay to do so. But I'd really appreciate it a lot if you choose to click the \"support this game\" button above,\u00a0or support my future work on Patreon! To show you how much I appreciate it, there is even an expedition journal with additional Dank Tomb story available for download for those who choose to support the game. Source code is also available for PICO-8 enthusiasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrows</strong> - walk around, <strong>Z/C</strong> - jump, <strong>X/V</strong> - interact/use items.\u00a0<br/><strong>Gamepads are supported</strong> as well, if you prefer to play that way.</p>\n<p>If you're stuck, just exit a room and enter it again - it will reset and let you start fresh.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving your progress:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you'd like to put the game down and return to it later, the game features a special room where you can save your progress. Once you see the \"progress saved\" message, it's safe to close the browser.<br/></p>\n<p>To delete your progress (to get 100% completion on a new playthrough, maybe?), press Escape and select \"delete progress\" from the in-game menu.
