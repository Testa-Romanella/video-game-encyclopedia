{"id": 622950, "slug": "steampunk-timer-alpha-prototype", "name": "Steampunk Timer (Alpha Prototype)", "name_original": "Steampunk Timer (Alpha Prototype)", "description": "<p>Steampunk Timer is a Dilated Time Tactical Action game that combines classic real time strategy with a roguelite progression and reward system. It takes place in a dystopian Victorian-style city dominated by the uncontrolled use of machines with the capacity to fold time.</p>\n\n<p>In the industrial city of Victoria, the wealthy lords of the Manorborn Society possessed technology capable of folding time to enrich themselves indefinitely - until now. Faced with the growing impoverishment of the working class, the Traveling Theater Guild summons its actors to master this technology and give the aristocracy a show they will never forget.</p>\n<p>And what about you? Are you the protagonist or a figurant?<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tactical action with dilated time strategy.</strong>  Make use of your time machine and enter Dilated Time Mode (DTM). It  slows down the time around you so you can choose the best tactic to  ambush your enemies.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Roguelite game system.</strong> Choose up to 6 characters in a  run, select one of the routes generated after each mission and buy the  most suitable improvements for each situation. You will be defeated, but  do not despair. In each new beginning, you will be wiser than before.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Pixel-art style graphics. </strong>Enjoy the pixel-art style of its settings and the fluid animations of its characters, drawn frame by frame, pixel by pixel.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>4 bosses to defeat.</strong> Complex and spectacular battles  that will require preparation and quick reflexes. Too easy? Fight hordes  of enemies guarding secret rooms or face the Infinite Basement  challenge.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>10 charismatic characters with unique abilities.</strong> Choose  the Hunter to make quick ambushes, or the Assault to shoot at medium  range, but don't forget the Scout to collect and distribute resources  among his allies. Combine your characters to create the most fearsome  unit in Victoria City.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>200+ upgrades and equipment to unlock.</strong> Were you  planning to send your actors to the dangerous streets without good  equipment? Get food rations to unlock gear and upgrades that will only  be available during the current run. Also, get scrap metal and repair  the Railway-Theater to unlock equipment which can appear in your next  runs.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>50+ fully destructible scenarios in 15+ different biomes.</strong>  Clear that street. If you choose to go north you will go through that  building; if you go south you will arrive at the port crossing a park.  Choose your route at the end of each mission and contemplate the  beautiful places that Victoria City has prepared for your visual  delight. But do me a favor and don't reduce the city to rubble on your  way, would you kindly?</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>This prototype does not represent the final quality of the game.
