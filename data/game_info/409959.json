Originally started as a GameJam game and continued on to become a playable skate game! You can skate in a very shiny city.<br/><br/>The project is a prototype, and part graphics demo for my skills. Together with some really cool people we managed to get a fun sandboxy-style demo game for you guys to play around in.<br/><br/>We're aware there's bugs and the game level can be glitched! Thats why we got a cool restart button :)<br/><br/>CURRENTLY ONLY FOR WINDOWS.<br/><br/>System specs are not measured, but not too heavy.\u00a0There is a \"low quality\" version inside the game.<br/><br/>Project is currently not in development, as there's no team and the game is too much to build for a single person.<br/><br/>Special thanks :<br/>Marnix Rekkers : Environment art help<br/>Walter Haynes : Programmer to build the gameplay elements.<br/></p>\n<p>Charley van Veldhoven &amp; Merijn Berg\u00e9 : for the music soundtrack</p>\n<p>Christopher van der Kieft : Character model and animations.</p>\n<p>Stephan Rumping : Game logo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/0172f045ab2f7e91cedaf247c8c29088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoolCast"], "genres": ["Sports", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
