Its up to cyberpunk hacktivist, Nano, to infiltrate their laboratory and shutdown their mainframe. Use her terminal visor to hack into and bypass security measures.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInstructions:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Use tab to toggle Nano's visor to type in commands.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Use W, A, S, D to move Nano.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Use Q and E to cycle through multiple access points in range.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHints:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; The green circle is Nano's detection range and health indicator.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Not all nodes that appear in Nano's visor need commands to be typed.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; The game does not pause when Nano has her visor down. Be quick!\r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Some security nodes have multiple layers. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n&gt; Nano's health goes back to full after each room.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n[This is a very early prototype for testing the concept of having a game based around the idea of using terminal commands as the main mechanic.]\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTeam:\r\n\t<br/>\r\nRichard Angel, Sprite work\r\n\t<br/>\r\nDaniel Boisselle, Lead programming\r\n\t<br/>\r\nAlexander Boyd, Sprite work\r\n\t<br/>\r\nKyle Townsley, Sprite work\r\n<br/>\r\nJoshua Valljeio, Sound &amp; music\r\n<br/>\r\nStuart Winslow, assistant programming \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893a48b82c62129e96a56cd011851022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["GhostRavenstorm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
