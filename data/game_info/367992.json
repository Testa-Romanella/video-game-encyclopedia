It's a shame that you have some issues controlling your hands. Lets just hope you can keep it going for a while.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move hand with your mouse.<br/>Use the scrollwheel to move hand up and down.<br/>Hover a pin with your index finger to put it on your finger.<br/>Drop pins back into grenades to defuse them.<br/><br/>Couldn't be simpler, right?</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made as a gift for my brother's birthday in 2018. He had recently finished his military service which inspired this game. <br/></p>\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n<p>Grenades can fly outside the box making it impossible to reach them.<br/></p>\n<p>Occasionally the physics can go a bit wonky and freak out, especially with the hand. Sadly nothing you can do but fail and restart.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T08:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b1956a52c3816d96c0ba65e6249f0b05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Anwilc"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
