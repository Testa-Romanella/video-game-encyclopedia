The next iteration will be focused on linear level design, which is taking me a while to get a hang of but I'm going to do my best to tell a great story in a\u00a0thematic and engaging gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy playing this game as much as I did making it. Your feedback is 100% welcome and encouraged. Please leave a comment below and stay tuned for more games and updates.</p>\n<p>Big thank you to GYPTXVN for providing the soundtrack.
