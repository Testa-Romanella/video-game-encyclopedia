Arcs can transmit a numeric value, edges provide structure, and vertices themselves can have different effects.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind it is currently in alpha-level quality.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5884bfd597ff30ba34dbe7c15d7270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["1011X"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
