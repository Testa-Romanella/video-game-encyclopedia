Take care of these strange plants and you will be rewarded with tasty fruits, flowers and even peace itself.<br/></p>\n<p>How to Play:<br/>Click on the door and pot plants to move to them. Clicking on plants collects their stored resources. Use the upgrade window to improve your plants and gain access to new resources.<br/>If you can't see the stored resources, just click on the plant again to gain them. Inventory panel is at the bottom - hover over to see what you have. WIN by generating peace. (Theres no victory screen, but consider yourself victorious when you can generate the 'Peace' item in your inventory).</p>\n<p>Known bugs: Some seeds may be invisible when you get them. Whenever you hit 'Explore' you WILL always get the next seed in line, so go to the next pot and try to place it. It will work. <br/></p><p><strong>Ben Frye</strong><br/>Programming\u00a0</p><p>https://fryeb.github.io<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Violet Minehan</strong><br/>Art &amp; Music<br/>https://www.linkedin.com/in/violet-minehan-b3a299124/<br/>https://dashicorn.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6b11da3c8343cd6d01fad2ec9ab0c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fryeb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
