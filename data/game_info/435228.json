Based on a dream I had  and also on having lost the most beautiful song I've ever known at 16.  I made everything out of felt and it was fun to use my hands and also to keep returning to the fabric shop to buy tiny colourful felt squares - the owner was very intrigued. I'd go and show her but she's probably forgotten. Thanks to Jon Weasley for the sweetest tunes and ideas!</p>\n<p>&lt;3\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>\n<p>Instructions: <br/></p>\n<p>Click on things!
