Some managed to find shelter in the Hall or Vault, others were left entangled in a Black Hole (Black Hole). The rest, scattered across the sands of the Desert, and among the rest, the Core Mechanics.</p>\n<p>Days are slow, with the Mechanics passing the time with projects, sailing the sands, and repairing their home, The Core. The Mechanics are no stranger to odd phenomena occurring in the desert: esoteric faults, rifts in space-time,\u00a0 cessation of some fundamental law or another. Yet on one day in particular comes an impossibility. A visitor from the Hall.<br/></p>\n<p>Under Maintenance is a kinetic visual novel based on the Core Mechanics team in Blaseball. Knowledge of established lore, both in the Blaseball universe and in the Core Mechanics is not necessary, but will help substantially.</p>\n<p>- Credits -</p>\n<p><em>Writing </em>- Gray</p>\n<p><em>Character, BG Art </em>- WiresAndLight</p>\n<p><em>Music</em> - \"Acoustic Rock Drama\", \"Peaceful Evening\" by  Eric Matyas</p>\n<p><em>Additional music</em> via Dova-Syndrome</p>\n<p><em>Sounds</em>\u00a0via freesound</p>\n<p>Bottles Suljak design by tangyorange_art</p>\n<p>Gridciph by Deric<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/7421345d75b65124a32fc8ab12071d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gray Lofi", "WiresinaBox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
