{"id": 621849, "slug": "pitri", "name": "PITRI", "name_original": "PITRI", "description": "<p><strong>PITRI</strong> is a platformer game about 2 insect-sized characters <em>Joined Together</em> ; Pi (Rhymes with \"Knee\") and Tri (identical to \"Tree\").</p>\n<p>Pi and Tri can jump by pressing the X button (X/V/N in a keyboard) and\u00a0split from eachother by pressing the O button (Z/C/N in a keyboard) which result in controling Pi by herself. Without Tri, Pi is much faster, can jump higher, and can bounce on a yellow shroom much higher, too! But, it comes at the cost of dying 10 seconds from splitting, since Pi Can't live without being\u00a0<em>Joined Together</em> with\u00a0Tri.</p>\n<p>This game has been thought of before 2021's <em><strong>Game Maker's ToolKit's Game Jam</strong></em>, and funny enough, the theme for it perfectly matched the concept of the game! So what better time to make a short \"concept demo\" than now?</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game, and it was made in such a short time for the jam, so pardon any bugs that might come your way.</p>\n<p>Press this text to go to the web version (Mobile Friendly)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T00:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/330709b9cf139fde7970a2ad13faa6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MaJeeDooo0010"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
