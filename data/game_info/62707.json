They make you believe you're improving at the game, when really you're unlocking things that make your in-game character more powerful. Stabby Machine does not lie like this. When you do better than you were before, it's because <strong>you really are doing better!</strong> <br/><br/>Because of this, Stabby Machine is a very difficult game. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Survive for <strong>as long as possible</strong> by collecting batteries, which are dropped by enemies! <br/><br/>Watch out! Your battery power drains <strong>faster and faster</strong> the longer you've been playing. <br/><br/>You must <strong>choose wisely</strong> how many enemies to spawn. Too few and you'll run out of batteries, but too many and you'll be overrun! <br/><br/>Controls: Stabby follows the mouse (alternatively you can use W A S D). <br/>You <strong>MUST GO CLOSE TO</strong> enemies to make them charge, then react quickly to dodge them! <br/>If you succeed, the enemy becomes vulnerable and you can run up to it to <strong>stab it</strong>. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>If you want a difficult open-ended challenge to overcome, then this game is certainly for you!</strong> <br/><br/>If you want to casually enjoy a new experience, this game can give you that too. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> Enjoy! </strong> <br/>No micro-transactions or in-game purchases. <br/>None of that silly come-back-in-two-hours-or-pay-me-money stuff! <br/>This game is designed to simply be fun, and feel rewarding to play. <br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong> Strategy </strong><br/>You choose how many enemies to spawn, and you choose when they charge at you. Different enemies spawn at different times. <br/>This means you have to continuously make a tactical decision: How many of this type of enemy can I handle? <br/><br/><br/><br/>Feel free to write a review, it would help a lil' indie developer out a great deal! <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32a3badee17bc7567a4b0281b63e747e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 106}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Challenge Yourself Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Challenge Yourself Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
