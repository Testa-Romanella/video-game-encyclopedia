It may just be a clone of some other online tron games, but I have things planned to make it different such as new maps to play on, a single player mode that isn't bots (very new developer so I don't know how to do that) and more! I hope you all will enjoy my game and PLEASE give feedback on it. I would love to hear what you guys think! Also everything in this game is made by me, the art and the game. (I'm sorry that I'm not a great artist)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for at least checking me out :)</p>\n<p>NOTE!: THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT MAC AND LINUX. THIS IS A WINDOWS ONLY GAME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU HAVE A WINDOWS COMPUTER. THAT IS ALL.</p>\n<p>UPDATE PLANS</p><p>At the moment, I\u00a0have moved on to bigger and better projects, so Gridlocked is pretty much finished. I am considering making a bug fix patch to optimize the game a loooot more, but we'll see what happens.</p><p>Changelog for\u00a0 Gridlocked v1.2:</p>\n<p>-Added 1 new map (Portals)</p>\n<p>-Added a map selection screen</p>\n<p>-Added a pause menu you can access ingame</p>\n<p>-Temporarily removed the blue box for the scoreboard on the grid map, portals doesn't have one. (This may get changed, honestly I don't know.)</p>\n<p>-Made WASD work on the menu screens</p>\n<p>-Fixed bug which let people pass through the others trails without dying</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Thank you and Enjoy my game!</p>\n<p>If you would like, Check out\u00a0109Dev here.
