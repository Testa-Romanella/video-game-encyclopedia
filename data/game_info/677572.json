The  special feature is that a large part of the game mechanics are based on  randomness. No match will be exactly the same, because the battlefield  and the waves of enemies are generated in each round cause of rules defined by  me. Weather influences, natural events, loot and active boss fights  make sure that you as a player will not get bored.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Besides the classic tower defense, strategy elements like mining resources and research play an important role.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Between battles, passive improvements could be unlocked in the city by  constructing buildings, which allows an individual play style. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The demo includes the first chapter of the game, which is about 15 level and all the content that can be unlocked until then.</strong><br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Campaign with 15 levels</li><li>random map/enemy generator - each level is its own challenge</li><li>classic tower defense with predefined paths and open levels where the player has to build his own path</li><li>Weather and day and night system</li><li>Various towers and buildings with their own tasks and abilities</li><li>19 different enemy types with their own abilities</li><li>Including ground, air and boss enemies</li><li>Gamepad support and freely definable button settings</li><li>you can play the Game in English and in German</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<ol><li>Un-zip the file.</li><li>Open the \".exe\"</li><li>Enjoy...</li></ol>\n\n\n<p><strong>I had the first ideas for Green and Grey in 2009 and have been working on it ever since.

There are things in the game that I can't create myself and therefore have to buy. (Music, translations, etc.) </p>\n<p>Thank you for trying out my game and for your support. I assure you that all donations I receive will only be used for the further development of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T04:42:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31a75d6efd5ec025a761ab0a9cda627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Steguweit"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
