I have a 3 month old baby. I'm back at work full time. And I decided, hey, this would be a great month to do a FULL RPG!! I even joined this jam two weeks late because I was wrapping up a January jam.\u00a0I built half this game one handed because I was holding a sleeping baby.\u00a0I gave up on this game so many times. So if this game is at all playable it's a miracle.</p>\n<p>When I wanted to give up I just told myself not to give up until the deadline. Always keep a glimmer of hope that I can pull through. If I am able to finish this game, there is no reason I can't do anything I put my mind to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6086ebb176f1a395ecbd274e4c9d65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KellyGameDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
