A lone hero sets off in his journey to purify the four crystals of the elements but can he do it before the dark lord arrives to rend the world asunder?</p>\n<p>Eh, probably. Hey, what was my name again?</p>\n<p>You wake up as a clown who's forgotten his name and in a ruined city that you do not remember. The circus you belong to seems to be gone but you find old coworkers scattered across the world. All of whom seem to have forgotten their names as well. Nobody knows who they are and where they're going but as long as you're together, you can...go places? Find each other again? Rebuild your circus? I don't know, the whole world saving thing going on is a bit over my head. I'm sure you'll find something to do in this world.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/57986f3047614d7779775740c27a4486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rulerofruins"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
