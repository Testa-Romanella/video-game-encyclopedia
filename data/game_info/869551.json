When you're done, you can press escape to unlock the mouse and exit the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>The MacOS build is buggy. There are small artifacts around the point lights in the game. This is due to an issue with the Godot 4 Beta Vulkan Renderer on MacOS. I will update it as soon as it's fixed. However, I recommend avoiding the MacOS build for now, if possible. The bug should not impact the gameplay, but the graphical glitches might get bothersome or cause flickering.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T16:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c83e2737cddaff38f3d0a85a45b907b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["General Red"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
