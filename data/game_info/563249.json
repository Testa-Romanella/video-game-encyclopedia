Use the mouse to aim the shield and WASD to move around. Bounce the bullets back at the enemies to kill them. Enemies that fire bullets must be killed for the door to open.</p>\n<p>The game records your time and tells you how fast you were at the end.</p>\n<p>For now only a Windows executable exists. I will post an HTML5 build sometime down the line.</p>\n<p><strong>GRAPHICS USED:</strong></p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/8x8-1bit-roguelike-tiles-bitmap-font</p>\n<p>Sprites: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack</p><p>Big thanks to them for the assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a23c124fcff0908286c0713971e6fd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShortenedName"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
