Leaves fall, and spirits rise from the fallen leaves to begin their journey home. You must guide them, without direct control, by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions - build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it&amp;#39;s up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal. <br/><br/><br/>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6 REVIEWS \u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Striking art and innovative gameplay&amp;quot; <br/>\u2013The Escapist <br/><br/>&amp;quot;When the wind physics start to do their thing, the experience is pretty magical.&amp;quot; <br/>\u2013Mike Schramm, tuaw.com <br/><br/>&amp;quot;Spirits is clever, challenging, and beautiful&amp;quot;  <br/>\u2013Gamasutra <br/><br/>&amp;quot;There are a number of titles out there that really ooze that special &amp;#39;indie magic&amp;#39;, and Spirits is one of them.&amp;quot; <br/>\u2013TouchArcade <br/><br/>&amp;quot;Spirits is an outstanding blend of puzzle and strategy&amp;quot; <br/>\u2013DIYgamer <br/><br/>&amp;quot;Gorgeous visuals; ambient music; solid level design&amp;quot; <br/>\u2013Slide To Play <br/><br/>&amp;quot;Spirits is more than just a pretty face, as you&amp;#39;ll utilize little creatures to build ladders, dig tunnels, or blow gusts of wind to get their counterparts to an exit.
