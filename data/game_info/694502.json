This is the first game jam I've done in a while, so even though this game isn't the best, I'm proud I\u00a0pulled it off.</p><p>You can read more about antimatter here (yes, it's real).</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me within the 3 hour time frame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e81e9b71d361fcf1a823a00d241b1cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NotEuclid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
