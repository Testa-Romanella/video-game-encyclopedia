Part of their charm comes with how relatable they are: like many of us, they create monogamous partnerships and raise families in cozy homes that they work hard to build. It is this industrious nature that beavers are better known for. There's a good reason why \"beavering away\" or\u00a0\"busy as a beaver\" are common sayings to describe working hard. Beavers diligently work from dusk til dawn to chomp through trees\u00a0and build their dams and lodges. In many ways, beavers embody the wholesome values of the\u00a0classic American Dream: work hard and raise a family in a home you bought (or built) yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, the history of beavers has not been an idyllic analogy. Beavers were almost hunted to extinction in the 1800s for food\u00a0and clothing. Nowadays, conservation efforts have brought beaver populations back up to healthy levels, but they still face threats from deforestation and lack of water flow from climate change. Beavers can't build lodges if there are no trees to build them with,\u00a0or if there is no water to dam in the first place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beavers greatly aid in combating climate change and benefit the forest ecosystem. Beavers build dams to create ponds of still water\u00a0so that they can construct the lodge that they actually live in without any problems. These ponds\u00a0often spreads to become wetlands, and supports incredible biodiversity. Animals like frogs,\u00a0salmon, and ducks, among others, are all aided by the hard work of beavers. The dams beavers build\u00a0also provides an effective way to combat climate change, by storing water for human access,\u00a0reducing floods, inhibiting wildfires, and trapping pollutants. All we humans have to do is leave them alone to do their thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beavers are incredible workers and can be seen as a linchpin species because of all that they do for the watershed ecosystem and even for the environment on a global scale. Protecting them\u00a0is extremely important, especially as residents of the verdant Pacific Northwest. For Earth Day 2020, we hope to\u00a0increase appreciation of these wonderful animals and what they contribute. We encourage you to be vigilant for construction projects that are irresponsible about cutting down forests or disrupting beaver dams, lodges or the\u00a0waterways and ponds they are build on, and to further our mission of awareness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, and we hope you enjoy our game!</p>\n<p>essay source</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Developer: Douglas Winegarden</p>\n<p>Sound and Music:\u00a0Jake Kargl</p>\n<p>Assets and Animation:\u00a0Zachary Tenorio</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Sam Xiao for writing our game's description and Andrew Swanson for creating our video promotional material.
