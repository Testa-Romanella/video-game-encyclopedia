This is Super Super Nova.</p><p>Super Super Nova lets you blow up galaxies using a research-grade \r\nsimulation code. You can explode stars at will, with the goal of blowing\r\n as much gas out of the galactic disk as possible, all set to a \r\nprocedural soundtrack.</p><p>Super Super Nova was made for Game Boy Jam 3 (#gbjam3). It uses the code RAMSES (Romain Teyssier, see http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article.... If you want a better explanation of what's going on, try reading this paper - http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1395 (click PDF on the right hand side) - it's complicated, but you can look at the pretty pictures anyway. If you have any problems my research page with contact details is at https://geensastro.wordpress.com/ - probably best not to bug the authors of that paper because any bugs are probably my fault, not theirs.<br/><br/>There's a built-in help file (raw text in the folder data), so just run supersupernova.exe and blow up some galaxies! Compiling Fortran and linking it to Python on Windows is super awkward. Yay.</p><p>Currently there's just a Windows build, but complain enough and I might compile it for Mac and Linux when I get back from holiday.<br/><br/><br/>Sam Geen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30e16e6eb55be14f2fbc153e25857c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samgeen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
