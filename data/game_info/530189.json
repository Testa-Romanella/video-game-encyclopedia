Xbox One is recommended.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It has also come to my attention that there are numerous game breaking bugs currently. At the moment, I do not have time to fix these issues, as I'm a one man team. I'm currently focused on my next project.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please leave all bug reports in the comments below and I will get back to them ASAP.</strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE RUN </strong>Ninja Darter.exe <strong>AFTER UNZIPPING </strong><strong>TO START THE GAME.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>This iteration is intended to be an improvement to the first Ninja Darter.</p>\n<p>This version includes more responsive player controls, as well as:<br/></p>\n<p>-Wall jumping, wall sliding, dashing,\u00a0 and switching weapons</p>\n<p>- An armor meter for extra defense</p>\n<p>- Emerald collection as well as coins</p>\n<p>- An overall heavier and compact feel to player movement</p>\n<p>- Universal Render \u00a0Pipeline to deliver lighting to the world<br/></p>\n\n<p>List of bugs:</p>\n<p>- Don't stay on the title screen for too long as it hogs memory<br/></p>\n<p>- Emerald pick up and weapons switching doesn't work in some levels</p>\n<p>- XP bar may not work in some levels (cause unknown at this time)</p>\n\n<p>These problems were mainly a result from inefficient and/ or messy code. I plan to fix these problems for the full release: a game called MC Ninja.
