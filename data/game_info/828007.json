Some weeks ago I set out to make a complete game and this is the final result. I wanted to make something simple and decided to look for some classic games to take some inspiration. After some researh I found Space Race, an arcade game developed by Atari and released in 1973. Two spaceships compete to reach the top of the screen while they avoid asteroids that fly through space. I have copy the exact mechanics and only add some changes to the UI, so it feel more modern (like adding a timer with numbers, instead of just a slicer like in the original game).</p><p>Evidently, this project does not try to be perfect or even to be funny, is just for me to learn and go\u00a0 through the complete process of making a game, from prototyping to publishing. I thought it was perfect for trying to learn some useful things about making a game in Unity and so it has been.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you like it and I\u00a0can't wait to start working in a new game, probably something more original this time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T15:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/751/751ff8719a5b237f56d72e039da0a806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nedday"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
