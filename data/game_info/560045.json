You have made it to Space Station Tempest. The newly commissioned space station of the Earth Alliance. You\u2019ve unpacked your stuff in your tiny cabin when all of a sudden, alarms start blaring all over the place. You have no idea what is going on, you\u2019ve been on the station all of 20 minutes...<br/></p>\n<p>There is a pounding on your door.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen up, rookie!!!\u201d</p>\n<p>You open the door to find a grizzled old moonwalker with his space suit half on.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, rookie, don\u2019t you hear the alarms! We gotta get off this tub! The geniuses on Earth uploaded new beta control software for the station, and it\u2019s screwing up in a huge way! The core cooling systems are offline and the tech heads can\u2019t seem to get things working. The core is going to blow in about 3 minutes! If you don\u2019t get off by then, you\u2019ll be nothing but static!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose Earthers really mucked things up good! Gravity and life support are also offline, you probably noticed the air starting to feel sticky! Get your suit on and head for the escape pod now! Without gravity, it\u2019s going to be tough navigating the space station. You\u2019ll have to use the recoil from your SLED (SLug &amp; Emp Device) to maneuver around the corridors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s not bad enough, I\u2019ve heard the defense systems have started firing randomly in the corridors. Those things creep me out. They won\u2019t kill you, but getting hit by one will transport you back to your starting location! I have no idea how that happens, they used some crazy alien technology from Area 51 to make a non-lethal defensive weapons to put hostile boarders back on their ship. You can shoot these guns, but don\u2019t be surprised if they aren\u2019t disabled on the first hit, this ain\u2019t no game! My buddy from engineering told me that shooting the defensive guns will release some energy from the core giving you a little more time to escape. Don\u2019t count on it though, that core is going to overload.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hands you a simple display for your\u00a0arm band with a lit bar of red, amber, and green lights. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the core status, and essentially how much time you have left. If you\u2019re not in the escape pod before this runs out, you\u2019re done for!\u201d</p>\n<p>He heads back out into the corridor, \u201cI know you\u2019re new so follow.....</p>\n<p>Just then a bright yellow flash fills your vision and he's gone, hit by one of those crazy alien technology weapons. </p>\n<p>You\u2019re alone. You get your suit on and head out. You don\u2019t know the station so it\u2019s a maze to you. Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to navigate it in time to GET OUT!</p>\n\n<p>This game is has been entered in the\u00a0The C64 'Cassette 50' Charity Competition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/29694a1d8e8fe97b928437fc60789653.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mcassera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
