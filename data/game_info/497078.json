The aim of the game is to be the first team to find the key in the center of the maze and to escape from the maze at the opponent's entrance. The teams consist of two people who must work together to find their way through the maze. Player one is in the maze from a first-person perspective. Player two observes the maze from above to give directions to his / her fellow player on how to get to the center. Player two cannot see the entire maze, but only the center and a small circle around player one. Once the player dies in the maze, the players' roles will reverse. Player one then starts at the entrance. The players of both teams can encounter and attack each other in the maze.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b50c8e4b5db4dadaafd1392ee2ce0d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["YaBoiiiiiii"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
