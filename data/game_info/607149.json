Traditional linear narrative is a poor fit for a digital game, for games revolve around choices and interactivity. And as software products games offer a possibility for randomly generated content. This is impossible for other mediums, such as literature and film. We see these factors as possibilities rather than restrictions, and we want to explore how deep this rabbit hole actually is.</p>\n<ul><li>Good Mourning combines visual novels into a collection of mini games.</li><li>Emphasis is on a story and players are encouraged to experience it through several playthroughs.</li><li>The story adapts to the choices players make, and portions of it are randomly selected to ensure replay value.</li><li>Replayability is also a key element in the story, as well as the ability to choose and how other people perceive you. Choosing differently has an impact on the story and how it is interpreted.</li><li>The interpretation of the story is where the emergent narrative comes to play: the player sees only segments of the storyline, and the bigger picture has to be formed through imagination.<br/><br/><strong>Warning: The story depicts scenes of abuse, intoxication &amp; strong language.</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/5677e288d0d74c991b1ccef6dbf3556f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Platonic Partnership"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
