{"id": 961913, "slug": "square-inertia", "name": "Square Inertia", "name_original": "Square Inertia", "description": "In Square Inertia, you control this square that can go pretty fast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Around each of the 50 current levels, there are 5 coins to collect, and obtaining 3 coins opens the green goal point, allowing you to finish the level.<br/>Use the square's movement abilities and overall speed to set the fastest possible time on each of the levels. Utilize slamming, wall-jumping, and level-specific mechanics to traverse the levels and optimize your personal best times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By collecting all of the coins throughout the levels and setting fast times while collecting every coin, you can unlock alternate colors for your speedy square. For every set of 25 levels, there are 5 colors unlocked by collecting all 125 coins and another 5 colors for beating all 25 author times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can race against your personal best ghost or view those replays independently. Replays are primarily input-based with some positional guidance to mitigate performance variances. However, replays are not very consistent at below 60 frames per second, but most modern computers should be fine.<br/><br/>Square Inertia is a single-person project. There are currently no plans to release paid level expansions, and I plan to potentially add levels in groups of 25 in the future for free.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/46015c2082c7d2efa0d3aa43967966cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CyanOhm"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CyanOhm"], "esrb_rating": null}
