Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStaying sane is just as important as staying alive, as you balance mental health with physical health to get through each day in real-time. Develop unique relationships with every other character - from friendships and romances to rivalries and gangs - and live long enough to see them change over time, with a constant turnover of new faces.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis special desktop release is fully unlocked as standard, allowing you to save your changes to all characters to make the world your own. Extensive controller support even opens up multiplayer opportunities - where a fellow human can take control of someone else on the scene to help or hinder the star player!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-18T16:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8c5f01645e7e96d3be7c1ba9faf6fa8.jpg", "website": "http://www.MDickie.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["MDickie"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MDickie"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
