The trouble is, you have to get everyone a present for Christmas, and Christmas is tomorrow!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wander the town, get to know your new neighbours, help them out, and maybe you won't get eaten by Krampus the next day...</p><p>-----\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD to move\r\n</p>\n<p>look around with mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>E to interact/talk/continue dialogue\r\n</p>\n<p>P to check Inventory\r\n</p><p>-----</p>\r\nIn this Christmas\u00a0adventure, you will meet:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Mari Lwyd</strong>- the singing ghost horse, a tradition in Wales. She goes door to door, and if she out-sings you, she will drink all of your alcohol</li><li><strong>Saint Nick and Krampus</strong>- We all know them, but did you know they are sometimes portrayed working together? so that is implying Santa sees Krampus eating children and is just like, cool with it.\u00a0 messed up.</li><li><strong>Saint Lucy</strong>- a saint commonly celebrated with candles and songs in Scandinavian countries. She is often depicted holding a plate with her eyes on it.</li><li><strong>Yule lads</strong>- 13 troll like characters who often get up to mischief and stealing, of Icelandic origin.</li><li><strong>Schnabelperchten</strong>- a strange bird like old lady creature who goes to each house to check if its clean. If it isn't, she'll cut your head off with her large shears! Originated from Austria.</li><li><strong>Jack Frost</strong>- He's a mischievous spirit who brings the cold into winter.

She is sometimes said to hunt naughty children and steal their presents.</li></ul>\n\n<p>-----</p>\r\nWarnings:\r\n<p>the game is mostly harmless, but has bad language and a bit of edge to its humour. Its silly and childish humour, but it is not for kids.</p>\n<p>music is a bit loud at some parts (sry lol)</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in\u00a0our silly game! We hope you enjoy it! We are new to making games, but we will be making more because we had a lot of fun making Yuletown!
