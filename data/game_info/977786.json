But you trained as a doctor and know nothing about fighting. Will you help repel the invaders? How far will you go?<br/>\r\nEarth, Fire, And Wind is an open world martial arts elemental magic ARPG. Players wield the elements of the Godai: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void. But you can only fight the invaders with Earth, Fire, and Wind.<br/>\r\nThe art is stylized toward an Anime / Ghibli vibe. The music leans heavily to Japanese modern classical. The UI is minimalist. The focuses are exploration, combat, and then platforming. The open world is based on Taupo, New Zealand and as much as we encourage exploration, you will get lost and have challenges navigating.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Windows version is ready. The Mac version is coming soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T11:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/86396b1fffa19a3c58600a7d95be967b.jpg", "website": "http://www.seriousmlerm.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serious Mlerm"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Serious Mlerm"], "esrb_rating": null}
