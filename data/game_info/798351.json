In it's journey it must jump from shelf to shelf in an attempt to escape it's fate as a mere science experiment.</p>\n<p>SlimeLight was created in by Riley Page (Sea_Tiger) as the programmer and\u00a0Blobbing4Pixels as the asset creator.</p>\n<p>This game was completed in 3.5 hours in order to add a bit of playability after the core mechanics were added so unfortunatly doesn't qualify for the jam requirements of being made in under 3 hours. However as this was the first jam for my partner and I, I'm still proud of my work simple as it is as I believe it's the first steps that count. Now my journey has begun and won't stop any time soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T08:22:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sea Tiger"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
