Most players will be loyal members of the Blue Dragon faction, but each game will feature members of either the wicked Cult or mysterious Unseen faction, along with a few Neutral characters to mix things up.</p>\n<p>The unique Day/Night cycle allows players to congregate around the table, discuss their findings and accuse players of treason during the day and use their abilities to occupy, spy on, conspire against and even kill their fellow players at night.</p>\n<p>While Cult and Unseen players know their allies, members of the Blue Dragon must be suspicious of every other player to ensure that they don\u2019t fall to an evil plot.<br />\nEven the King is suspect in Throne of Lies, and the enemy\u2019s ability to convert other players to their side means that allegiances are always shifting.</p>\n<p>The game concludes when the Blue Dragon faction has disposed of all hostile threats against the kingdom or their enemies have seized control of the Throne of Lies!Additionally:Use social abilities to silence opponents, manipulate their words and actions, or even speak with the dead.<br />\nKeep precise notes in a journal to expose your investigation in the event of an untimely death.<br />\nLeave behind a custom, hand-drawn Deathnote to mock your attackers.<br />\nEquip armor &amp; weapons to customize your character and executions with absolutely NO pay-to-win mechanics.<br />\nNeutral players have their own objectives and missions to complete.
