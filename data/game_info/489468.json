But if a charged up\u00a0ball hits a player while having the wrong color the player gets damaged and his\u00a0size shrinks.<br/>First player scoring eleven points wins!</p>\n<p>This game is my first game made with Godot and I had a lot fun making it. It was really cool to challenge myself to make a game in a new engine.\u00a0 I spend around 15 hours on this game this weekend.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing and stay tuned for more games and updates!</p>\n<p><strong>All rights reserved, please do not distribute this game without my permission.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27cebdd3db1aed3d4e83951d008a8b9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jan Schneider"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
