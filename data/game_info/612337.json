Controls: WASD or Arrow Keys to control, mouse to change direction of head, LMB to shoot.<br/></p><p>For a first project, this was fairly simple to make, if it took a bit  of time to work out *how* it would work. I hope whoever else submits  that they had an awesome time making their game,\u00a0 and that they enjoy  the games they'll play to rate.
