The game had to be done within 2 days. The\u00a0theme was <em>sky</em>; additionally the game had to incorporate the two words <em>warzone</em>\u00a0and <em>doughnut.</em>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>First things first. The controls.</strong></p>\n<p>Press enter (return)\u00a0to start and restart the game. Press escape to quit.</p>\n<p>Don't get hit by the incoming missiles. The game ends as soon as you've lost five orbs.\u00a0Rotate your life force by using the left and right arrow keys or the left joystick on your controller. Dilate your life force using the up and down arrow keys or the right joystick on your controller.</p>\n<p>For convenience you may invert the controls using the I key or the Y button on your controller.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now. The concept.</strong></p>\n<p>The words <em>sky </em>and <em>warzone </em>are pretty self explanatory. For <em>doughnut </em>I strayed a <strong>little bit\u00a0</strong>out of the box by choosing the shape of a doughnut as the main game element. That counts. Probably.\u00a0The idea behind the game is one of initial misleading. What looks like shells dropping from the sky turn out to be lovely trees and the life force you are bleeding are actually\u00a0lakes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's two possible messages to take away, either\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>nature will outlive all of our conflicts, or\u00a0</li><li>we're bombing ourselves back into the bronze age.</li></ul>\n<p>It's up to you to interpret it however you see fit.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to comment/rant/provide feedback as you see fit.\u00a0Also, the code is available on Github.</p>\n<p>Cheers. Daniel out.</p>\n\n<p>Credits.</p>\n<p>Noise pattern used as base for the life orbs.\u00a0Background music by Kai Engel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T07:04:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56bb3f0cd4ede4cd7e5523b781bfe5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["daniellanner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
