I have not used any third-party game development kits, libraries or engine. It started as an OpenGL learning project and grew into a lightweight tabletop game engine for Windows.\u00a0 Along with some downsides like the lack of an in-game anti-alias switch, there are also upsides like a battery-saving design. The game runs at 60 fps but stops the GPU-load completely, when nothing is moving on the screen.</p>\r\nFUTURE PLANS\r\n<p>Later this year I plan to release another memo game based on this one.\u00a0 Look forward to many different card sets, gamepad support and maybe some stats.\r\n</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<ul><li>Windows 10 or Windows 11 (7 and 8 should work but untested)<br/></li><li>32 bit or 64 bit<br/></li><li> 2010 era CPU or newer<br/></li><li>Dedicated GPU recommended<br/></li></ul>\n<p><em>Please leave a comment and tell me what you like or dislike or what is missing.<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/7574440b860e77f817e17d44756cd7c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixelpeas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
