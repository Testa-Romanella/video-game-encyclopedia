This was made on Scratch. Credits to AverageDeku on Funkipedia for letting me use their oc Jay in this fangame and a few more.</p>\n<p>If you don't understand the phone guy, here is the gist of night 1 and 2: Phil goes directly to your window starting on CAM1, listen for footsteps. Kate goes directly to your door, she's quick and silent, check cams often, she starts on CAM2. Jay starts on CAM5, he takes the longest route possible, he'll end up at your window, listen for footsteps and vent sounds. CAM2 disabled on Night 1, possibly broken (cannon), Night 2 CAM2 works. Night 2 everyone is faster, beware of Kate. PRESERVE YOUR POWER OR ELSE!</p>\n<p>If you want to know who I am on Scratch... I am known as SimpleExeProductions. Feel free to follow me, I am active on there often.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T06:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e0f26ef270d594bc7223f28e7dbe807.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MatuTheDragonCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
