After all, there are so few actions.<br/>The difficulty of the game is divided into three modes: easy, normal and hard, and it is also divided into plot mode and no plot mode, with a total of six play modes.<br/><br/><strong> Developer's recommendation: [/ b]<br/>If you only want to watch the plot, you can choose easy plot mode to play.<br/>Just want to play the game of optional normal no plot mode to play.<br/>Want to challenge the optional hard no plot mode to play.<br/>It's better to follow the advice.

The W and s keys can adjust the attack direction.<br/>\u2014\u2014Tired death mechanism: in addition to movement and stillness and triggering, the object controlled by the player will consume physical strength no matter what he does. If the physical strength is exhausted, he can continue to play, but will let his health replace his physical strength.<br/>\u2014\u2014Somersault mechanism: This is an unintentional feature / bug. The combination of Ctrl roll and space jump can form a \"somersault\" action.<br/>The rest of the mechanisms are not unique, such as the property panel. I won't list them here.<h3>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014characters introduce\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</h3><br/><br/><br/><h3>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Q &amp; A\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</h3><br/>Q: The store display supports English.
