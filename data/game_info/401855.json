It's proven quite time consuming to add new entries, and as this was more a test of my skills if I would be able to create a small video game on my own. If you like the game, be sure to send me a message and motivate me to keep adding entries! Thank you in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me on guessthevideogame@gmail.com for feedback, requests or just to say hi!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:37:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f3fae5b6a3163ba6fbccbe1722a6efb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thelastreturn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
