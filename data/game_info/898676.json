They were controlled by the remnants of the government. Then it was decided to unite all people into one superstate which was nicknamed the Legion. They decided to elect a single emperor of the whole Earth. Not all people liked this approach. Thanks to one mad scientist, Mr. Kirshner managed to create artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence discovered the law of \"Magnetic Escalation\", thanks to which it was possible to collect large pieces of ore in one place in a short time. Also, AI invented many technologies that saved humanity and gave the green light. After a while, the AI turned off and disappeared. Dr. Kirchner escaped and was never found. Those people who were angry at the slavish conditions of the government and the anarchy of the emperor decided to unite in their group and fight back against this monarchical system.
