Your job is to make sure every child gets the toy they want on Christmas morning! Don't worry, your superiors will provide you with enough details to make the right call. However, if you notice any discrepancies, simply make a mental note and move on! Remember, we're all in this together, for the children!</em><br/><br/><em>TOYSPECTOR </em>is a small \"puzzle\" game where players must decide which toy best matches the descriptions given to them. Inspired by the game <em>Fingered</em>, <em>TOYSPECTOR</em> places players in the seat of a newly hired intern to Santa's workshop. In the shipping department. Confusion and deception are the main challenges in this somewhat bleak take on the often glamorized idea of working at Santa's workshop. Details get less reliable as the player progresses, and in the unlockable \"O.T. mode\", time makes things even harder!<br/><br/><em>TOYSPECTOR </em>was developed as part of my annual Holiday themed episodes of my game development series<em> Let's Dev</em>. Created from scratch in just under an accumulated 24 hours, <em>TOYSPECTOR </em>was my first attempt at something outside my comfort zone. And while not visually complicated, the project was a huge test for the work that went on under the hood.
