I\u00a0bit off a bit more than I can chew so it is rather rough around the edges and it was a real race against time trying to code everything in time\u00a0(I'm still a beginner), but I\u00a0hope you enjoy what I managed to fit in.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Please note: This game only supports a CONTROLLER / Gamepad right now. I'm working on trying to get mouse support! Sorry!\u00a0I ran out of time for the gamejam submission.\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Credits: I\u00a0used the Synty Sci fi pack for this. Code &amp; music by me (heckadactyl)\u00a0and Kat helped with the level layout. :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2873e611bc16e6644394c35a7a5e50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["heckadactyl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
