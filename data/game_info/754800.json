{"id": 754800, "slug": "limit-less", "name": "Limit -(Less)", "name_original": "Limit -(Less)", "description": "<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>\n<p>I worked on this game by myself and made everything except for half of the character model from scratch during the jam (an old model I've been working on). So, as you might expect the game is very unfinished and glitchy, but still kind of fun to kill enemies because of the hit-stun and attack animations<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Didn't have time to make some sort of win condition. The only goal you could have is to kill all enemies and topple the golden statue. You can open the gate by shooting the switch at the top. You can topple the golden statue by harpooning it</p>\n<p>edit: In the latest build, the harpoon isn't opening the gate, but luckily you can open it by running into the wall just under the switch. You can also topple the statue by running into it (no, gravity will not stop you)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click\u00a0 (LC) - attack\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Space - Hold down to Run</p>\n<p>Right Click - Aim Harpoon (VERY BROKEN CAMERA) Left Click to shoot, LC again to reel it in</p>\n<p>*Combos:</p>\n<p>LC -&gt; LC: Two-Hit Combo<br/></p>\n<p> LC -&gt; LC -&gt; LC :\u00a0 Three Hit Combo</p>\n<p>LC -&gt; LC + RUN (Hold) -&gt; LC : Four Hit Combo</p>\n<p><em>While running</em>: LC -&gt; LC : Running lunge/slice combo<br/></p>\n<p>T : <em>Special useless combo!<br/></em></p>\n<p>This is a combo that I spent a lot of time animating but was supposed to be part of the limit meter so I had to scrap it at the end. You can activate it with T, but it doesn't do damage or have any fancy limit-breaky effects</p><p>The combo timing is pretty hard to pull off. For the first attack, click at the top of the swing when the flash appears. For the follow up, click at the end of the follow-through when the weapon is close to the floor. If you hold space while you do the 2nd input, you can go into the 3rd and 4th attacks which are easier to pull off</p><p>* I added a white shine that appears on the weapon to indicate when to attack to progress the combo meter. This broke towards the end of the jam, so I had to simplify it so that button mashing works :/<br/></p>\r\nTheme: Limit\r\n<p>Alright I'll just come out and admit that I completely failed to fit the theme. I had the groundwork laid out but I <em>just </em>missed out on implementing it.</p>\n<p>As you attacked enemies, you were supposed to build up heat which increased a limi-gauge (like Devil May Cry). If your heat went past the safety limits, your gun would explode and kill you, so gameplay would have you trying to balance the limit gauge, while fending off waves of enemies. <br/></p>\n<p>I had the animations, and the heat tracker working properly, but when I started putting it together, everything else started to fail\u00a0on me. The enemy AI lost its mind, my animation tree started acting up, and the harpoon camera was a disaster (first time using cinemachine)<br/></p>\r\nRestriction: Control the Environment\r\n<p>I started this jam with nothing but an unfinished human\u00a0basemesh with no hands or feet and only half a rig.\u00a0So when I started doing concept art for the main character, the lack of hands was a bit of an issue. Long story short: the Harpoon-bayonet-flamethrower thing just sort of happened, so I ran with it.<br/></p>\n<p>The harpoon was a perfect candidate for this restriction so I knew I was going to need it to be able to pull stuff early on. The idea was that you would harpoon stone pillars, statues, and various props to open new paths and crush enemies.</p>\r\nThe Future...\r\n<p>My confidence animating humanoid characters is through the roof after this jam, and I had a lot of fun making all those attack animations. I definitely want to turn this into an actual game at some point but only after I do some housecleaning stuff like finishing the basemesh and rig, sorting out my gamejam\u00a0disaster code, and fleshing out the idea into something more solid.</p>\n\n<p>Music by\u00a0Kevin \"The GOAT\" MacLeod</p>\n\n<p>Exhilarate by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3727-exhilarate</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T17:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89abaf5765ed1480ef9ce5c9d217545a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Skleembof"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
