The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRead the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can't help the Kaplans if they know there's a ghost in the house. It's up to you to decide how Dan's career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDan's relationships \u2013 to his work, his wife, and his son \u2013 react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"A quite remarkable simulation of family life\" \u2013 8/10 \u2013 Edge\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\"Sincere, realistic writing and an inspired approach to player choice\" \u2013 Polygon<br/>\r\n\t\"The Novelist affected me, deeply \u2026 I frequently cried\" \u2013 Rock Paper Shotgun<br/>\r\n\t\"Stands head and shoulders above all others \u2026 well-written and genuinely moving\" - <strong>Indie Game of the Year \u2013 </strong><strong>Continue Play<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81ceb803fca0a7cb92d787d3a3add7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orthogonal Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
