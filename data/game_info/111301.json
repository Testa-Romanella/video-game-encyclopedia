The last vine left standing gets to bloom. Think minimal local-multi snake. Features 10 levels with beautiful palettes.</p><p>Don't worry, Vine Runners includes AI so you may play by yourself, but the fun really begins when you grab friends and family to do the vine tango with.</p><p>Supports gamepads but also has keyboard controls for up to four players!</p><p>Made as a submission for Ludum Dare 34 Jam over the course of 3 days. Based around the themes \"Growing\" and \"Two Button Controls\". Here's the Game's LD Page.</p><p>*If playing with all four on Keyboard make sure that numlock is off so that the blue vine can do its thing*</p><p>*Linux build untested*</p><p>[Post Jam Bug Fixes v1.1 12/14]: When playing with many human players one or more gamepads could override all keyboard inputs.
