You, as the farmer keeping all of these animals, will have to identify the intruder and yeet them out of the pen!<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the miniBeansJam 8 (\"Du solltest nicht hier sein\", or \"You shouldnt be here\") within 48h, which is now my third time participating in the miniBeansJam! Thank you for hosting these events :) You may encounter the odd bug here and there (such as the animals not moving for some reason), but that's just how jam games are sometimes.
