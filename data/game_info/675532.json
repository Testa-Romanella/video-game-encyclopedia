Well Mr. Penguin has a tiny problem: he can't swim.</p>\n<p>He has always been afraid of water since he was a little kid penguin.</p>\n<p>But rescue is near! A ship has been sighted near the ice floe.</p>\n<p>If you can make it to the ship you might escape.</p>\n<p>The ice is very slippery and unstable though. You can't really stop once you</p>\n<p>started moving. To stop you have to make use of your environment.</p>\n<p>Use your ARROW KEYS or WASD to move around!</p>\n<p><em>FYI: There is an ingame Pause Menu (ESC/PAUSE/SPACE Key while playing) where you can mute the music and restart or even skip a level.</em><br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>- Music</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Main Menu: Acrostics by Cityfires [https://opengameart.org/content/acrostics] Game: Caketown by Matthew Pablo [https://opengameart.org/content/caketown-cuteplayful] End Screen: Nature theme sketch by remaxim [https://opengameart.org/content/nature-theme-sketch]\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>- Graphics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Menu Backround: By Edurs Illustrations [https://pixabay.com/illustrations/snow-penguin-iceberg-arctic-6197832/] Penguin:\u00a0https://de.cleanpng.com/png-bmzw4s/\u00a0Gravestone:\u00a0https://de.cleanpng.com/png-bjz85w/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>- Fonts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ice Caps by The Font Nook [https://www.dafont.com/de/the-font-nook.d1411]\r\n</p>\n<p>Ice Age by Florian Doyen [https://www.dafont.com/de/ice-age-font.font]<br/></p>\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n<ul><li>Fixed Level 20 because i didn\u2019t worked as intended\r\n</li><li>Fixed Player being able to move while Level Screen was still showing\r\n</li><li>Pause Menu can now be opened via PAUSE and SPACE Keys aswell (ESC did not work in Fullscreen Web Version)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/83198d66b374239b7682fd30ad97d274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["voodinator"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
