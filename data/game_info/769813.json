It's a clone of PONG.</p>\n<p>This game is super basic. I know all my games are basic, but this one takes the cake. Only a single sound effect, no menu screens, very simple GUI. It does feature a pause function, but it's barely more than just the function. Additionally, the ball speed will increase slightly every 20 seconds during a single round. It becomes reset once either the player or computer misses a shot.</p>\n<p>That's pretty much it, I made this game in a single day, once again following the tutorials from The Weekly Coder. I expanded on his design and added the sound effect, along with some extra text for controls and my personal tag. Pretty proud of that.\u00a0While I\u00a0always say I might return to tweak and fix functionality of my games, I wouldn't hold your breath on this title. It's essentially complete as is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:56:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4ee40d3432e2e6ff15d90591810684e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meter Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
