Download the game and get ready to rumble!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e8b625c1ab6405930c37bced7d3619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MultiverseRumble"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
