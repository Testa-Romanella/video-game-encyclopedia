This is a version of BBIEAL with semi-functional multiplayer, meaning you can create a game, give someone the name of the server you created, and then play with them!\u00a0Due to being an early prototype though, a lot of things don't function correctly, and I'm planning on remaking the game from a new unity project with multiplayer functionality from the start. Anyways, I hope you enjoy playing this baldi's basics multiplayer prototype, and a lot of testing went into this project to even get it working in the first place!</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<p>Gamebanana Download:\u00a0https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/12977</p>\n<p>Gamejolt Download:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/baldi-multiplayer-prototype/542549</p>\r\nServer Status (10/4/20 @ 3:52 PM EST)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0631df167d0ca17024a8039346010a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnsterSpaceGames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
