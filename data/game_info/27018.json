Players take \n      control of receivers and running backs. The game is filled with great \n      action, like quickly moving the controller to break a tackle. Play \n      alone, or with up to four players in a two-on-two match. Experience the \n      best moments of both competitive and cooperative play, finding holes in \n      your opponent's defense, then savor the thrill of receiving a pass \n      thrown by your teammate. In addition, game options such as play time, \n      team division and difficulty level can be adjusted.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
