{"id": 689545, "slug": "birdwatch", "name": "BirdWatch", "name_original": "BirdWatch", "description": "<p><strong>BirdWatch </strong>is a game of camouflage, paranoia, and patience. In it, you play as either a farmer or as a government drone designed to look like an ordinary bird. As a farmer, you know the government is watching you via these birds, and your objective is to discover which, among a flock of real birds, is the government spy, and then shoot it down with a can-launcher. As a bird drone, your objective is to scan the farm, looking for individual objects of alien origin, which the farmer has collected from a recent UFO crash.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay unfolds as the two teams struggle to complete their goals. If the drone bird team is destroyed, the farmer team wins; if the bird team manages to scan enough alien objects, it wins.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed as an assignment for the Game Development program at Algonquin College.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Team: Tin Foil Haberdashers</p>\n<p>Team Members:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Edimilson Ribeiro da Rocha Junior</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Chris Myers</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Christopher Chellew</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Colt Morrell</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Aiden White</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Jacob Kaplan-Hall<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12a/12aa2196b1e55f754db44b81e1015e27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["juninhostrife"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
