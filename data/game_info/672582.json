Though to be fair, I put a tremendous amount of  effort into my submission and I think the \"Standard\" experience will be  worth your time!\r\n</p>\n<p>Other than that, please have fun with my interpretation of the boss.\r\n</p>\n<p>And good luck to all other participants!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408f8338ab08b52001e5362d31e565fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScorchedGround"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
