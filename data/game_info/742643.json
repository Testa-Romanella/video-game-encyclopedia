Avoid deadly obstacles such as cactuses, birds,\r\n    snakes and scorpios. Don't even ask why she is constantly running.</p>\n<p>T-Rex 64 offers 14 action packed levels in 3 distinct worlds, dedicated music, joystick and keyboard support. This\r\n    single file game works well with real machines and emulators, any CBM disk drive, tape, SD2IEC and Easy\r\n    Flash.</p>\n<p>Both PAL and NTSC machines are supported, except for \"the very early 64 cycles per raster\" NTSC variants. If you\r\n    have any problems with this particular VIC-II model, please post a comment below and I'll try to fix it.</p>\n<p>Pro tip: if you're bored with PAL version, try NTSC - the gameplay is more \"interesting\" there!<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>\r\n    Jump or duck to avoid obstacles.\r\n    Any contact is extremely unpleasant and decrements your precious spare life amount.\r\n</p>\r\nTitle screen options\r\n<ul>\n<li>F1 - game control method; joystick port 2 or keyboard.\r\n    </li>\n<li>F3 - ingame music or just SFX.\r\n    </li>\n<li>F5 - selection of starting level.\r\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Start the game with either FIRE or SPACE key press. </p>\r\nGame controls\r\n<ul>\n<li>Joystick: UP or FIRE - jump, DOWN - duck.\r\n    </li>\n<li>Keyboard: SPACE - jump, Commodore key - duck.\r\n    </li>\n</ul>\r\nRequirements and running the game\r\n<p>You need a Commodore 64 / 128 machine or an appropriate emulator to play the game. We deliver a bundle of PRG and D64\r\n    files.<br/></p>\n<p> Easiest way to run the game on PC is to use Vice emulator to run PRG executable: <br/></p>\n<p>x64 rex.prg </p>\n<p> Use D64 image to run T-Rex on real Commodore 64. Copy the file to the USB drive / SD card and use it with Ultimate\r\n    1541 or SD2EIC. Once mounted, the game can be loaded simply by:</p>\n<p>LOAD\"*\",8</p>\n<p>RUN</p>\n<p>For a really old-school experience you can also transfer D64 directly into 5.25 floppy disk and run it\r\n    from 1541. <br/></p>\n<p>The game can be also run on Android phone via Frodo C64 emulator. \u00a0Detailed instructions can be found in this devlog entry.<br/></p>\r\nAuthors\r\n\r\n<p>Level design, graphics:\u00a0 Zuza Ma\u0142ecka, Ola Ma\u0142ecka.<br/></p>\n<p>Code, music, graphics:\u00a0 Maciej Ma\u0142ecki.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The authors would like to appreciate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mads Nielsen for KickAssembler compiler.</li>\n<li>Subchrist for Charpad Pro and Spritepad Pro software.</li>\n<li>Cadaver for Goattracker and player routine.</li><li>Paul Hocker and co. for Kick Assembler plugin for VSC.</li><li>Skoe for EasyFlash 3 and USB transfer - this really speeds up testing on real hardware!</li>\n<li>Micha\u0142 Taszycki and his 64spec tool to enable testing for tons of library code I wrote for this project.</li>\n<li>The Commodore community for support and testing: Commodore NTSC Users FB Group, Retroassembler FB Group, C64 Portal, c64scene.pl.</li>\n<li>Original creators for this nice little game concept from Google Chrome.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582b0b8f20003da974161070eea3b102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maciej Ma\u0142ecki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
