However, Eiichiro Oda (One Piece's original creator) has become very jealous by this games success. After failing in suing them, he decides to employ an infamous hacker named \"Lilbytes\" to hack into One Piece Online, steal the devil fruits and start giving them to random noobs who don't deserve them. The game has been thrown into utter turmoil because of this and now it is up to Pinto (OPO's stronger player) to defeat Lilbytes and his army of devil fruit-baring noobs. With the help of his semi-loyal friends, can Pinto stop Lilbytes in time, or will Oda have the last laugh?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/58965e76d407c07c7e732c2cb81623e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["OnePieceOnlineRPG"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
