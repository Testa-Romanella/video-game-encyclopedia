Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics.</p>", "metacritic": 94, "released": "1996-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3a8/3a82d7f5c90ab082fe475e28d58bee8b.jpg", "website": "https://quake.bethesda.net/en", "rating": 4.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 114, "owned": 2413, "beaten": 394, "toplay": 54, "dropped": 157, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 178, "ratings_count": 459, "suggestions_count": 470, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 464, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "Linux", "Classic Macintosh", "Xbox", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo 64", "SEGA Saturn", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["id Software", "Midway Games", "Lion Entertainment", "Lobotomy Software", "Tectoy", "clickBOOM Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "id Software", "GT Interactive Software", "GT Interactive", "MacSoft", "Midway", "Tec Toy", "Midway Home Entertainment", "GT Interactive Software Europe", "PXL Computers", "MacSoft Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
