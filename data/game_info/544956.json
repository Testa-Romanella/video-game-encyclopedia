Henry &amp; Luty (Programmer)</p>\n<p>2. Jinzhao (The team leader)</p>\n<p>3. Flash &amp; Tsinny &amp; Jack (artist)</p>\n<p>This game only has one target, that is to escape from the shop!!!!!</p>\n<p>Currently, the destination has been set at the cashier bank. To win this game, player needs to move all of the characters to the <strong><em>red point</em></strong> on cashier bank.</p>\n<p>Here is a brief introduction about the game mechanisms about each character we designed.</p>\n<p>1. The Chips<br/></p>\n<p>For chips, there is a height limitation for falling. So always bear in mind that step on somethings (e.g. other chips lol) when you are falling from a relatively high space.</p>\n<p>2. The sausage</p>\n<p>For sausage,\u00a0 the height of its jumping is depending on how long you hold the SPACE button. Please use this characteristic to reach some secret space!</p>\n<p>3. The Scissors</p>\n<p>For Scissors, it can sprint for a while after you holding the SHIFT button. So it has the highest agility. Be wise on using this feature!</p>\n<p>Last but no least, hope you guys can enjoy this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T06:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d0259eb30ce5db2a84923525cc702f55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Henry_yin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
