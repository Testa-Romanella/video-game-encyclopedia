Your mission is to purge all bugs from the surface of the Cosmic Tree to help it heal completely. To do that, Sid can plant itself in the ground and harness the power of the tree to become badass and shoot its enemies. It can't move while it's planted, and there are also power ups that Sid can find that go away once it unroots, so the player must carefully choose where and when to plant.<br/></p>\n<p>The game has the following features:</p>\n<p>- Action gameplay with a little depth</p>\n<p>- 3d polished graphics</p>\n<p>- Adaptive music</p><p>Credits to Pablo de Haro (Programming &amp; Design), Francisco Melink (3d modelling, rigging, animation and texturing), Alejandro Assi\u00a0(Programming &amp; Design) and Federico 'Skane' Wanzo (Music &amp; SFX).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T15:37:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0ed8b4d14b0f72bcd9cb5c92dd8391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["fannypackstudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
