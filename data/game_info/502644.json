My role in this project is the programmer who implemented the facial detection with OpenCV and player controller in Unity. It is a special AR game that provides the player with indirect control(camera) rather than traditional input(mouse or keyboard) to explore our beautiful virtual world. The idea of this game is to let our players feel very freedom as well as enjoy the gameplay experience we designed for them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e21170d4ba1038e22f9c381da7557b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AaronFan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
