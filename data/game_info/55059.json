It was the first game to be developed by Traveller's Tales. Leander is often compared to Shadow of the Beast, an earlier title by Psygnosis.</p>\n<p>It was designed to run on the earliest Amigas with only 512KB of Chip RAM, such as the Amiga 1000 and A500, which pushed the then 6 years old OCS chipset to its limits. The original version was developed on the Amiga, then it was converted by Philipp Wyatt for W.J.S Design on the Atari ST. A year later it was ported to the Sega Mega Drive as Galahad, which was published by Electronic Arts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa55bce9893a1caee18fb176d558481a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "esrb_rating": null}
