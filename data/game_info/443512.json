Their cultures and ways of living might be different, but they all share common understanding of logic and laws of nature. However\u00a0there are\u00a0anomalous phenomena in this world that violate those foundations of reality and\u00a0are strange and alien to everybody.\u00a0 The Taint\u00a0follows the secretive organization called Universally Unexplained Handling and Research that researches these anomalies as it has to reevaluate its files on them due to an incident that called a lot of information into question.\u00a0The story begins with UUHR researcher Chloe Halfmann, who is right at the center of the fallout surrounding the incident,\u00a0meeting a loner, stranger and outsider Agnes at a train station in a big metropolis. Agnes is a cyborg pursuing her own obsession with a specific phenomenon known as The Taint.</p>\n<p>The Taint\u00a0was directly inspired by the SCP Foundation. It's a long term dream project and I hope I'll get back to it at some point. This is a prototype that I made years ago and previous only showed to my friends. It's pretty weird and out there.\u00a0And it features a soundtrack that I'm very happy with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a8c0a25d32fdb25c63e6ffe52511e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["qptain Nemo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
