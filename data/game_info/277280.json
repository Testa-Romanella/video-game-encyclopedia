You've been a very good boy this year, and Santa has no reason to put you onto the naughty list. That is, until at the last minute. As he landed beside your chimney and looked at your most recent records, Santa has deemed\u00a0you to be put\u00a0onto the naughty list. So he throws away the presents into the forest\u00a0near your town, where presents were manufactured. Seeing Santa drop your presents in the near distance, you run outside into the forest, to be surprised to find a small town-like area. Little do you know, an evil spirit has wiped what was once this very festive and productive town of presents.</p>\n<p>A game-prototype made for the Scream\u00a0Season Game Jam using Pico-8. Can you find all 5 of your presents before the evil spirit captures you? Remember, follow the candy canes! They hint to the present locations.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is unfinished.
