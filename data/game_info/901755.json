I put a lot of work and time into this game and i really like how it turned out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Custom Map support is in game and they are very easy to make and import it just creates a folder in wich it creates the audio file the data file and you can even add a cover (optional).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The gameplay itself is hard to read so good luck with that haha, no but really i tried to make this as readable as possible, didint turn out great but it is still really fun! It was really hard to think of a better way so if you have any suggestions join the discord!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I have created a discord server where you can share or request your beatmaps! You can also have a great time, follow the game updates, discuss about the game, make petitions of what you would want to be in the game and just discuss about the game!<br/>https://discord.gg/C7BAanBSkK<br/><br/>Have Fun!<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>Scinacz (Main Dev and Creator)\u00a0<br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzwWaE1n6W-XUGktyQak48w<br/><br/>KillerAvecRage (Charter)<br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0o4ZdXc6roMybsXqzuFb6g<br/><br/>AlexBamZ (Music)<br/>https://www.youtube.com/@AlexBamZ<br/><br/>HyperAzuL (Music)<br/>https://www.youtube.com/@BlueIzHyper_92<br/><br/>Denis From Mesote Games (Help)<br/>https://mesotegames.com/<br/><br/>ThePikaSquad (Help)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T06:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e6e5029caffe5536c999ac2ffa82bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scinacz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
