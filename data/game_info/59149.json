Venture through ancient Rome with the help of Agrippa (a soldier whose father is accused of murder), Octavius (Agrippa&#39;s best friend), and Claudia (a female gladiator). The game automatically switches between Agrippa and Octavius so you can use each character&#39;s special skills to accomplish goals. You can also participate in gladiatorial events, such as chariot racing, tournament battles, and deadly duels.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2005-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T19:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9d0/9d062378de5103c43bbb7f5a705c7e10.jpg", "website": "http://www.capcom.com/shadow/", "rating": 4.5, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 14, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 7, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 548, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Capcom Production Studio 2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
