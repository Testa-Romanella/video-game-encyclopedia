It has been fixed in v1.1 so please download the new version!</p>\n<p>Banana and Sprite are out on a walk! What happens? Find out in this thrilling <em>(it's actually pretty chill)</em>, and\u00a0\u00a0crazy<em> (again, pretty chill)\u00a0</em>adventure!</p>\n<p>Made for an Asset Flip jam! All assets come from the original selection, minus the background music which is the song\u00a0Becoming\u00a0Friends from Danganronpa\u00a0V3.<br/></p>\n<p>While we had a pretty tight schedule for this jam, I've\u00a0wanted to learn RenPy, so I decided this might be a good time to give it a shot. While it's not a terribly difficult engine to work with by any stretch of the imagination, it did take a bit to adjust to something that wasn't unity lol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No web version because RenPy's default web export doesn't work on itch, and\u00a0the web export for itch specifically is windows only, which I\u00a0don't have currently. So enjoy the desktop versions.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>v1.0 - Crashes before reaching the end of game (Fixed in 1.1!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c9035be267ea315dd015bd8f84ce241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Miles Logan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
