Start fresh every time, using only the items found in your current run to get as far down as possible!</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0Chill in the lobby between runs and talk to people, read, or try to draw your favorite color!</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0And most importantly, have fun!\u00a0<br/></em><em>(And watch out for those secrets!)</em></p>\n<p>This game combines the turn based combat of classic RPGs with the risks of roguelike dungeon crawlers (all items and levels are reset at the start of a new cave run / items and enemies spawn randomly). Even though every run starts fresh, future runs can be made a little bit easier if you have the... right connections. If you successfully complete the cave, you can also try harder modes that limit how many helpers you can take in your party.<br/><br/><strong>This game is currently\u00a0in development</strong>. The current version fully functions with a 20 floor cave and a lobby to explore. The complete version is intended to have 100 floors, much more content and secrets, and new art / audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T11:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c19d72d4b88fb0b3cdbe390b70cd12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s1xplus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
