I made this it in less than 2 weeks, working a maximum of 5 hours / day (most days, it was more like 2 or 3 hrs). This game is purpose-built for the Low Rez Jam, and I'm proud that I finished.</p><p>But, I didn't have time to do everything I would've liked.  I had to scramble to finish this game. \"Everything I would've liked\" includes play testing and making the sure the game is actually any fun... I plan to add features later :-D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/83694b4963810b1fe79da2e63bd4bff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["masskonfuzion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
