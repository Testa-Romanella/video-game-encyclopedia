I also created the logo and production video, drafting a script for the audio narrations.</p><p>I learned a great deal about time management and in using Trello for the first time, I have gained a valuable organisation\u00a0tool that I now use all the time. The added curve-ball of a national pandemic certainly piled the stress on and showed that I work well under pressure, as a majority of the production was done by myself in the final weeks before the deadline! Luckily I had one lovely teammate who kept all of the paperwork in order and helped keep me sane.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:44:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb634b2be2fe526121791a288d2bf6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
