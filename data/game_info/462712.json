But have you played them in real life? Grab your friends and play it anywhere! Create an operation where others can join in on your custom field, or choose an existing field. Join a squad or go solo.  Watch out for bombs, they may slow you down! Get the drop, you might find it valuable. Anyway you play it; get to the next zone before the existing one collapses!  Will you survive -- or will you fail?<br/><br/>Bring your choice of weapons -- Airsoft, Paintball, Nerf\u2122, Laser Tag, or play in the night as rubber knife wielding ninjas. Try playing without weapons, flag football style!
