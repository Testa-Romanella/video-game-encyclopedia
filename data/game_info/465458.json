The sheep are starting to run out around out of</p>\n<p>control! Herd them back into the broken pen and prevent them from eating all<br/>the flowers.

Watch out for that pesky<br/>squirrel too!</p>\n\n<p>This game was our first attempt at ever entering in a game jam. It's also our first attempt ever at really making a project in any video game engine after regularly tinkering for a few days every 6 months or so for the past 10+ years. It's not great, but it's our first attempt and we're proud of it!\u00a0</p>Credits:<p>Programming: Connor Trostel, Nick Bunting</p><p>Art: Connor Trostel, Nick Bunting</p><p>Music: Connor Trostel,Nick Bunting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/6867ad04d5e8d83d439b4a233d10a3f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dipsmac"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
