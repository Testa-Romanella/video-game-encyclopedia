A derelict transport ship, the Charon, is on a collision course with Acheron Station, and it's the Mechanic's job to board the ship and prevent that from happening.  His eidetic memory makes completing the contract straight forward, but the context regarding the Charon's current state makes the decision to do it much more complex.</p>\n<p>Time is running out. Use your memory of the ship to guide you.</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>BennyKill709\u00a0<br/>Ching<br/>OwThatHerz<br/>Jules<br/>Rhythmsafox<br/>Sparky</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a2ce3bce2ca1fa46af4a9be1f6060a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jules"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
