The player must avoid random thrust forward attacks as the screen automatically scrolls left. The boss is always visible during play with a dynamic position due thrust attacks. The boss is created using the\u00a0Overlay Window Layer\u00a0and a sprite with largest possible collision boundary box (128 x 128px). The sprite's location is synchronized with the overlay windows movenment, the difficultly being that the overlay window and the sprite coordinates are relative to the screen and camera respectively. Pinned sprite's cannot be used to overcome disparity as they lack the \"On Collision\" event, instead you'll need calculate the overlay window position as if is camera relative. Once the calculated overlay position is known, set the sprite to that location. This needs to be done every frame to insure that the boss' collision boundary box is in the correct position.</p>\n<p><strong>Written tutorial with screen shots, detailled descriptions and\u00a0source code</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/phinioxGlade/gbstudio-auto-scroller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T08:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/79398dcc85694913511ad6f3f3bbb1fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phinioxGlade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
