Thanks for checking out this early access page - clearly you're someone who's looking to be the first to find the hottest games so hopefully this one won't disappoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Why</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I think understanding why something is made is extremely important. To keep it short and sweet, this game (like all my projects) has been made with one core purpose: to provide value. Whether it's making someone smile, giving them a little frustration in getting the next high score, or simply filling out some time on a long commute, I truly hope it brings you a little value.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made using Unity, downloadable icon packs and a whole lot of free tutorials (along with a little programming knowledge and experience). I have learned a whole lot through the process of creating games (this is the first one being published but certainly not the first one made!) and have actually thought about making a separate post on my best lessons, tips &amp; tricks, and some of the useful resources - if this is something you'd be interested in please let me know!</p>\n<p><strong>What</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a game combining a few aspects we all love, precision, patience, aim... just kidding, it's ice-cream! If you don't want to at least give it a chance for this simple reason I'm not sure what else I can say. The best way I could describe this game is by saying it recreates the feeling you get when you throw a piece of paper into the bin proudly screaming \"Kobe!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Information</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is currently out on Apple Pre-Order and is going to be released on 10th April 2019! Happy playing!\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T06:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b30ae728bb5020a82dc1bccb0f0b8ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMZI Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
