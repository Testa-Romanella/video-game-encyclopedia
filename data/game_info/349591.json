Auto-targeting projectiles will fire as you remain within proximity of enemies and a downward stomp allows you increase your damage output. Learn the different enemy types and behaviours to achieve a devastating finesse in combat.<h3>Progression</h3>Rogue Glitch is packed with unlockable items, characters and cosmetics to make every run a worthwhile one. Experience is awarded based on performance which will provide random item unlocks on level-ups. Bosses drop a currency called Malbytes which can be used to upgrade your existing characters into more powerful evolutions. Finally, each completion of a run will progress the story with a mysterious lovable villain, earning the new character variants.<h3>Story</h3>You were once a regular platforming character, running, jumping and shooting in your little 2D world. However things are starting to get weird. Your levels are being scrambled, pick-ups modified, and enemies mutating, The origins of these happenings are unclear but you are curious enough to proceed deeper into the unknown. You meet an ominous being who wants to make a deal...<h3>The Future</h3>Rogue Glitch was created for quick iteration and evolution. More items and characters are already on the way but we're excited to hear your ideas for glitched entities to distort your game.
