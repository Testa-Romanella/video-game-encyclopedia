Also, he can build robots to help him to grow carrot, grinder carrot into carrot residue, and fartharmore to help he to brew coffee. We think this concept is better to make as a game like Overcooked, and that may be so fun.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we cannot build a playable prototype game that match our concept within 48 hours at GGJ, so we decide use more a week to finish it. Finally we use 20 days to finish it, and bring out this game.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n\n\r\nGamepad/joystick\r\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Unzip and execute.<br/>This game requires Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime\u00a0and\u00a0DirectX Runtime\u00a0to\u00a0execute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Main Programmer/Developer: Cluias Lao<br/>Co-operate Programmer: Bone Ng<br/>Concept Art: Cluias Lao, Bone Ng<br/>3D Artist: Cluias Lao,\u00a0Bone Ng<br/>2D Artist: Bone Ng<br/>Animator: Cluias Lao<br/>UI Design: Cluias Lao<br/>Level Design: Cluias Lao<br/>VFX: Cluias Lao<br/>Voice-over: Emily Pun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T07:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc35795c9ef2bee67413f1d5398606a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dev Cluias"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
