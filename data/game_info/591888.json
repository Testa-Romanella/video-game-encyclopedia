It is named Tunnel48 and this is an infinite runner inside a long tunnel in which many obstacles are trying to break you. There is a particularity - if you want more visibility, you can go out the tunnel so as to run outside. It\u2019s easier to run outside - for this reason, controls are inverted. Also I added a leaderboard on-line so as to rival other players. The robot moves procedurally using a script controlling each part of its body. The tunnel has been done using a procedural way. I like this method. All scripts are available in the zip folders according to their uses. I hope that you will like my entry.
