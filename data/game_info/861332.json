You will have to shoot down enemy aerial targets that were launched from enemy rocket systems over your city. Air defense is a set of measures and weapons that help shoot down enemy planes, helicopters and rockets.<br/><br/>The game is not simple. You must aim and shoot not at the missile, but at a point further along its tracking route. Air targets are usually very high. While your projectile will fly to intercept the enemy target, a certain amount of time will pass. During this time, the enemy will fly some more distance. You must fire at this distance for your projectile to collide with the enemy missile. Remember that your weapon reloads. This is not an machine gun that can fire bursts. Therefore, each shot must be clearly on target.<br/><br/>To fight the enemy, you will have a normal projectile, as well as four additional types of weapons. You will be able to buy new weapons with coins that can be collected during the game. With in-game coins, you can also purchase powerful power-ups that will help you destroy the enemy.<br/><br/>Achieve new records and get new ranks! There are 24 different ranks in the game (4 categories of 6). To set new records you need two things. First, play more often and practice your shooting skills. Second, accumulate money to play a round with a large supply of powerful bonuses.<br/><br/>Forward to defend the airspace!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T04:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6a26d2d26ac5e027c2ae5bdef3daed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serhii Khramov", "Dmytro Pohrebnyi", "Illia Ustenko"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["General Script Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
