This gives the player a movement that horizontally and vertically goes around the edges of an in-game area.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Galactempest</em></strong> plays similar to\u00a0<em>Space Invaders</em>\u00a0due to the playable space fighter's fixed movements, but with different playstyle and gameplay despite being a tube shooter game. In this game, you can control the space fighter that moves around the lengths and edges of the playable area in 4 directions, usually horizontal and vertical axes, avoids enemy shots, and defends the galaxy from the waves of menacing enemy aliens and UFOs by blasting them with different weapons, including space bunkers that surround them for player's defense. Its gameplay also has a fast-paced action, especially the aliens speeding up each time you destroy them, an addable replay value for completing how long your progress is like most classical arcade video games from the golden age, and a lot more features for many chances to play.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:50:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee309fe3b3f9c3d00ef68940fc7c8001.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PSONIC Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
