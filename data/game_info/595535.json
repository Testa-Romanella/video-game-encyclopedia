This is caused by them seeing a pylon through walls as there is no code to stop this.</p>\n<p>if two dwarfs are clearing the same tile, the second to reach the tile will be forever stuck in place. This usually only happens if you are connecting tunnels together.</p>\n<p><strong>Major</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Destruction button is a bit glitchy right now, if you try to destroy something while a beam is fired at it. The game will crash. Also if a dwarf is walking to a pylon when you destroy it, they will wander off into the abyss.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:21:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9ba2ef6db0553285499963658dc5e37f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wolfier"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
