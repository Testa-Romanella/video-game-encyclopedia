The car's nuances during a drift will put your will and determination to the test. Sticking to it is worth the effort (getting that perfect drift feels so damn good). <br/>\n<br/>\r\nReach a state of flow as you try to beat your best times on Akina, Usui, Myogi, and Iro Hazaka Pass.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuilt by an Indie with love.
