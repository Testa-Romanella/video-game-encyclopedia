It begins with you standing under a tree while looking up at the mountain on a wonderful summer evening. However, it appears the mountain harbours a secret which can be found by exploring what seems to be an entrance at the underside of it. What is there to be found? That can only be known while traversing through it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5f4151cc99075c7b8ff250d585239f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CubicKerfuffle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
