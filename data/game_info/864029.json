Until one lucky duck gets gifted a mysterious power and it is up to them to thward the crow's reign of tryanny. Always remember, it's okay to fail, but never disappoint.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the AGDS Freshers Game Jam where the theme is 'it's okay to fail'. In the game you'll need to toy with death as 'failing' (dying) will send you to the worlds between and reveal paths not accessable from before. But dying after failing, now that's rather dissapointing which is never okay and you won't be protected anymore.
