Learn from your mistakes, remember the flavors of each oddly-named ingredient, and become the best smoothie barista! Or, you know.

The theme was \"Failure is Progress\", and this game accomplishes that by giving you no chance to make a good smoothie from the start (being the failure part of the theme), and you have to learn how the ingredients taste based on what you give your customers, even if they're unhappy with it (that's the progress :).</p>\n<p>All music for the game was made by me.</p>\n<p>All art for the game was made by me, except for the blender, which was made by a friend.</p>\n<p>All sounds for the game except the blender blending and the footsteps were also made by me. The blender and steps are sounds from freesound.org.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/322c6b15f0c88577fe8b36ebb0e5c2c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrispyBun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
