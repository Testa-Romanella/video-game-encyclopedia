The carnival features 3 minigames. Darts, a pellet rifle game, and basketball. <br/></p>\n<p>Requires an openVR enabled device to play. Was developed on Vive.</p><p>Aim with one of your hands and press the middle trackpad to aim with teleport. Use trigger for grabbing objects that you wish to throw. Use the grip buttons to grab objects that you want to use such as the pellet rifle. <br/></p>\n<p>This game took a good 6 weeks total to complete. Through my journey i've had demotivation before but with this project i had a pretty hard time continuing when i learned the vr specific information. I then remembered that this year is the year of finishing so i decided to complete it even though it might not be the best quality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll be posting a video up on youtube in the coming days.</p>\n\n<p>Youtube -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPq0I6U3VqCsLs_OuWL9Gg<br/>Instagram -&gt; instagram.com/leafmealonegamedev<br/>discord -&gt; https://discord.gg/UBT4Rpg<br/>itch.io -&gt; https://leafmealonegames.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7df/7df03b7f0655f9e0a016efe14691bc0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeafMeAloneGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
