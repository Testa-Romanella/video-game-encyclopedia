{"id": 649166, "slug": "concrease", "name": "Concrease", "name_original": "Concrease", "description": "<p>Two best friends discover a true horror left behind on Earth from back when people still lived there. Determined to stop it, they head to Earth to put an end to something that must have persisted for at least two hundred years.</p>\n<p>However, the psychological strain was too great for them, and they failed to do what they came to Earth in order to do. One of them lost his life, while another takes a young newborn with him back to Mars, hoping that raising her may help take away some of the guilt.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years later the game begins, with Argon, and his new partner Floe, planning on going back to Earth to finish what he and his best friend had started.</p>\n<p>Features of \"Concrease\" include:</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Enemies that drop the very skills they used to try and defeat you, equippable to each character.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> No MP/TP/WhateverP. (Okay, there's still EXP)</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Each character has a unique one-time use ability that can turn the tides of combat.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> No traditional healing skills in battle, outside of increasing the REG stat, which regenerates health each turn.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Sidescrolling RPG with stages.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Enemies have variants with tweaked stats and skills.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> Bosses that aren't immune to status effects; the first boss is much harder without them as a means to showcase this.</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong> No random encounters, but no escape when you initiate them.</p>\n<p>Now that Stage 1-1 and 1-2 are finished, a demo has been released. I'll update it each time a new stage is finished, until the game itself is finished. There will be 7 stages comprised of 16 parts in all.</p><p><strong>Progress: (2/16)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T03:37:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d77834e70f317d3455df581d36515af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Razelle Lockwood"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
