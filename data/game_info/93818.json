The aliens want you dead. They will kill you. They kill you every single time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow long can you survive the alien onslaught and live up to your name, The name of WAR DADDY?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n30 Seconds will feel like an eternity.</p>This is War Daddy<p>\"This is a Minter shooter with the finese removed and the volume turned \r\nto Bruce Forsyth screaming with the force of a nuclear explosion. Almost\r\n literally unplayable, but don't let that stop you\" - <em>Kieron Gillen</em></p>Huh?<p>War Daddy is the 2013 remaster of the classic star of the first Eurogamer Expo Indie Game Arcade, War Twat. Now slightly less rude.</p><p>That said, you get the rude version too so everything sort of balances out.</p>What do I get?<p>Windows! We all like Windows. You get the original War Twat for Windows, you get War Nose, the 2012 update to War Twat for Windows. You get War Twat:Colour Blindness Edition for Windows, proving that even a game like this can be made to be more accessible *and* you get the brand spanking new update War Daddy for Windows &amp; Ouya. Please note that War Daddy for Windows requires an Xbox 360 controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/6511fadb87932501b157fcf404a61be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobF"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
