{"id": 978476, "slug": "multicrash", "name": "Multicrash!", "name_original": "Multicrash!", "description": "<h3>What is Multicrash!</h3>Multicrash! is a simple retro-arcade-survival game where the goal is to get as many points as possible. Manage up to four roads, swapping the ship between two lanes on each road to avoid obstacles, pick up coins for points, or spawn another road. Each round starts off easy, but the speed of the game accelerates over time until surviving on just one road becomes almost unmanageable. However, there are ways to keep the round alive even after reaching max speed. Both spawning new roads and crashing will reset the game speed (yes, crashing can be good!) but remember, more roads = more points: Obviously having more roads means more coins spawn, but each coin is also worth the number of roads alive. This means that with four roads up, (4x coins spawn) x (4x coin value) = (16x efficiency!). The round ends when the last remaining road crashes.
