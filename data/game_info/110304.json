You are tasked with exploring the 4-level Dungeon, with 21 rooms each and unique paths. After collecting the Artifacts and Gold, you must defeat the Final Boss (Sweaty Steve). We're always adding secret rooms, NPCs, and items too, so keep your eyes peeled!\u00a0[^-^]</p>\n<p>This game was made using Bitsy\u00a0and Beepbox. The newest release will always be updated here and then added to the official GitHub repository. This game originated as a small text adventure, which you can check out and play on our website.

Each 50 represents an item you collected. Say your final score has all\u00a08 items, it would look like this:</p>\n<p>Final Score: 5050505050505050</p>\n<p>Simply adding these will give you your\u00a0final score.\u00a0 Please, feel free to post your score, gold count, and time (a thread has been created for each)\u00a0in the comments below!</p>\n<p>==-Important Links-==<br/></p>\n<p>Check out our website here!<br/></p>\n<p>OST\u00a0here!</p>\n<p>BeepBox online music tool here!</p>\n<p>HTML source files can be downloaded from this project's GitHub repository here\u00a0or you can get the newest release directly from this page.\u00a0 This game is open for modding!
