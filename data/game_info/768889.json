Unfortunately, that's about where the chad part of the story ends. Upon arriving in the country, they find almost no sign of human life and decide to split up, in hopes of finding someone other than them.  After driving around the country for hours, DPP finds a somewhat populated city with a ton of g*y furries, along with cancerous amounts of RGB. Knowing the past incident back in IKI with a furry breaking into the generator room, he can't help himself but to go in and end all of their lives - the Christian way.  After murdering a bunch of furries along with a Protogen, working at a rebranded IKI, and surprisingly finding ETAB in a disco club, the crew meets up to realize that it isn't just Israel affected by this furry invasion, but also the rest of Europe. And so they set themselves a huge task to wipe Europe clean of those hairy losers.\r\n</p>\n<p>P.S. You should probably download and rrun the game on an SSD. The fuhhys are so cring that they take up around 30% of the rendering cost.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T09:44:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98db7767db168f5bf6500fdad74329cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EC Himself"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
