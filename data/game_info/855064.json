Solve the mystery by talking to the locals and exploring the area.</em><br/></p>\n<p>You should be able to beat this game in 20\u00a0minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at making\u00a0a 3D adventure game\u00a0set in a fantasy world as opposed to the adventure game/visual novels with a more cartoony look and feel\u00a0I've made for previous jams (although I will make more of them in the future). The action mechanics could use some tweaking, but other than that you should be able to finish the game without too many hiccups.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My main goals this time around was to give the player more freedom to walk around the environments. I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed making it. :D</p>\n<p>Thanks to this game jam I\u2019ve learned how to make seamless textures and the basics of using Blender.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Astrud font (used for the logo) by Peter Wiegel</li><li>Illustrations,\u00a0 story, \"music\", additional 3D models\u00a0and\u00a0textures\u00a0by me.\u00a0</li><li>Special thanks to AmalgamAsh for hosting this jam and to the symmetry tool in Procreate for helping me make symmetrical character portraits.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Any resemblance to real persons or other real-life entities is purely coincidental.
