{"id": 401704, "slug": "twodo", "name": "TwoDo", "name_original": "TwoDo", "description": "<p>It happened a few months ago when I was entering my office building. I saw the guard playing ludo. 2 players and a few watchers. Ludo in its current digital form has been gaining a lot of casual players. Why not, it\u2019s been a household staple for as long as I remember. Even though it\u2019s a simplified and anglicised version of India\u2019s own Parcheesi, it is more well known and played. I have seen it being played in metros sometimes alone.</p>\n<p>As a UX guy, the thought occurred to me. Can they even see the board? As a player, I thought it must be so hard for 2 players to play on a 4x board game. As a board game enthusiast, I thought can it be modernised and remade for 2 players. So that is what I did. Cut it in half and viola, TwoDo was born. The first play-through on a rough sheet of paper, I quickly found out that the gameplay was a bit short. I really wanted to make a card game so I thought why not just go crazy with this and so the cards were introduced.</p>\n<p>It's still in it still a work in progress and there are a lot of things I need I need to add. The sound effects can work can you some work. I am currently thinking of a story to go around that and maybe new board layout designs that can work on it. There is the world's first game called the royal game of Ur which can be very easily ported to the engine maybe that's something that I could do in the future</p>\n<p>So why don't you just go and try the game out? It's free and available on Play Store and I love to hear your feedback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T03:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/400fd7604834cf752a04b79eac1370b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whoisda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
