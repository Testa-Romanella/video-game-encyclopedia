Get up close and personal with your partner as you share a controller operating two halves of a duo of creatures connected by an elastic band. Teams will have to stay in constant communication to stand a chance of getting through crazy, unpredictable obstacle courses to make their way to the finish line!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Each team uses one controller to play. Player one controls the left character with the left side of the controller, and player two controls the right character with the right side of the controller. If a player doesn't have a teammate, they can control both characters with one controller.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>SplitSide Website,\u00a0\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0\u00a0Youtube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f99d1bc07b6695aca3b3fd8b94a662b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SplitSide Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
