My game is still in development, but I put it here so that my friends and guests can check out the mechanics. The plot is still in development (it will be in the form of a screen saver with a choice), as well as training, so I will write the instructions for the game below.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Plot</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game takes place in space, far in the future, when in most of the known squares of the galaxy, electricity is owned by the company \"Zastra\". It produces capsules with a grown star inside, which is installed in cafes, factories, food outlets and other places. This star is a portable power source for various equipment.\r\n  </p>\n<p>And now, two twins-Kay and Kai, lose their jobs. Kay, who previously worked as a radio engineer, moves in with his parents to temporarily live with them, and Kai extends his contract as a navigator for another six months. The brothers are thinking about how to live their lives...\r\n  </p>\n<p>The mother of the brothers-Maria-comes across an advertisement that the company \"Zastra\" helps small entrepreneurs by allocating them a part of their business. And so the brothers began to grow stars on one of the asteroids.\r\n  </p>\n<p>(and I, as a developer, just want to grow asterisks)\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Instructions for the game mechanics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you start the game, you get to the main screen (at the moment of the plot, this is the opening of a business). There are five places for capsules in front of you. Click on one of the places.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>After clicking on the place under the capsule, you will be taken to the store. Since the budget is limited, you can only afford to buy 1 capsule, so click on the price (the capsule will disappear)\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>...and go back to the\u00a0<strong>main screen</strong>\u00a0(the interface buttons in the upper right corner).\r\n  </p>\n<p>1 button\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>exchanger</strong>\n</p>\n<p>2 button -<strong>\u00a0the main location</strong>\u00a0with capsules\r\n  </p>\n<p>3 button\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>base</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A capsule appears on<strong>\u00a0the main screen</strong>. Now you need to fill the capsule and start it. To fill it up, you need to click on the button with\u00a0<strong><em>the base</em></strong>\u00a0in the interface in the upper right corner. Before you will see the base and shining stars. Click on one (1), it will climb into the inventory (lower right corner - 2).\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Now go back to\u00a0<strong>the main screen</strong>\u00a0and drag the star from the inventory to the capsule. Great! Now click on the plus\u00a0sign above the capsule to fill it with materials (energy stone and savers).\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When the star is in the capsule and the materials are loaded... all that's left is to run the time. In the upper-right corner, under the three buttons, click on start.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Everything is ready. Tap on the circle drawn on the capsule!\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When the timer on the capsule becomes 0.4 and the star changes animation, then click on the star. The capsule will empty, and the asterisk will move to<strong>\u00a0the exchange</strong>\u00a0(1 button on the interface in the upper right corner).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Now you can fill the capsule as many times as you want with stars (but be careful, if you miss one of the frames in the circle on the capsule, the glass will break), and also sell stars through\u00a0<strong>the exchange</strong>.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>If you run out of materials above the capsule, they are replenished in the warehouse. The warehouse is located on the base. Go to\u00a0<strong>the base</strong>\u00a0via the buttons in the interface, click on the base door and replenish your supplies via the pluses.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Exchanger</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the exchanger, you can sell the stars (1), take the currency on credit (2)\u00a0and release the stars to the sky (without payment) - (3).\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Click on the circle next to the desired star to select it - the animation of the button selection will be played. Then click \"To sell\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"Release\".\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>What is planned to be added:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- training;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- screen saver;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- increase inventory;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- new capsules;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- capsule automation;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- library with technical materials on the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>I will be glad to know your opinion about the game, development tips, suggestions, bugs!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>This project is accompanied by a developer's diary on Twitter and on YouTube (voice acting is Russian, but there are subtitles).<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to write in the discussions, and you can also use social networks (I speak English and Russian).
