Devouring the entirety of the victim leaving gore behind. Thanks to an unnatural object, there is something different happening within the house.<br/></p><p>Shambler's Wake is a game made for a project in class. Which is to make a horror game within a month. My 2 classmates and I did our best with the limited time we had. This means even for a month, we still had other things to do, such as other activities for the other classes and some of us have a full time job. </p><p>I am sorry everyone for the death penalty but, you have to fear for your life. I am not doing cheap jump scares for the game but there are fearful moments as it is.</p><p>We had some troubles developing the game but we pushed through. There are some assets missing but we would not have enough time making it. </p><p>So, please enjoy the game, and I would love to know what you think of it after.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f167510dc733f63c2ae392a514af1a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jokerkingz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
