The game is in sideview. And it is centered on the four basic elements fire, wind, earth and water, following their strengths and weaknesses: Fire -&gt; Wind -&gt; Earth -&gt; Water -&gt; Fire.</p><p>The game's difficulty increases each second, so the increase in difficulty is quite subtle. That entails the increase in frequency to which the blockades and energies appear, the game speed and the horizontal size of the blockades.</p><p>The only input actions of the player are moving up and down, to dodge the blockades or get energies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c0/3c04a5df21a554f6754502d1337824b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Teharth Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
