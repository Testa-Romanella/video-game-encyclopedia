I lost so much time just because I didn\u2019t know how to do certain things with Godot.\r\n</p>\n<p>I also spent too much time on art. Eh\u2026 I wanted to do so much more, but you know how Ludum Dare is.\r\n</p>\n<p>Well, on the bright side, I learned a lot, and I guess next time will be more smooth.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you will have a good time playing it though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ecf5f146500d93db319b8681a35cd9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Scrolling Bird"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
