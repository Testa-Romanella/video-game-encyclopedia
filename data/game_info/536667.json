I might release it to the google play store some day, but meanwhile here it is ! You will need an android phone (or tablet, but i'll be honest I don't have one so I haven't tested it, so I can't really tell you if it will work well haha !). There are only 10 levels for now, but tell me if you like it and i will add more !</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing, i hope you like it !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T08:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/03288322b97e825a2f941f715fdf81e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["HortenseDoodlin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
