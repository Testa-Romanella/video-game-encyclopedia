Armed with La Sombra&#39;s mighty weapon and a mariachi suit endowed with supernatural powers, it&#39;s time for you to descend into the underworld and confront the mariachi legends and their minions-before it&#39;s too late!</p>\n<p>Combining side-scroller gameplay and vibrant Mexican culture, Mariachi Legends is a unique experience. Responsive, fast-paced combat combines with platforming, exploration, and plenty of quirky, old-school violence for a good cause.
