Bernidad when suddenly the wind blew him off! He rolled fiercely and landed on a single small point where he remains currently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is your job to make sure that Troll-Li does not grow too big and fall off the cliff and destroy the town of New Chadswick. However, do not let him get too small or he will melt. <br/></p>\n<p>Click on the snowflakes to collect currency to spend at the shop. Items you buy will either grow Troll-Li or shrink him. Some items have a stronger effect than others. Be sure to exit the shop and check back for other items!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39c49acff4bba768fd4ab76a82897815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Berni", "Moonsand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
