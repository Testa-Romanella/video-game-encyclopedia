You can sort all thoses boxes now !<br/></p>\n<p>It was made using the ruby programing language and the gem gosu only.</p>\n<p>You have to sort the boxes falling from the top right corner using three sorting areas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Boxes are placed on the conveyer that you can control the speed of. Clicking on an ejection spot will eject the first box to the sorting area.</p>\n<p>You can use the 1-2-3 keys to control speed and Q-W-E to eject boxes instead of the mouse if you want to.</p>\n<p>When your first box is placed inside an area, the color is chosen. Placing the same color for the entire area will give extra points.</p>\n<p>If a box leaves the screen, you get malus points. And if your dropping boxes reach 20 boxes, it's game over.</p>\n<p>Have Fun !</p>\n<p>Credits :</p>\n<p>sounds of Beetlemuse, JonnyRuss01, zivs, unadamlar, Mudkip2016 and Kastenfrosch from https://freesound.org</p>\n<p>music from syncopika of https://opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T05:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/13281097560cb80fd49aab0518ef0c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["guillaumequillet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
