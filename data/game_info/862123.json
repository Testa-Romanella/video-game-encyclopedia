Your mission today is to locate the phased who triggered the motion sensors in Sectors 4 and 5. When you find these phased, it will be up to your discretion for the best course of action to handle them. Our mission cannot be exposed, and the utmost secrecy must be ensured.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please be aware however, some of the motion sensors were triggered with unusual activity. While there have been few reports of them recently, there is a chance you encounter the unknowns. Do not panic if you do. Remain calm, and slowly sneak away. Direct contact should be avoided at all costs. We are confident in your ability to handle the situation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ps: I left a Radar for you, it\u2019ll ping every 10 seconds and show you if there is any trouble out there\u201d\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T11:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/568d6afe4bae2f044c51c7250eb81bb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nugamestudioclub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
