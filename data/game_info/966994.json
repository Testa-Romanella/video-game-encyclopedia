Traverse from seedy diners to bustling food courts and discover a tale of grease, betrayal, and survival of the crunchiest. This isn't just any food fight; it's a high-stakes battle to defend the deep fryer's honor.<br/><br/><strong>Details:</strong><br/>The once-dominant fast food is being overshadowed by the ever-expanding army of vegetables. These aren't your garden-variety veggies, though. They're organized, angry, and on a mission to make the world greener \u2013 by any means. Players must strategically marshal their forces, utilizing the unique strengths of hotdog, nugget, and other fried favorites, while facing off against formidable foes like the broccoli general or the relentless tomato.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>Choose a fast food you would like to be, choose a gun that you want, and fight vegetables, coming in waves. Vegetables are chosen based on the location of the player, for example, outside of the restaurant would be the cabbages. Each wave you finish you get the chance to choose an item, here are 2 types: passive and active, passive helps you in the long game, like speed, and active helps you whenever you choose it will, like a grenade to kill few enemies at once.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T04:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c6aca02769a7ed0f37fd773dc92e4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emet512"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emet512"], "esrb_rating": null}
