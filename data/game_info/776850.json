It is very unfinished and contains a major bug.</strong></p>\n<p><em>THIS GAME WAS SUBMITTED AS PART OF\u00a0</em>Week Sauce (Apr 2022)\u00a0<em>WITH THE THEME OF\u00a0</em>\"Pick a MUSICAL GROUP you like and\u00a0TURN THEIR NAME INTO THE THEME of your game.\"\u00a0<em>THE JAM TOOK PLACE OVER SEVEN DAYS (nonconcurrent). IT TOOK ME TWO DAYS TO COMPLETE THIS GAME.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong>\u00a0Click and drag the plugs into the available outlets. Plug in all the plugs to win.</p>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:\u00a0</strong>\r\n1. Very unfinished. Life events prevented me from working on this more. I\u00a0still like the concept and hope to go back to it someday.</p>\n<p>2. Wonky controls. The plugging in feels hit-or-miss. It works, but it's a little fiddly.</p>\n<p>3. Major bug. On the third and final level, you are able to plug in the plug with the brick in the wrong outlet while the other plug is plugged in if you angle it just right.\u00a0 If I revisit this, it will be the first thing I\u00a0fix.</p>\n<p><strong>THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK TO ALL JAM PARTICIPANTS!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Randy Fluharty, Creator of\u00a0<em>Plugging In Simulator</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T09:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a710effbc9707c3a37893b63028841cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yousayrandy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
