Added new Valentine\u2019s chapter in labyrinth style!<br/><br/>Overpainted - Imagine a novice painter, who was blindfolded, given a dozen cans of paint and closed in a strange room, ordered to paint everything around. The walls will be in the chaos.<br/><br/>This chaos you arrange in Overpainted.<br/><br/>A little hardcore but for everyone <br/><br/>You&amp;#39;re in a dark room. Visibility is zero. There is a wild desire to find a way out and get away.<br/>The only way to see anything in the darkness - spray paint to left and right. Painting - your vision and orientation in space.<br/><br/>Here you stay alone with reflexes and logic, good luck - it will be difficult.<br/><br/>Be careful, dodge from circular disks, overcome difficult obstacles, defeat enemies and use their abstract thinking to find a way out.<br/><br/>100 spicy, full of flavor, hardcore and colorful levels with dispiteous bosses are waiting for you.<br/><br/>If you are tired of usual platformer games and want something unordinary so here you are!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c85abd0bf7d012304280edfbd75dfc6.jpeg", "website": "http://www.milkybrain.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Milky Brain OOO"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Milky Brain OOO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
