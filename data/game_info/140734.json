Keep getting in someone's face until their persuasion-bar is full. When that happens, you have a chance to make your pitch and close the deal by pressing Space or (A) when \"Buy\" flashes on the screen.</p>\n<p>The Scam-o-meter is set off when you pester someone, and the game is over when it's full. The Scam-o-meter freezes after a successful scam, and resumes when you get in someone's face again.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c00b25d15a85a8d329cc9e0ae66e3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["alxm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
