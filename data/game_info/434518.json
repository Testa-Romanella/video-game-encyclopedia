I've been somewhat inspired of some pixel art on the web, but every pixel of all assets have been placed by me. I'm not a pixel artist, so it was pretty hard and took me a long time to do many things but it was a good experience.</p>\n<p>Hope you'll enjoy the game.<br/>Feel free to give some feebacks. I'll probably finish the game developement in the future, so i have to make it better !</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb8/bb89b4b95e3537a1d25c04b0b64bbceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akadream"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
