He will have to solve no more and no less than two missions; yes, TWO missions in one game. Hence the 2 in the title...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis time Peris will have to deal with a mafia boss and get the lost necklace of Sant Angelo, one of the jewels created by Leonardo Da Vinci. At the same time, he will have to find the mythical Holy Great Beer, a legendary artifact forgotten for centuries. Why leave such important missions to someone so incompetent? We have no such answer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis sequel will solve some of the unknowns raised in the first part, and features two new quests that can be solved at the same time.
