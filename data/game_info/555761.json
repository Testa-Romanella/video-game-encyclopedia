Playing \"Never Alone\" you'll be asked to solve different puzzles (currently 11) using up to 3 playable characters. These character's abilities are powerful, but can\u00a0 not be used on their own!</p>\n<p>Will you team up with our 3 heroines and help them overcome their challenges?</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Try to reach the levitating book at the end of each level in X amount of turns</li><li>Mind Harsh terrain! The maroon tiles will\u00a0cost extra turns to traverse.</li><li>Play with the Ice Slides! The girls will slide all across them with no extra cost of turns. They can be used in other ways too... experiment!</li><li>Avoid Dark purple tiles: stepping on them causes a Game Over!<ul><li>Use wooden logs to step over them. These logs can't be pushed, but can be moved... use your imagination ;)</li></ul></li><li>Doors will hault your advances. Step on the buttons to open them (they share colors). You must stay put! Going away means closing the door once again.</li><li>Balls can be pushed by moving into them (this costs a turn). However, they are useful in a number of ways...</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Scientist: Use her ability to link her to an object or another ally. Whenever the\u00a0 Scientist moves, her linked target will replicate the move (or at least, try to...)</li><li>Artist: Use her ability to Inspire an ally. Her target will move twice as much as long as she remains inspired!</li><li>Architect: Use her ability to exchange positions of two different allies! (She can be one of them)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click on girl: Set her as selected character. You control her now.</li><li>WASD: On controlled character, move on the grid. One step costs one turn</li><li>Press space: Start Channelling your ability (will cost one turn\u00a0 on cast)<ul><li>Scientist: Click on the object / girl you want to link to</li><li>Artist: Click on the girl you want to Inspire</li><li>Architect: Click one the first target, then the second</li><li>Space (again): Interrupt the channeling. No extra cost.</li><li>Right Click: End ability effect (if active at all). This will cost a turn.\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>R : Restart the level (go back ti default position)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Enjoy, Have Fun, and remember:</p>\n<p><strong><em>No Matter how hard the fight, you never fight alone!</em></strong></p>\n<p>X-Mat Studio</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developers of X-Mat Studio</strong></p>\n<p>Aar\u00f3n Guerrero</p>\n<p>Jose Lu\u00eds Redondo</p>\n<p>Oscar P\u00e9rez</p>\n<p>Alex Melench\u00f3n</p>\n<p>Adri\u00e0 Serrano</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>We did <strong>NOT\u00a0</strong>produce all art to this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credit and thanks\u00a0 to\u00a0Modern interiors - RPG Tileset [16X16] by LimeZu (itch.io)\u00a0 and\u00a0HD wallpaper: artwork, fantasy art, steampunk, room, laboratories | Wallpaper Flare,\u00a0VCR OSD Mono | dafont.com,\u00a0Fantasy Wooden GUI : Free | GameDev Market\u00a0and\u00a004b_30 | dafont.com for that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All audio used was either open source or self-made (contact us for the full list).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:55:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c67cf2afd7c073084189184b472860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adriaserrano97"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
