{"id": 423245, "slug": "couple-of-bones", "name": "Couple of Bones", "name_original": "Couple of Bones", "description": "<p>Help Mandy Bow and Davey Bones retrieve their lost bones. Two lovers tied by the red string of fate, they must use the power of love to overcome obstacles. Perform amazing acrobatic feats by tugging or boosting your partner. But be careful! With the power to tug at each other's heartstrings, mutual understanding is required. However, communication can be difficult when you're flying across the sky (or a skeleton with no jaw)! Solidarity is key! Play alone (swapping between Mandy and Davey) or with a friend (recommended)!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\nP1\r\n<p>A/D: Move<br/>W: Jump<br/>S: Boost [Hold]<br/>Q: Tug<br/>Space: Grab Vine\u00a0Hook [Hold]<br/>TAB: Swap</p>\r\nP2\r\n<p>K/[;]: Move<br/>O: Jump<br/>L: Boost [Hold]<br/>I: Tug<br/>[?]: Grab Vine Hook\u00a0[Hold]</p>\n<p>ESC: Pause</p>\n\r\nController [Xbox] (P1 and P2 with two controllers)\r\n<p>Left Analog: Move<br/>A: Jump<br/>Y: Boost [Hold]<br/>X: Tug<br/>RB: Grab [Hold]<br/>LB: Swap<br/>Start: Pause</p>\n\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>In single player, characters remember commands when held while swapping</li><li>The further away the characters, the stronger the tug!</li><li>Use Boost to become a launch pad for your partner!</li><li>Gravestones are checkpoints, make sure to grab them</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Source code available at:\u00a0https://github.com/dbelliss/couple-of-bones</p>\n<p>Art by Bitter Bomb (https://twitter.com/daBomdidangdigi)<br/>Programming by dbelliss (https://github.com/dbelliss)<br/>Music by Passive_Potato, Bitter Bomb, and dbelliss</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed52b00ef0c41d37791bfbaae0b77fa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dbelliss2", "Bitter Bomb"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
