Move to one of\u00a0the squares on the start screen to pick a level. Numbered squares are the objective, but don't expect much to happen when you collect them. Walls are destructible by bombs. Try different approaches out.</p>\n<p>Started in 2014, put on hold,\u00a0recently picked up development again. This is the game I've most consistently wanted to revisit and expand since then, and I hope someday I can finish it. For now, here's what I had way back when, without any revisions. Please excuse the mess\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f35/f3560b98a655d1d0df00ece98698aad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["brie_irl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
