Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and\u00a0long-term impact of your clinical choices.</p>\n<p>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Review case history\u00a0</li><li>Complete an evaluation, diagnosis, and brief intervention</li><li>Make a plan of care for your patient\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Case Content\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The MedConnect suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through NIH grant funding (#R43AA020456 / #R44AA020456, #2R44DK091144-01A1, #1R44DA035042).
