The wheel will spin and land on one of six slots that each deal their own dose of mayhem. The slot the wheel lands on is out of your control, but you can nudge it one way or the other by attacking enemies and collecting powerups. Combo together hits on multiple enemies to earn even more bonuses in your race against the clock to stop the wheel before it stops you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:30:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af2/af28c563f3d994b8601a5f05f44fdf10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["b0turi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
