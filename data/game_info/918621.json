Good Luck!</strong></p>\n<p>Color Meteor is a game where the player controls a planet that\u00a0must match its color to incoming triangle-shaped meteors. The player must change the color of the planet\u00a0\u00a0to match the color of the incoming meteors, avoiding collision with those of different color.\u00a0 The challenge lies in the speed and accuracy required to match the color of the incoming triangle meteors.</p>\n<p>This game is part of the\u00a0minimalistic assignment for NYU's Spring 2023 Game Design course.\u00a0 The assignment limits the graphics of the game\u00a0to simple geometric shapes and player interaction is restricted to a single button. The goal is to create an interesting game that emphasizes minimalism through its limited graphics and inputs.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Swap the color of the planet by clicking the mouse or pressing space key.</p>\n<p>Slides:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13yOPXfvmax5q5KoRuYOY4n0sdlaxHP5Z1iln9jFG...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T11:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac93f6ea465f9a3b21a1b7781cb98fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NiravGolyalla", "hshsilver"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
