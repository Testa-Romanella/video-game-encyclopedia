Now the walls have risen and the Genetically Mutated Proboscis Monkeys</p>\n<p>have spotted you, and what's more, they\u2019re hungry. Escape? There is none, but maybe you\u2019ll</p>\n<p>be able to survive long enough to die with the taste of pride in your mouth.</p>\n<p>It's not a banana is a simple top down survival score shooter. Avoid monkeys with your</p>\n<p>frantic movement (WASD keys), dash (spacebar) and banana (fake). Aim your banana with</p>\n<p>mouse and throw with mouse click to remain alpha and survive. Build up a combo by hitting</p>\n<p>multiple Monkeys within a short amount of time to rack up higher scores. The Genetically</p>\n<p>Mutated Proboscis Monkeys never stop coming, so stay on the move and land some good</p>\n<p>throws to keep them off your back. Your highest score will always be saved and you can</p>\n<p>easily restart the game by pressing \u2018R\u2019.</p>\n<p>With hand crafted assets made for purpose, everything minus the music was made for</p>\n<p>ScoreSpace Jam #15.</p>\n<p>Royalty free music made by the legendary Kevin Macleod of Incompetech.</p>\n<p>Chill Wave by Kevin Macleod</p>\n<p>https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3498-chill-wave</p>\n<p>Killing Time by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3953-killing-time</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>W A S D</strong> -- Move<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Space </strong>-- Dash<br/><strong>Mouse</strong> -- Aim<br/><strong>Left</strong> Click -- Shoot<br/><strong>R</strong> -- Return to menu (When dead)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/7639616eed42910a9c1c5d69ff688833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StayToasty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
