It puts you in charge of making your restaurant the best dining destination in town. Build and decorate, manage staff, keep your facilities clean, serve delicious food and more.Build<br />\nYou start with a small, empty plot of land. You&#39;ll need to build your restaurant from the ground up by placing walls, doors and windows. Once you have that hard-earned cash, you can buy more land and grow your restaurant.DecorateGuests want more than just good food - they care about your restaurant decor too. Make sure your restaurant is well decorated to keep them happy.Hygiene<br />\nWhen you don&#39;t clean your restaurant, it will get dirty. This will attract rats. Guests won&#39;t be happy to see rats, so it&#39;s probably a good idea to keep your restaurant clean.Menu<br />\nCreating a menu seems simple, but a poorly thought-out menu is the death of many restaurants. Pick your dishes carefully and make sure they are the right price.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-24T03:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/427/427021ca76fdf4b39c23dacb22ab8d54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jelle Booij"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jelle Booij"], "esrb_rating": null}
