It is an autobiographical representation of some of my experiences being\u00a0mentally ill.</p><p>Everybody experiences mental illness and trauma differently. This game is representative of some of my experiences, and no one else's. I make no claim to represent a universal experience of mental illness or trauma, but, rather, just one manifestation of these things.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger warnings:</strong> discussion of trauma and triggers, eating disorders, OCD, depression, misophonia, victim-blame and self-blame. Vague mention of a specific\u00a0childhood trauma (though no details are given, there are several common interpretations, most of which involve abuse of some kind). Representation and inclusion\u00a0of eating disorder-, OCD-, misophonia-, and trauma-related triggers.</p>\n<p><strong>Please play at a resolution of 1280 by 720.\u00a0</strong>Best played with headphones, but that's just my opinion.<br/></p>\n<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on the game.</p>\n\n<p>In playing the game, you may encounter some covers (by me) of the following songs:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Big Bird,\" \"Temple Grandin Too,\" and \"Love in the Time of Human Papillomavirus\" by AJJ</li><li>\"Told Ya So\" by Adult Mom</li><li>\"Appointments\" by Julien Baker</li><li>\"You Could Be Happy\" by Snow Patrol</li><li>\"Wonderwall\" by Oasis</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ae/8ae8de0df0eeac59e72f7c867085d8f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Violet Elder"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
