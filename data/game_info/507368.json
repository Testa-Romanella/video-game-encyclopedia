You jump and move right automatically, the only thing you can control is your speed.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold [SPACE] to go faster, release to go slower. Try to land on the safe numbers.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Press [R] to restart the game if you fail.</li></ul>\n<p>Fun fact: It would take approximately 8 hours to get through every 100 000 Pi decimals hardcoded in the game files. After that, the game will probably crash. It would be crazy to even <em>imagine </em>attempting it. <strong>Just don't. </strong><em>(But if you do please record it)</em></p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Born2BeSporty font by JapanYoshi, Sound effects by JavierZumer and BeezleFM.
