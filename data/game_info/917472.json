There is a problem though as the suitcase's latch is busted and the body keeps spilling out. Not to mention you are riding on a train and are sharing a sleeping car\u00a0with a\u00a0young widow. Don't let her see it.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few different paths you can take that will lead to different results. Talk with the widow. Don't let the body fall out. Try not to continuously fool with your suitcase as it may draw more attention that you'd like.</p>\n\n<p>This is a short game made for the\u00a0Neophyte Studios Narrative Game Jam.</p>\n<p>(There is an occasional glitch where the game gets stuck and the conversation doesn't progress. This is pretty rare, but needs a restart if it does happen.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T10:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2ab2d602faf822cc7f817126ce85bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrainGuts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
