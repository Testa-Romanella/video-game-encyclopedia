One that you have never seen before. One that requires living keys. And if it weren't for the hunger growing in your gut, you wouldn't be so desperate to solve this. ALGAE puts you in a race against time where you must not only balance your growing hunger and changing body, but do it all before you lose your only bastion of hope. Your humanity.\u00a0</p><p>Based on the Wretched and Alone SRD and submitted to the Wretched Game Jam, ALGAE follows the same themes of darkness, despair, and isolation.\u00a0<br/><br/></p><p>----</p><p>ALGAE is currently a work in progress and is being updated with further endings and more content as you read this.
