{"id": 56061, "slug": "geist", "name": "Geist", "name_original": "Geist", "description": "<p>Geist (stylized as geist) is a first-person action-adventure video game for the Nintendo GameCube, released on August 15, 2005, in North America; on October 7, 2005, in Europe; and on November 3, 2005; in Australia.<br />\nA prototype of the game was developed by n-Space, who approached Nintendo to be the game&#39;s publisher. Nintendo accepted, making Geist the second GameCube game published by Nintendo to receive an M-rating (the first being Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#39;s Requiem). In the following years, Nintendo and n-Space worked closely on Geist. The game was first shown at the E3 2003 and was announced to be part of the GameCube&#39;s line-up for 2003. However, it was delayed multiple times, making it two years of delay for fine-tuning. During that time, the game&#39;s genre changed from first-person shooter to first-person action-adventure with second-person elements. The Geist franchise is owned by Nintendo, due to their contract with n-Space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-30T09:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f7d/f7db4ff4ae9c2828691d282bd2a60435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 448, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Nintendo", "n-Space"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
