Use your lantern and matches to illuminate your path, avoiding traps and creatures hiding in the dark.</p>\n\n<p>Light is great for showing the path ahead, but it also reveals you to anything hiding in the shadows. Balance your use of light and darkness\u00a0to navigate forward through the cave. Be careful to not run out of matches for your lantern\u00a0though...<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Note: I forgot to put a sign explaining the left clicking with the lantern can light objects and hold back the roaming enemy. So. Left click please?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Christoph Jakob</p>\n<p>Everything else:\u00a0Alex Hallee</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Rotate: QE</p>\n<p>Interact (w/o lantern): Left Click</p>\n<p>Light Objects/Push Back Monsters (w/ lantern): Left Click</p>\n<p>Relight Lantern (if lantern extinguished): Left Click</p>\n<p>Extinguish Lantern: Space</p>\n<p>Free-Look: Hold Right Click\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab00b299822bdf9354303f852feb51b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Halleester"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
