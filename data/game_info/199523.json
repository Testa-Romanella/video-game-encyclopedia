If you are in the air gravity will pull you down but if you are in the water you will get pushed to the surface. Try to get a good flow going in order to make it through as many tubes before time runs out, But make sure to watch out for planes and fish!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0 Space bar (This will push you either up or down depending on whether or not you are in the air or in the water)</p>\n<p>This was my first game jam and it was a lot of fun. Thank you GMTK for putting this together and thank you Kimber and Wes for doing the art.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c91/c91646b11f481e08fdfcdf0c9cf656be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drew1888"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
