Now you have to expel all demons from purgatory. To do this you will have to make use of rocks, moving them conveniently, to pile them up or fill in gaps, break blocks of earth to open your way or transport yourself through doors, all while avoiding falling into a hole that will prevent you from finishing the level. Help Death to solve the challenges of getting rid of the daemons in each level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d88/d88d10d109894597dc146d24bb09c603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rubo Factory"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
