Struggle to build a base and gear-up in the hostile environment. Defend yourself from wildlife and AI hunters (who also build bases in the world). Progress your base technology for advanced item crafting and upgrades. Farm crops,  raise small animals and harvest and refine resources to rise in dominance in the world. If you enjoy open-world sandbox survival games, resource gathering and grinding to build a base, you may enjoy playing the early access version of the game.Current features:<em> Singleplayer sandbox experience (the multiplayer component is in development)<br />\n</em> Crafting mechanics.<br />\n<em> Dynamic base building.<br />\n</em> Weapon upgrade system.<br />\n<em> Mining and refining of ores.<br />\n</em> AI Hunters (with AI base building).<br />\n<em> Farming.<br />\n</em> Animal husbandry.<br />\n<em> Food cooking mechanics.<br />\n</em> World day-night cycle.<br />\n<em> Temperature change based on time-of-day and altitude.<br />\n</em> Character hunger/thirst/strength mechanics.<br />\n<em> Character clothing system.<br />\n</em> System for inviting/removing players to access bases.<br />\n<em> Central power system for bases (base items require power to function).<br />\n</em> Npc enemy leveling system.DISCLAIMER (PLEASE READ):The public Early Access is intended for those interested in supporting the project and participating in it&#39;s continued development. You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend allowing some time before trying out the game. There are many YouTube game-plays showing the current state of game. I am the sole developer of the project, which I work  on in my spare time as a passion project. I feel this is important to mention, so that those considering playing the game can make a more informed purchase decision. A full detailed list of the updates since launch can be viewed here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/allnews/.Goals of the project:The aim is to integrate the kinds of base-resource micro-management typically found in RTS titles, into a boots-on-the-ground shooter. Each base has an underlying economy of power and raw materials that must be maintained and expanded in order to rise in dominance.<br />\nThe focus is not of primitive survival (although there are many elements during the early-game), but instead a focus on the base, its security, technology and resources.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-23T22:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f5998146efbf8bad3e7811b5af2e97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 86, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 505, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["KANGAROO GAMES", "ColdGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["KANGAROO GAMES", "ColdGames"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
