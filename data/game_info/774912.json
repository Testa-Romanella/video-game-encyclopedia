I really like this game idea, so I plan on finishing it after the CCGJ ends.\u00a0 I've included the test scene with base mechanics, but the game itself is not finished yet. Making a game solo is very hard but I had a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>After being sent to the depths of Hell for your crimes against humanity with your creations, you are eternally chased by hellspawn and must find a way out. You were never strong physically, but as a genius engineer, you can make creations to fight for you. Build your army using the parts of your enemies and escape from hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Built in Hell is a roguelike 2D dungeon-crawler that focuses on creating machines from the parts of your enemies to fight for you.\u00a0As you make your way out, deal with the devil to upgrade your machines permanently. At the end of each level, you are offered a choice of unique upgrades that will change how you play each time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T06:13:41", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["big-jungus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
