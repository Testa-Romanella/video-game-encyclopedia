Our goal is to get as high as possible, avoiding spikes and various obstacles. Think carefully about your next move, any mistake can cost you a lot of nerves and time. The higher you are, the further you can fall.<h3>Various levels</h3><br/><br/>Each next level is different from the previous one. With each new level you will come across more difficult jumps and more difficult obstacles.<h3>Physics</h3><br/><br/>Make the best use of physics. Sometimes it's worth bouncing off something to get somewhere. Unfortunately, gravity will not be your friend.<h3>Traps and obstacles</h3><br/><br/>Avoid traps like fire. Death is not at hand. Why die and pass a level again?<h3>Skins for the Player</h3><br/><br/>There are a lot of skins available for the player in the game, you just need to find them. Everyone will find something for themselves.<h3>Save Points</h3><br/><br/>There are Save Points at the beginning of each level. Sometimes it is worth taking more time to move to the next Save Point than repeat the level the next day. If you fall below the current Save Point, your Save Point will automatically reset to the previous one.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Features of the game: </h3></strong><br/>\u2022 Challenging gameplay<br/>\u2022 Nice pixel graphics<br/>\u2022 Amazing player physics<br/>\u2022 Various obstacles<br/>\u2022 Challenging jumps<br/>\u2022 A game for every age group<br/>\u2022 Game saving system<br/>\u2022 Personalization of the player's appearance<br/>\u2022 Unlimited time to pass the level, no stress", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T02:31:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/501/501feb0eb5163a9ee7416b6c5ad74854.jpg", "website": "https://www.coresaken.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coresaken"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coresaken"], "esrb_rating": null}
