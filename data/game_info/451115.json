I may fix it in the future after I finish the games I am currently making, but I am kinda appalled by the code I wrote for it so there is also a chance I will just remake the whole thing.</p>\n<p>How it fits with the theme of \"Trust No One\": In this game you are unable to trust your troops staying on your side as there is a chance the enemy will bribe them. You can also bribe enemy troops to your side.</p>\n\n<p>How to play (provided since I was unable to even start on the tutorial):</p>\n<p>-Locate your Command Center(has a dark green flag).</p>\n<p>-Click it and create a builder.</p>\n<p>-Create some buildings to make units.</p>\n<p>-Make units and send them towards the enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d7234c5879ca414dd5d819fdf19e4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
