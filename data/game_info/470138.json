On Saturday night,\u00a0my wife had experienced loss of control of her phone due to children and I\u00a0joked about how it's a like a game. When the kids were in bed, I\u00a0kept thinking about that simple game idea and I decided to give it a try! When I saw that it fit the theme, I signed up to include it in the jam. I was caught by surprise by the 8 pm\u00a0<strong>UK</strong>\u00a0<strong>time</strong> deadline, but managed to get something playable anyway.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my lovely wife who helped keep my kids from trying to \"help\" me type as I game jammed. She supports me when I'm motivated\u00a0and encourages me when I'm down.\u00a0I dedicate this project to her.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T07:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98aa69ac0529438cd62ccb88b45b1e7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["idbrii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
