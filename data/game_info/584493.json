This will cause\u00a0the game (maybe even your computer)\u00a0to lag.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the third puzzle is\u00a0 unsolvable due to this bug.\u00a0We're sorry about the issue!</p>\n<p>Update: The bug is solved!- but submissions have since closed an hour ago. For a little background, basically the direction vector and start position\u00a0of the laser needed to compensate for the\u00a0rotation of the body it is on. After the judging period ends, we will be quick to upload the new version :).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Character Controls<br/></strong>Movement: 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'<br/>Interaction: 'E', 'space', or 'enter'</p>\n<p><strong>Puzzle Controls</strong><br/>Rotate element: left/right arrow keys<br/>Open mirrors: up/down arrow keys</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong><br/>- If you don't know what to do, go to the top floor and read the display</p>\n<p>- To recreate a signal, direct the correct color beam to the laser receptacle at the top of the board<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Our Vision</strong><br/>It started from talking about\u00a0that moment from the Lord of the Rings movies where the protagonists light the bonfire at the top of the city- and you watch as the far off mountainside camps light their fires to repeat the signal . That feeling of making a symbolic connection while being one small part of whole was what we wanted to capture in our game. This was translated into our 'after-humans' world where relics of their communications systems, the \"beacons\",\u00a0 were left decaying with their robot operators idle. That is until, a beacon recognizes a signal in the distance and reactivates to\u00a0relay this mysterious message across the remaining towers...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dev notes</strong><br/>We really\u00a0wish we could have added more before the deadline, but we are nevertheless fairly\u00a0pleased with this ambitious idea. We intended to add so much more story and nuance, but that will have to wait until after the jam (as is usually the case).\u00a0By far, this game took the most effort compared to all of\u00a0our 1-week projects to this point. Please enjoy and let us know what you think!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Code/Puzzle Design: Kyle Lim (De Anza College)<br/>Art/Sound Design: Zachary Delgros\u00a0\u00a0(De Anza College)<br/>CC0 Sound Effects: freesound.org<br/>Parallax Title Background: opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b3150d20745807bcac75686b36aed18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Studio Haiku"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
