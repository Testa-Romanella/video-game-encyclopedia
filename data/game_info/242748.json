I had some results but it wasn't so satisfactory to me...</p>\n<p>Based on the first game of the series Alone in the Dark, I was modelling some characters and a lot of things of this game inside Blender. All these assets I modelled became interesting for a game in my opinion, so I'm looking to do a point'n click adventure game.</p>\n<p>I'm struggling a little with programming, but I'm studying to start to do nice things on Unity. Besides Unity, I still need to work on more animations for each action that the characters can do inside the game and also the voice overing of the characters. (maybe something more simple as the dialogues of many adventure games on N64 or something more cheap using Text to Speech...)</p>\n<p>There are a lot of stuff to do here, but I'm leaving a prototype of what I made until now. A lot of bugs, glitches, textures missing are expected, there is no sound yet, just a dream and a bunch of vertices.</p>\n<p>If you have something to say about, your comments are welcome here.<br/>(PS: Coment\u00e1rios em Portugu\u00eas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o bem vindos aqui)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/6749c51266617a17b21582dd8bdc438e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DenicioC"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
