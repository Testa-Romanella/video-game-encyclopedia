What are the goals of the Bokurobo? How were they born in the first place? These mysteries will gradually become clear as the game progresses.<br/>Each Bokurobo has a different behavior pattern and has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the battle situation. By understanding their nature and placing them appropriately, you will be able to take advantage of the battle.<h3>Changing Bodies, Growing Cores</h3>The \"Core\" of a Bokurobo starts to move when a \"body\" is attached to it. Since the body is gradually damaged, the core periodically replaces the body.<br/>The basic performance of the Bokurobo is determined by the body, but as the battle progresses, the core itself is upgraded according to the characteristics of the body.<br/>By systematically switching bodies, unique Bokurobo can be created, such as \"an offensive Bokurobo that opens up the battle with high firepower\" or \"a support Bokurobo that is strong in the face of a battle.<h3>Powerful Power Overclock</h3>While the battle of the Bokurobo proceeds automatically, the player is the only one who can intervene with the command to activate the \"Overclock\".<br/>Overclock, as the name implies, is a trump card that, by placing a high load on the Bokurobo , can produce powerful effects such as a general attack or a significant increase in its status. Although it has the disadvantage of significantly damaging the body of the activated Bokurobo , it is powerful enough to change the entire war situation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T07:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/77655f795b0b1e234ac13ae74db3bfe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matsu friends"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["matsu friends"], "esrb_rating": null}
