We have developed a flexible open source game engine (the OpenRA engine) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the OpenRA mods).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe OpenRA mods include new features and gameplay improvements that bring them into the modern era:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A choice between \"right click\" and classic \"left click\" control schemes</li>\n<li>Overhauled sidebar interfaces for managing production</li>\n<li>Support for game replays and an observer interface designed for streaming games online</li>\n<li>The \"fog of war\" that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight</li>\n<li>Civilian structures that can be captured to provide benefits</li>\n<li>Units gain experience as they fight and improve when they earn new ranks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tOpenRA is 100% free, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game assets, or you can use the original game disks.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-21T07:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f561945475c171c683404ca0243a2c1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 463, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["openra"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
