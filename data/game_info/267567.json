Other backgrounds painted with pencil and marker in the same year.<br/>The operation is simple, there are several levels to overcome. Drive our hero and pick up his magic stick to eliminate the evil creatures trying to stop him from passing. Some objects can be collected to increase your power.<br/>At the end of each level you will find a boss difficult to eliminate. Be quick and smart to end it.<br/>Note: It is not a children's adventure and has some difficulty.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/769/769d449ebe492d778d72f6a1252c3459_2kXv5RM.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Francisco Javier Perez"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Francisco Javier Perez"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
