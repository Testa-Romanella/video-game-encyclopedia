{"id": 490230, "slug": "the-future-is-bright", "name": "The Future is Bright!", "name_original": "The Future is Bright!", "description": "<p>What is it like to be an average citizen living in the Imperium of Man?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not an imperial guard fighting xenos or an inquisitor battling daemons, but your average human living in the Lower Hive of a massive Hive City.\u00a0The place where most of us live in the 42nd millenium. Billions are born, work hard their entire lives, and die without ever seeing the sky.\u00a0This is what countless millenia of war has given us.\u00a0Welcome to the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a Warhammer 40k fangame that allows you to wander around in what I imagine the lower hive of a Hive City would look like. As of now, there is only the level to explore; no pick-ups or enemies. However, I would like to add more eventually. For now, this is just an early access look at this vision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are the usual; move with wasd and look with mouse. You can also sprint with shift. While in-game, press esc or p to pause the game and\u00a0x to end the game entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The level doesn't really have an \"end\" but once you reach the Church, that's as much of the world as I have created. Feel free to look around it though; it's one of the most complicated parts of the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Look forward to the next update:</p>\n<p>-Potential audio logs</p>\n<p>-A manufactorium</p>\n<p>-Maybe some sections of the Underhive?\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Ideally some interactable set-pieces</p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think! The game is in its infancy but support may help it grow into something worth while. Also, if you have any ideas of what you think a Hive City would look like on the inside, let me know that too!\u00a0Inspiration is what fuels this machine.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e43fba33e8a7e10126900c9717d8c88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MisterPassenger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
