The theme is Future Jam, so I decided to make a game about robots- <em>set in the future.</em></p>\n<p><strong>=============================================</strong></p>\n<p>Help a bot make friends by solving small puzzles with his trusty magnet. Can a robot make friends? Features 4 levels and cute bots!</p>\n<p><strong>=============================================</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first ever game jam project (that isn't for RPG Maker, and the one I joined was technically more of a contest), and not only that but also my first project where I worked with a partner! It's nothing objectively special, but I hope there something you find enjoyable or interesting about our game. Have fun! :)</p>\n<p><strong>=============================================</strong></p>\n<p>Note: <em>The browser version does not perform as well as the executable- if you want to experience the best version of this game, feel free to download the actual game.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d6ed6e0683b5cb3ea4c927959183ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Percarus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
