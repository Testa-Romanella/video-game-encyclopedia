Sounds easy enough right? There are seagulls flying overhead and ghost crabs that will stop at nothing to take you down.  Find the best path around the crabs through nine levels (more levels to come)\u00a0and get to the end. Collect as many shells as you can to get to the end. \r\n </p>\n<p>Talk to the other sea turtles on the way.</p>\n<p>Low on health? Interact (Hi-Star)\u00a0\u00a0with the starfish.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0D-Pad = To move the turtle up and down and all around.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of collectibles in the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Seashells: These will give you one (shell) point.</p>\n<p> Conch shells : These will give you four (shell) points.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Ghost crab: This little guy will team up with his buddies to come after you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Seagull: Enemy, sometimes frenemy. Seagulls fly horizontally in the game but if a crab is in its path, its bye bye crab. It works the same way with the turtle.\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0Whirlpools: Stay away from them as they will cause some major pain to the turtle.\r\n\n<p>I do have a few ideas planned but more on that at a later date. If people are\u00a0interested, I can start posting devlogs.</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\r\nCheck out my interview with GantProdux of Tiny Yellow Machine: A Playdate show\u00a0 right here.\r\n</p>\n<p>Comments, questions, bugs etc. are appreciated.\r\n</p>\n<p>To sideload a game to the Playdate, refer to this\u00a0link.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T16:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f13493d058385247967dddd135449264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XaniaLasagna"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
