The number on the dice defines your role. And when you roll in combat,\u00a0 then your role (class) changes. Submitted as part of the 2022 GMTK Game Jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<ul><li>Make it to the end of the board! Watch out for the enemy! The red bar represents your health. Run out of health and you have to start over!</li><li>You can roll when you have full meter. You can overcharge your meter to see what your next role will be.\u00a0</li><li>You can charge meter over time, or by using Dice. Pick up Dice in the world, and then Consume them to instantly gain full meter. Consuming a dice while already at full meter will \"reroll\" your next role, so you will turn into the role represented to the right of the blue bar.\u00a0</li><li>You can store up to three dice. Picking up additional dice after the third will automatically consume it.</li><li>If you try to roll without meter, but you have a dice, you will roll and expend one of your dice.</li><li>Rolling also heals you!</li><li>Press ESC or Select to quit the game.</li></ul>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p>\n<ul><li>Paladin, Thief, and Lancer cannot attack right now.</li><li>Wizard's Lightning Bolt isn't working, but the animation is playing.\u00a0</li><li>Ranger's arrows don't have working textures.
