Your Health is your currency so be careful! <br/></p>\n<p>This prototype was created for a Staffordshire university games jam that spanned over 2 days with a team of 5. My role was creating the designs and ideas for the game such as genre, main gameplay loop, ideas for weapons, traps and pathing for the enemies. This jam was useful as it taught me a good lesson on checking on time constraints and keeping the project aligned with those limits as many features and fixes were not implemented due to running out of time.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out the game and my work on the designs as well! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99ef0aebacbda6f27e4f81c27ebe28fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePurist"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
