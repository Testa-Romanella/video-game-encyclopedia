They are remakes of great classics from the Amiga 500 computer:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Roller Maze (remake of Rock'n'Rol)</strong>: guide a ball through a perilous maze to the exit\r\n</li><li><strong>Lemurs (remake of Lemmings)</strong>: help a horde of lemurs to survive and find a new home by giving them orders\r\n</li><li><strong>Oil Tycoon (remake of Black Gold / Oil Imperium)</strong>: manage an oil company - buy land, sell oil, and cheat on the other players\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The games are almost feature complete and stay as true as possible to their inspirations. At the moment, Lemurs features 2 levels and Roller Maze 3 levels but more are in the works and will be added over time. I am also thinking about a method for importing\u00a0your own levels later on.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in how these games were made and want to make similar games, you can find the Unity project for them in the Asset Store:\u00a0Retro Remakes Project in the Asset Store</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c6e9aeabd715b0f9109078329059e7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olipool"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
