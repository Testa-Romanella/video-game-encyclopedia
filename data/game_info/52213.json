After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he&#39;s sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.<br />\nDusty is Rad&#39;s good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn&#39;t what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!<br />\nRad &amp; Dusty&#39;s adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun.
