Use air currents to move across the map faster, and pick your targets well.</p>\n<p>NPCs have defense scores that are based on the real life transmission rates, and by attacking them, you further whittle away at their defense, until you can infect them. Of course, just like in real life, that isn't the only factor that affects their defense. Wearing a mask grants them a significant boost in defense; and if they break\u00a0social distancing, they put themselves at greater risk, thus further lowering their defenses.</p>\n\n<p>Made for the Jamming The Curve jam.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD: Move</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>Left Click: Attack</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Co-Developed by Spartano46 and sevrc1136</p>\n<p>Cut and Run by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3576-cut-and-run<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Splat/Squish 1 by mricky13\u00a0<br/>License: CC0<br/>Link: https://freesound.org/people/mrickey13/sounds/515618/</p>\n<p>Squish impact by Bertsz<br/>License: CC0<br/>Link: https://freesound.org/people/Bertsz/sounds/500912/</p>\n<p>double_cough_01 by joedeshon<br/>License: CC Attribution<br/>Link: https://freesound.org/people/joedeshon/sounds/266019/</p>\n<p>Toony Tiny People Demo by Polygon Blacksmith<br/>License: Extension Asset<br/>Link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/toony-tiny-people-demo-11318...</p>\n<p>Coat of arms high contrast icon by Xavigivax<br/>License: CC Atribution 4.0 International<br/>Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_high_contrast_icon.svg</p>\n<p>Stay safe, and as always, any feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58efe5be45f0972a84ac0facfc598541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spartano46", "sevrc1136"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
