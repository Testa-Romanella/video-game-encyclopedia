The idea behind the game had been with me for a long time before that though. </p>\n<p>The basic idea is that every level is supposed to be a different game playable on it\u2019s own. Games with very diverse gameplay are hard to find, so I always wanted to create a game like that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T17:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe5d52fef0a48914f0378d953b1e4e6.JPG", "website": "https://archive.org/details/RevengeOfTheSunfish", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
