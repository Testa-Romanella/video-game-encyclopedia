The game itself was made on the basis of one thing. Using assets from the Macintosh 1984 system, which means black and white in color and no sound. The students were  able to achieve this, by the use of simple assets and simple yet fun game play and a very limited color pallet. Guardians of Kirkyard, only has three objectives in mind. To Climb the tower, defeat as many enemies that stand in your way, and to defeat the final boss at the top of the tower.  We hope that you enjoy your journey through our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T03:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58ca87ad5b460983c4d229e174c27466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Horizion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
