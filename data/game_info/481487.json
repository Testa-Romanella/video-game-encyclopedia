Basically instead of the \"Gameboy\" it's the \"FameGirl\". Just cause the \"Lameboy\" is kind of overused.<br/><br/>Learned a whole butt load in the process. But, through thick and thin, we got it produced. It was definitely challenging to say the least. <br/><br/>We're never gonna stop pumping out games. And we guarantee we will do everything we can to continue to increase the value of what we put out. Let us know what you think of the project. Also stop by our Patreon. We're still getting that up and running, but it would mean the world to have some people see the potential we know we have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/invadetechsoftware<br/></p>\n<p>Also, we're looking to work with other developers as well. We'd be extremely excited to grow and be able to get even more amazing content out. So get in touch with us and let's work together.<br/></p>\n<p>Music by:<br/></p>\n<p>All Green by Jasson Prestiliano (JP Soundworks)<br/>Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY 3.0 <br/></p>\n\n<p>Track Name: \"Better Days\"<br/>Music By: LAKEY INSPIRED @ https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired<br/>Official \"LAKEY INSPIRED\" YouTube Channel HERE -\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy...<br/>License for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0) License.<br/>Full License HERE - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...<br/>Music promoted by NCM https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac99058f333827eeb27db2b40b23a3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invade Tech Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
