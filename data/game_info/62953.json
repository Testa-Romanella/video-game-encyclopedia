{"id": 62953, "slug": "malfortune", "name": "Malfortune", "name_original": "Malfortune", "description": "Malfortune is an increasingly challenging series of boss fights where you can choose to kill or spare each foe you defeat. But be warned, the deaths of these figures WILL have an effect on the world around you. Each enemy you face embodies some aspect of the world, such as luck, fear, or joy. Killing these \"essences,\" as they come to be called, will cause people and bosses to treat you differently, and may even affect you directly. You can choose to show no mercy and absorb special abilities from the fallen gods, or spare the people and essences of the world out of the kindness of your heart.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, though. No amount of kindness will cause the essences to show you any mercy. You're an outsider to this world, and (the way they see it) you have to be stopped. Otherwise, bad things could happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>At least 3 distinct endings and \"moderate\" replayability!<br/></li><li>Original art and music that some are calling \"passable!\"<br/></li><li>Various secrets and details littering the world!<br/></li><li>A hollow planet, with double the surfaces to explore of a regular planet!<br/></li><li>Created ENTIRELY by one person!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5a54278090d20244d6e34b3b32bb72.jpg", "website": "https://andyimm.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andy Imm"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Restful Panic"], "esrb_rating": null}
