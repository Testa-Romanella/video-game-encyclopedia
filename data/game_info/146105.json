I made this on construct 3 in my spare time during programing class, and I wanted to share it. It was originally made for phones, until I found out that costs money, which I don't have. Don't feel obligated to donate, though I don't discourage such. I heavily encourage comments, especially constructive criticism, any if other game developers see this, I hope to be like you one day.</p>\n<p>Controls- <strong>click the mouse</strong> or<strong> hit the space bar</strong> to jump, should also support controllers, I haven't tested that part yet.<br/></p>\n\n<p>BTW- the music was composed on ear sketch by me</p>\n\n<p>Business Email - TheBamLord01@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43a/43a84e4f2a9f1862cf687c2f522b26f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheBamLord01"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
