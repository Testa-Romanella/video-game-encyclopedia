I started development on May 1st and ended on May 31st. So this is more of a prototype of a game and I'd love to hear your feedback!</p>\n<p>In Construct, you choose a summoner and summon creatures called Constructs. The constructs move across the battlefield and attack any other constructs in the way. The goal is to defeat the other summoner.</p>\n<p>This game was created with Unity 3D. I created all the assets using Blender and Photoshop.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the development, I have a devlog here:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLEe2RvjKQXDlJsNfEjW_A/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75de1e141f2f87b027fda0414318bc0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garrett Kearney"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
