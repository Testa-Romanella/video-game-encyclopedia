You can play football (soccer) as a gorilla. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe locomotion is inspired by Gorilla Tag. You can run, jump, and hit the ball using only your hands. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe rules are the same as football. There are several game modes, including single mode, penalty shootout mode, corner kick mode and multiplayer. You can not only play with bots, but also play with other players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is easy to play, but hard to master. It maybe helps to actually play football. It's a kind of fitness because it takes much exercise.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T05:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e5033c66ea9f19e5a1fcfd136c4831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fengu Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Fengu Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
