{"id": 707296, "slug": "perfect-heist-2", "name": "Perfect Heist 2", "name_original": "Perfect Heist 2", "description": "In this game, one robber team tries to <strong>steal money</strong> and other goods from a bank while <strong>trying not to get noticed by the cop team</strong>. The cops have a big advantage in fighting, so <strong>keeping a low profile and blending in with the crowd</strong> is critical for the robbers. Wait for the perfect moment to knock out one of the employees to use his clothes as a disguise while <strong>sneaking, drilling, bombing, or hacking your way to the loot</strong>! <br/><br/>There are <strong>32 completely different classes</strong> to choose from, with different abilities, weapon loadouts, and passive perks. All guns of the first part are included in this game, as well as lots of exciting new weapons like a rocket launcher, different types of grenade launchers, and much more for a total of over 20 unique weapons!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Every aspect of the game got reworked from the ground up, with much<strong> smoother gunplay</strong>, greatly <strong>improved net code</strong>, more user-friendly UI, and exciting new classes and gameplay aspects like destructible walls. Due to third-person mode allowing for players to look around walls in a stealth-based game, the first-person mode was a big focus in development, with refined weapon animations and smooth movement, but a third-person mode is also included as a server setting!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There will also be a<strong> level system</strong>, <strong>unlockable cosmetics</strong>, and a <strong>level editor with Steam Workshop integration</strong>, so you can create your own maps or play on community-made maps which complement the five included maps, with three being completely new, and one being a reworked and polished map from the first part. There will also be more official maps and custom map contests in the future!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T05:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3f/c3fb2f61cfff4ae25272554627ca1935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 54, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["yeswecamp"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["yeswecamp"], "esrb_rating": null}
