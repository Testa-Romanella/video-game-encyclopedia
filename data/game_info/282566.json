This arcade style game is made to be quick, simple, and addictive like the old-school\u00a0arcade games that inspired it. You play as a ninja in Medieval Japan that is tasked with freeing castles that have been overrun with monsters and saving the nobility\u00a0that are trapped inside. It won't be easy though, monsters will spawn endlessly until the goal score of that floor is met meaning the faster you score points the better chance you have to survive. Each castle has a boss at the top waiting to be slain. How many castles can you save? Can you get the high score?</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>Start: Enter key</p><p>Move: WASD keys</p><p>Shoot: Enter Key</p><p>Quit Game: Esc Key</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f527a7f3585c98478d3fe5fd7a80d63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pig & Hippo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
