A MEDITATION AND MEDIATION BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND THE VIRTUAL SELF", "description": "<p>Working with virtual reality, a question that never left my head was  how I myself could enter the sphere of virtual reality. A pretty banal,  but much needed step for that was to bring my body, the real-life home  for my feelings, emotions and thoughts, into the virtual. This step of  translating my body and its movements into virtual reality quickly  became the focal point of my interest. Theoretically, I approached this  project in the framework of out-of-body experiences coupled with  embodiment. The first attempt to translate my body into an avatar was  done by working with Pifuhd, a script that creates a 3d model based on a  picture. The avatar I got from this was proportionally pretty close to  how I see my body, although my face seemed unfamiliar \u2013 a kind of  disassociation just with the face.     </p>\n<p>The second attempt seemed promising: Photogrammetry. However, the  result was disappointing: An avatar without hands, with a hole in the  stomach and a face barely recognizable. After multiple explorations of  those two processes, I was left with what I am calling my failed avatars  \u2013 models that originated from myself but lost (or gained?) something in  the translation. Only the third attempt, a mix between the FACEBUILDER  plug-in for blender and a makehuman model, yielded an avatar that I  could truly identify with in the virtual.     </p>\n<p>As a crucial part of translating not only my physical body into the  virtual but more so my whole self, I also experimented with motion  capture, with the aim of intensifying the identification of myself with  my avatar. Through this process, the question arose, if there would be  any way to consolidate with my failed avatars through exploring them  with my motions and through facilitating and promoting virtual  out-of-body experiences.    I chose to write a meditation to facilitate this exchange between the  physical and the virtual. You can download the experience to try  yourself (you will need a Kinect to take part) or watch the  documentation of myself having the experience.</p>\n\n<p>Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kim1iTU=/\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\r\nby Larissa Gross</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T10:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f92ee0d00d5ee1606d3eb100e7b4ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["larissamariagross"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
