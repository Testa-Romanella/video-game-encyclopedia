You play as a hunter and your goal is to defeat the final boss.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>\n<p>* <strong>Stamina-based combat</strong> where your actions consume a portion of your stamina. Your stamina regenerates automatically.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Invincibility during dash</strong>. While dashing your character won't take any damage, use dash for invincibility as it is crucial to defeat the game.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Terror</strong>. When your character is hurt terror will build up reducing your vision and stamina regeneration.</p>\n<p>EDIT: The builds have been updated post-jam to add an extra boss attack and some sound effects. Unfortunately the original jam builds got replaced automatically when uploading the new ones.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Keyboard controls</em><br/></p>\n<p>Move: A/D</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Attack: J</p>\n<p>Dash: Shift</p>\n\n<p><em>Gamepad controls (Xbox)</em></p>\n<p>Move: Left Stick</p>\n<p>Jump: A</p>\n<p>Attack: X</p>\n<p>Dash: Right Trigger (R2)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:53:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84bf659b6c3cf0d5348391fb28c89e07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["oikonomopo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
