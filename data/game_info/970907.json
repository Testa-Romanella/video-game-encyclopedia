Players direct an avatar through a series of mazes.  Each maze differs in size, theme, and difficulty.  As they maneuver the maze, players search for clues to a puzzle.  Each puzzle goes along with the theme of the associated maze.  Each puzzle also differs in type and complexity.  The clues could lead to a four digit combination that will be needed to exit the maze.  A few of the puzzles are easy, but some are down-right difficult.  This game was meant to be both entertaining and challenging.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T23:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08bf9c134e6748e3be7cd87726f9308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GJ Arts"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["GJ Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
