A horde of viruses took over your folder and is threatening every single file in there. Once they destroyed everything and came for you, you busted out of your besieged house, grabbed a pistol, and started to kill those viruses. You fought through streets of bloody corpses until you found a city hall, where the army is. But when you came there, a gigantic tank has already destroyed them all. You destroyed that monstrosity and headed out. Something caught your eyes. You saw a flying hovercraft controlled by viruses. It is also the safe haven for viruses, where they can plan out their next moves. You infiltrated the hovercraft and completely annihilated the virus forces inside and destroyed it. You then received some signals from survivors. They told you that they captured and reinforced a train station that might help you and them to escape from the infested city. You fought tons of viruses before climbing onto the train, only to find the survivors dead on the floor. You escaped the city, but suddenly, a monstrosity of a robot stopped you. It is actually the robot shell of the anomaly that destroyed your hometown with it\u2019s insidious and it\u2019s disgusting viruses. The anomaly told you that it was betrayed by the computer and wanted to get revenge. So it turned itself and many other files into\u00a0 viruses and invaded the computer, starting with your file. You fought and killed the merciless and heartless monster with a blast from your trusty, newfound tank, and escaped the city with it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/354e071c163e7fef585e2802f41c297a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MindX - Technology & Startup school"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
