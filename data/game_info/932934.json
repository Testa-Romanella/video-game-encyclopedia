The theme of the jam is\u00a0Fast &amp; Slow</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to download stuff before getting caught. The player can change the download speed to make the game faster or slower.</p>\n<p>Space: Start the game. Restart after Game Over.</p>\n<p>A/D: Move the catcher at the bottom to catch folders and avoid viruses</p>\n<p>Up/Down: Increase or Decrease the download speed to make the game faster or slower. A high speed is more risky, a slow speed is safer but be careful not to run out of time.</p>\n<p>Catch FOLDERS to complete the DOWNLOAD (bottom meter) and go to the next level.</p>\n<p>Catching too many VIRUSES will break your FIREWALL and cause a negative effect that makes the level harder.</p>\n<p>The ALERT meter (top meter)\u00a0increases over time and when you miss folders. If it fills you will be sued by copyright lawyers and the game is over.</p>\n<p>There are also WATCHED folders which will increase ALERT when you catch them</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:<br/>Enesai - Artist</p>\n<p>HenrikEhde - Designer &amp; Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ee/0ee3c7971572f1d8bc00a5290b03a1f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HenrikEhde"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
