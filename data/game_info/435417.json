{"id": 435417, "slug": "midnight-technician", "name": "Midnight Technician", "name_original": "Midnight Technician", "description": "<p>Work your night shift from 12 AM - 6 AM to keep the terminals up and running. If they run out of power, you lose! Can you beat all 3 difficulites?</p>\n<p>There are 4 terminals to keep track of. Charge a terminal by walking up to it and left clicking. Every time you charge a terminal, your risk meter rises. The risk meter shows the % chance of a terminal breaking down the next time you charge it. When a terminal breaks down, you need to go to your bench and grab your wrench with right click. Walk back to the terminal, fix it, put your wrench away and get back to charging as fast as you can!</p>\n<p>There are also many powerups that spawn in the room. The clock freezes the terminal with the lowest charge for 10 seconds, the POW cube doubles your charge power for 10 seconds, and the battery instantly refills the charge of every terminal. Managing your powerups and using them at the right time is essential to getting through the night, especially on harder difficulties. There are also many interesting interactions between powerups, eg, freezing a broken terminal instantly repairs it so you don't need to get your wrench.</p>\n<p>From the start you have easy mode and hard mode unlocked. Beating them gives you 1 star each. Once you get 2 stars, you unlock impossible mode. I'm pretty sure that impossible mode is actually impossible without an autoclicker/insanely unobtainable godlike luck, but I would love for somebody to prove me wrong. When you beat impossible mode you unlock the 3rd star, and have 100% completed the game. Stars automatically save at the end of each night.</p>\n<p>Game made by me, BillehBawb.
