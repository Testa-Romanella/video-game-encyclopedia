She has feelings for the man standing in her street --not a stalker-- who's just loitering about --definitely not a stalker-- and who occasionally tries to look through her window --most definitely not a stalker--. But Yandere-chan doesn't know who this mysterious man is, why he's standing there and if he might be interested in her as well. Should she approach him and confess her feelings to him? Or should she keep her feelings hidden to avoid a heart-break?</p>\n<p>A \u00b115.000 word story, rated PEGI13 as long as censor is kept on, rated M if you dare to turn it off.
