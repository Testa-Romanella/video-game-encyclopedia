It allows the players to simulate the performance of pop music by tapping, swiping and holding your fingers on the touch screen. And, this game is FREE!!<br/><br/>    Before you download this game: The game itself does NOT provide any original music. In order to play iGoBeat, please synchronize the music you have into your iPad from your iTune library, and you need at least one song, which is in the music list of the current version of iGoBeat, in your iPod library. If you don't  have any of these songs, please refer to the link in the game of iTunes Store for previewing or buying the music. If you already have some or all of the songs, please name these songs and their singers correctly based on our music list, then iGoBeat can automatically search the corresponding songs for you. Please make sure that the name of the songs as well as the singers are consistent with the official information from iTunes.<br/><br/>     The game includes tutorial, easy, normal and hard modes.
