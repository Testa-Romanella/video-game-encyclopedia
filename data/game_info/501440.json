It's a slow-paced, atmospheric, relaxing musical puzzle game. The player hears a melody and has to recreate that tune by pressing buttons, triggering the right notes in the right order, the whole being presented as drops falling onto a body of water. Controls: computer mouse. Headphones advised.<br/></p>\n<p>The Team:</p>\n<p>Art: JuBa777 - https://www.instagram.com/julie.baechtold.art/ - https://www.artstation.com/juba<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/20808f159ddbca561e642277eee097b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JuBa777"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
