By absorbing energy, all the iconic objects would grow bigger and become shiny and colourful. However, the bright world cracks into pieces as soon as the player has given all the power to this world. This represents the end of both the subjective world of bright colours and the objective world of power or life limitation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By using visual changes and sound effects, iCharger builds an immersive and convincing environment. The whole experience includes three stages divided by red cages. Following the sound and particle instructions, the player can explore the world and understand the connection with the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The exciting part of this project is to generate ideas and concepts alongside the process gradually. At the start, the aesthetic models helped me to imagine the world and design details.  In the progress, all the feedbacks from people around encouraged me to make proper adjustments. Together with my understanding and updated thoughts, iCharger becomes what it looks like now. It changes from getting energy from the world to giving life to the world. This project, the audience and I constitute an aesthetic loop and influence all of us.\u00a0</p>\n<p>iCharger has a better experience on Oculus Rift.</p>\n<p>This is a player expereincing iCharger with VR headset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ad/1ad3041e7a08030fc1328a8e2cfce56d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JichenCui"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
