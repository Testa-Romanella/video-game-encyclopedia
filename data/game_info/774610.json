Create a trail and try to get as much points as you can.</p><p>Build a trail of dominoes. Each piece you place cost you -1 on score. If the deploying car cannot go further you can switch to another car (if you have any). You push the first domino piece when the trail is ready. Activating buttons (by falling dominoes) gives you positive score. You have limited piece count but there are additional pieces to gather sometimes. Use branchers (with two domino pieces icon above) to add another car.
