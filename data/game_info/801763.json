Months earlier, the more powerful House Esterbrint had attacked her family's lands. Her brother, the last Lord Wycke, was slain, and she was forced to marry Lord Esterbrint and carry his child. That had gone badly, and now she lay on the cold floor of the great hall her brother had once ruled, dying of birthing fever.<br/></p>\n<p>Driven by a vision of her ancestor, she hauls herself forward and grasps the hilt of the Shadow Blade, an Artifact passed down within her house for generations. Supposedly possessing great power, its magic had lain dormant for as long as anyone could remember.</p>\n<p>The moment she touches it, there is a bright red flash. Magical energy surges through her, imbuing her with a strength she had never felt before. The guards scatter in fright as she gives the blade an experimental swing. Despite the fact she'd never carried a weapon before, it feels right in her hands.</p>\n<p>Now, with arcane powers\u00a0unleashed, Elisa will take her revenge.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95c/95cf4e762463f28fb023b7e8a5265ff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XCVG"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
