The creatures want you to complete a certain task before they allow you to go back. Nothing seems familiar to you in here. You are equipped with two easily inflammable balls attached to the torches. Then it hit you, the poi dance. You trained it some time ago. Right, that\u2019s my chance - you think. In control of the fire go and burn \u2018em all!</p>\n<p>Mechanics\u00a0The playable character follows the rotation of the player\u2019s mouse. You can throw and pull in your poi balls, each separately controlled by Left/Right mouse keys. When the balls collide they create a cloud of fire.</p>\n<p>Torches will burn out after a while. Unlit they won\u2019t provide enough damage to the enemies, meaning you are not able to defend yourself. Also, in the darkness enemies will gain more courage and attack you. Keep your fire alive, or die!</p>\n<p>Ai\u00a0Enemies hide in the darkness and once in a while charge at you. They are also able to unlit the surrounding torches.</p>\n<p>Music and sounds\u00a0Music is done with guitar and some editing applied. Enemies\u2019 voice is my voice with changed pitch. Despite that, original recording sounds almost the same! :D</p>\n<p>Graphics\u00a0There are a lot of particles and post processes. And some 2d sprites of course.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff0/ff0cb411dd05c86ba808ed5f85381d3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Risist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
