You wanted something interesting in your life to happen - ANYTHING AT ALL, so you went on some sketchy foreign website that claimed to offer \"real-life superpowers\" and you made the cheapest purchase. That probably explains why the rockets hurt.</p><p>One day you were randomly abducted from your house and thrown onto an operating table. A group of burly men hold you down as you squirm in confusion and you pass out from shock. But then you wake up in a strange empty room with orange clothes on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:41:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a4b7400ef9c55023bac286c750000c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SideCo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
