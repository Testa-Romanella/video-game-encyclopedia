Or after a trip? Or even coming back from the cinema? The feeling of taking your clothes off without any worries.</p>\n<p>Homebase is a top-down game where the player controls a spaceship hovering throughout the galaxy. Although you can go far, collecting resources to upgrade your ship and base,\u00a0 you always have to go back home to do so. It seeks to show players that home is not just your own private space, but also everything that surrounds it and your actions affect the whole, not just separate places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Global Game Jam Theme:</strong></p>\n<p>This year GGJ theme was \"What home means to you\", so we decided to capture the feeling of returning home and apply in to a game concept.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game works with the concept of how the feeling of\u00a0home feels like\u00a0and how your surroundings affects it. Your home is the place you feel most comfortable in and when you get away from it you can feel kind of nostalgic, longing to go back. To explore this concept within the game we used a camera system, designed to keep your home within view for as long as possible, and the music, which changes as you get closer or farther from your base.<br/></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Mouse - Aim and Shoot</p>\n<p>Keyboard - Movement</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Collaborators:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Designers:</p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9 Ruiz (https://andrerx.itch.io/)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leonardo Gonzalez (https://itch.io/profile/cookieeatingleo)</p>\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<p>Daniel Oliveira (https://dannyvegas.itch.io/)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Helena Martins (https://www.instagram.com/smashmallow_/)</p>\n<p>Sound Designer/Composer:</p>\n<p>Lucas Reis (https://lucas3311.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Michelle Santiago (https://itch.io/profile/misantiago17)</p>\n<p>Special thanks to every member of the RPG- Rio PUC Games team (https://rpgriopucgames.itch.io/), from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and also Campus studio and Instituto Genesis PUC-Rio for helping this game to happen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/22778422c48a667cb2335a0f9194b872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Lima", "DannyVegas", "misantiago17", "Andr\u00e9 Ruiz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
