Together they must keep the station running smoothly, whilst dealing with antagonistic forces who threaten to sabotage the mission.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each round, players select a crew member role on the station. These range from high up positions like the captain and heads of staff, to engineers, scientists, medical doctors, security officers, all the way down to the lower responsibility roles such as the janitor and lowly assistant. At round start, one or more players will be given an antagonistic role at random, and a secret objective that\u2019s very likely to cause disruption to the mission at hand.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWhen the crew aren\u2019t turning on each other through sheer paranoia, they will face various dangers depending on the round: Sleeper agents hell bent on sabotage, shape-shifting aliens, RPG toting syndicate operatives and more. Not to mention the occupational hazards of working in space, such as decompression, meteor showers, radiation storms, airlock mishaps, rogue AI and catastrophic engine failure.\r\n<br/>\r\nDynamic Atmospherics System \u2013  hull breaches can remove all the oxygen from a room!<br/>\r\nFully destructible station- Take it apart piece by piece, or build your own rooms!<br/>\r\nChemistry system \u2013 Mix chemicals to create medicines, or something explosive<br/>\r\nRandom Events \u2013 Dodge meteor showers, solar flares, radiation storms and more.<br/>\r\nInfinite Replayability \u2013 100% Player driven gameplay, no two rounds will play the same.<br/>\r\nFrequent updates, new features and bug fixes<br/>\r\nPowerful admin tools and active admin staff to deal with those ruining the fun<br/>\r\nIn-game Mentor system \u2013 Designed to answer any questions a newbie might have<br/>\r\nIt\u2019s Free!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-03T02:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f427b120bbe0a6f0ba06643f66b4aa37.jpg", "website": "https://spacestation13.com/", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 11, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exadv1"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
