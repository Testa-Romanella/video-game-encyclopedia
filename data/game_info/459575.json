Split yourself in half to complete every puzzle in this game.</p>\n\n<p>I forgot to say in game, but you use E to switch between which part of the body you're using and you can jump with the upper-body to move faster, but it doesn't jump that high<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please do not play in full-screen</strong> it breaks the scene transitions! Also when the door opens and nothing happens, that is the end<br/></p>\n\n<p>All assets, music, code, etc was made by NovaKnight531 (me) in 48 hours for the United Game Jam.
