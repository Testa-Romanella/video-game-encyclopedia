{"id": 151105, "slug": "waveformer", "name": "WaveFormer", "name_original": "WaveFormer", "description": "<p>WaveFormer uses the volume from your microphone to create the amplitude for a waveform. Use mouse clicks to indicate when the waveform should cross the axis, and your waveform will be drawn. Manipulate your wave to collect wave-points on the level. Part strategy, part execution, part silliness.</p>\n<p>Group and party play is recommended! What's better than yelling at your computer alone? Yelling into a microphone with friends! Have one person handle the mouse, while others contribute their voices to the magnitude of the wave! Good luck coordinating!</p>\n<p>For additional challenge, try speed-running the game. Runners will find that the wave draws much slower when it is both high amplitude and high frequency.
