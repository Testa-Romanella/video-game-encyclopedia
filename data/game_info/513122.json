You will need to get resources (wood/silver/gold) and buy items (Axe/Pickaxe) needed to get more. When you collect enough you will be able to build tower to protect your village, each\u00a0 tower can be improved. On map you can find treasure chests and yellow potion which will double your walking speed for one minute\u00a0(only one can work on time if you take new, it wont give extra speed or time). Axe , pickaxe and potions are also\u00a0 randomly spawned on map. Maximum you can hold 3 x each item if you pick up new it will repair what you have. Items get damaged during use and break.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game contains elements from the <strong>strategy </strong>,<strong> towers defense</strong> and <strong>survival</strong>.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move : W , S , A , D or Arrows</p>\n<p>Action : F , R or Mouse\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quest : Q</p>\n<p>Pause\u00a0 : Esc\u00a0</p>\r\nCheck latest update on YouTube Channel\u00a0TW Games Indie Dev\r\n\n<p>Web GL version :\u00a0P<strong>lay on full screen</strong> game is for standalone with resolution 1920 x 1080\u00a0, but to give more ppl access I add it,\u00a0 that you don't need download anything\u00a0if you don't want to.</p>\n<p>Game main focus is Standalone so hope everything will work like it should on WebGL, however some sound is quieter and slightly different (Mining , Pickup).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Village of Time - Prologue give access only to 1 level.
