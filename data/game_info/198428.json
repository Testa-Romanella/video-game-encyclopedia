It does take several tries to fully apprehend it and \"control the randomness\". Hope you'll enjoy it! <br/><br/>Made in ~30 hours with Construct 2. Music with Ableton Live. <br/>Also: Photoshop, Audacity and free sounds. </p><p>For Ludum Dare 36: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&amp;uid=66030</p><p>Twitter: @messire_Cookie<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06df4df5f65b777bf1725a0a90060414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David \"Cookie\" Fonteix"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
