You have to switch between holding the gun and holding the torch. If you hold the gun, you can shoot enemies but you will have a small field of view. If you hold the torch, you will have a large field of view but you cannot shoot enemies. \r\nThis game fits the theme because the torch joins the player with the ability to see\u00a0and the gun breaks \u00a0it. Good luck, gamers!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nA Word From The Author\r\n<p>The following game is made for the GMTK jam with the theme \"joined together\". This game is made in 2 days.
