In this early experiment, each chunk has a square platform at the center and generates bridges leading outward, each of which has a randomized offset. Because neighboring chunks use the same coordinates to seed the random number generator when creating bridges, bridges leading out of one chunk should always connect with bridges leading in from their neighboring chunks (the exception is the first bridge leading out of the spawn chunk, which is a template I placed for convenience and thus should be the only case of a bridge not leading anywhere).</p><p>Read more on my blog about my progress with this system and my other projects.<br/></p>\n<p>Chunks in this demo also spawn chests that can be collected and  \"zombies\" that follow and attack the player, although there is no health or score.<br/></p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/>Space to jump<br/>Escape to restart<br/>Left shift to move slowly, which may help on the narrow bridges.<br/>Ignore \"rotate view\" in the on-screen directions; the camera does not rotate.<br/>After clicking \"Play/Restart\", click somewhere else to prevent the level from regenerating if you press Space.</p><p>The background for this page was made with JSplacement, a free tool for creating tiling textures that resemble armor, circuitry, and other artificial surfaces.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29ec4160f43a0871b282fa553a55df82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
