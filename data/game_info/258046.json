There are portals which you must use to escape, but only some of them allow progress while others troll you or kill you with Spoops. Your only weapon is the ability to move objects like blocks and walls with the mouse, and your only ally is a guide. With these resources, you must escape the house while moving and not touching the blocks or walls, avoiding monsters (Zombies are fine) and finding the right portals. Prepared to get spooped!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae91221cb0016d46e123b09378c827e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Santiago"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
