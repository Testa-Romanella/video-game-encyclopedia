How low can you go ?</li><li>You have a limited air supply, so look out for those rare <strong>air capsules</strong>!</li><li>You can have multiple player accounts, but the <strong>hiscore table</strong> is shared. Challenge your friends to see who can top the scoreboard !</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use the crank</strong> to rotate the entire level.</li><li><strong>Dpad drills</strong> up/down/left or right.</li><li>Bricks of the same type stick together, you can <strong>drill whole groups of grouped bricks</strong> with one drill. Beware, though, this can cause so much damage that it will trigger a cave-in!</li><li>You cannot drill though <strong>black stone</strong>.</li><li><strong>Cross bricks</strong> are tough to drill through. You \u00a0will consume 10% of your air supply on each one.</li><li>Keep track of your remaining air with the<strong> air gauge</strong> on the right. It's virtually impossible to make it all the way down without picking up at least one air capsule.</li><li>Air capsules recover <strong>50%</strong> of your air supply.</li><li><strong>Falling bricks can kill you. </strong>Fortunately falling bricks will stick to any brick of a similar type, so if you're clever you can spot which bricks will stick before falling far enough to kill you.</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Always have a look around at the top of the level. </strong>You can rotate a full 360 degrees at the top, and choose where's best to start drilling.</li><li><strong>Bricks wobble before falling.</strong> Learn when to risk running below wobbling bricks and when to let them fall.</li><li><strong>You can see the back of the level through the spaces where you drill. </strong>This might help you spot air capsules which you might be able to reach if you drill sideways enough.</li><li><strong>There are a lot of cross bricks.</strong> Plan ahead so you never have to drill through them. Losing 10% of your air supply will easily get you killed before that next capsule comes along.</li><li><strong>Drilling straight down is the fastest way to progress. </strong>Sometimes you don't need any more strategy than just drill-drill-drill !</li><li><strong>You only have one life! </strong>If you think you might be drilling down into an area you can't easily escape from then take a second to plan ahead.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This demo is completely free.
