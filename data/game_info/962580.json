Picking from a wide variety of game pieces and combinations, there are countless possible setups offering refreshing and intriguing experiences. In addition, a game can be set up with <strong>Conditions</strong> that can vary how the game is played. From extending night rounds to boosting each player's starting coins, <strong>Conditions</strong> bring another twist into the fold.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Hotseat Multiplayer for up to 6 Players.<br/></li><li>Single player <strong>Scenario Mode</strong> with pre-selected balanced setups to gradually introduce mechanics and progressively challenge the player.<br/></li><li><strong>Free Play Mode</strong> with adjustable game setup options, playable with friends or varying AI difficulties.<br/></li><li>7 different buddies to play as, or play against, each with their own unique ability.<br/></li><li>Over 20 different types of food to grow your buddies in a myriad of different ways.<br/></li><li>6 different jobs for buddies to promote to, each having at least 4 unique skills to change up the game.<br/></li><li>6 neutral skills that anybuddy can use.</li></ul><h3>Promote and Play</h3>When your buddy promotes to a new job they gain powerful skills and a matching new look!
