{"id": 386811, "slug": "broken-song-the-sleeping-dagger", "name": "Broken Song The Sleeping Dagger", "name_original": "Broken Song The Sleeping Dagger", "description": "<p>'<strong>Broken Song The Sleeping Dagger</strong>' is an adult visual novel with fantasy elements. It is my way of paying hommage to various adventure games, works of literature, comics and artists which have inspired me and shaped me as a storyteller and as an artist.<br/>As of now it is in a very, very alpha version. It is also a very personal project, since it's my first foray into this mysterious and thrilling world of digital art and illustration (I started digitally drawing 2 months ago, but have been drawing my whole life).<br/>This coming of age story follows our young hero who, finding himself alone on this world after his late father tragically dies in a fire, falls into the protective custody of his father's friend from way back, Emily. Whether by coincidence, or by the hand of fate herself, our hero will soon find out that his late father's friend was really the only person he needed at this stage of his life. And before he knows it, he will embark on a journey he could never have dreamed of...</p>\n<p>If you liked it consider supporting me on patreon :)</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/brokensonggame<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/ccaa164379377e135d087b5a75cc17d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kiyankris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
