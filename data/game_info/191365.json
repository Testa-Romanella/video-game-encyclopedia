The archive contains a tape image for use with digital emulation, which can be transferred to run on real hardware with the correct PC and Apple Mac tools, though you will need some technical know-how to achieve this.\u00a0Alternatively, break in to the program, add a blank disk image to your emulator and save the program listing to disk.\u00a0There is no copy protection included here, unlike the Commodore 64 version. So this means you may also LIST the program to examine the source.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24cc8ddfb6432cba839591680ed41b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cronosoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
