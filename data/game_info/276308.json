This one adds some extra features to allow for more terrain options. This one has perlin noise terrain generation with multiple octave noise passes to add bumpiness. It also applies splat textures depending on the slope height at the x y coordinate in the terrain. Trees and rocks are generated. Grass is generated in patches. It now uses guide images to give a more styled look. Maybe in future iterations ill add the ability to load your own images.</p>\n<p>Controls are pretty simple.</p>\n<p>Simply control the menu to change the terrain.</p>\n<p>When in Play mode you control it like a standard fps game.</p>\n<p>You can hit esc to go back to the terrain window so that you dont actually need to quit out at any point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b02/b02d87ba463e745bdc91c39c5a6a3cae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BuffCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
