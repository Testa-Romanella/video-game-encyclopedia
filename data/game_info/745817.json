The graphic style is retro with a modern twist, with gameplay taking place in an old-school isometric world, while the story unfolds as an interactive comic book with all illustrations hand-drawn in pixel art!<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>THE STORY SO FAR:</h3>His only memory is being in a car chase involving his mother, after which, Adam finds himself alone in the middle of a dystopian city, not knowing how he got there. He soon discovers that a mysterious governmental organization is after him, but he has no idea why.<br/><br/><br/>During his struggle to evade the murky forces hunting him down, Adam meets an eccentric cleaning robot. Despite being called TURBO, Adam\u2019s new robot friend is clumsy and slow, albeit with a big (digital) heart. TURBO teams up with Adam in his mission to stay alive and uncover the dark truth surrounding the accident.<h3>IT'S A COMIC BOOK, TOO!:</h3>Get drawn into the game through its carefully illustrated pixel-art comic book. Your progress helps tell the story. Recover the missing pages to piece together the unsettling truth behind the accident and why you\u2019re being followed wherever you go by deadly robots. And the story has only just begun.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>STEALTH OR DIE:</h3>In the world of SUS, you have no power over your enemies. You\u2019re completely vulnerable! Without any combat capability, your only chance of surviving is through stealth. <br/><br/>Scan your surroundings and work out how to use them to your advantage. Make the most of each character\u2019s unique abilities to trick your enemies, sneak past them and stay undercover.<h3>SWITCH BETWEEN TWO UNIQUE CHARACTERS, AT ANY TIME!:</h3><strong>TURBO</strong>,is a rickety old cleaning robot, but it has some very handy skills! It can:<br/><br/><ul><li>hover above holes to propel itself to new areas; <br/></li><li> transform into a metallic ball and roll up pipes and down narrow alleys;<br/></li><li>generate a powerful electric shock by spinning in place, temporarily disabling nearby electronics;</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Adam</strong>, is a regular boy who is also uncommonly resourceful. He can: <br/><br/><ul><li>remotely take control of enemies, open doors and disable security systems; <br/></li><li> create diversions with everyday objects; <br/></li><li>make use of clever gadgets to solve the puzzles in minigames;<br/><br/></li><li> and more...</li></ul><h3>NO ORDINARY HEALTH SYSTEM:</h3><br/><br/>SUS replaces the old-school health bar with a <strong>threat level</strong>. It serves to immerse you even further into the story, bringing you closer to Adam, the ordinary boy whose life depends on outsmarting his enemies. Stay undetected to keep the threat level low, or get detected to make enemies follow you, only to trick them into letting you into restricted areas. The threat level goes back down when you hide. But you can\u2019t stay hidden forever!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-11T13:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd43dad46672de951b1cee8568e128c.jpg", "website": "https://inktopixels.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ink To Pixels", "InkToPixels"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ink To Pixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
