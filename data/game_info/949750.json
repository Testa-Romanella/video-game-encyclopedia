They quickly developed clockwork robots to make their lives easier, and soon enough their whole society was built on the foundation of this technology, even renaming their world to the Steamlands.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The Royal Scientist and his team of engineers had worked out an experiment that could potentially combine the efficiency of a mechanical robot with the ingenuity of a living, sentient being. They set about building a \u201cQueen\u201d for the robots, and went about seeking volunteers for testing this new mechanical being intended to be the center of a hivemind for all the robots in the land.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The experiment had catastrophic results, and all rabbits in the Steamlands ended up dead. As the last two robots in a land long dead, you have to escape this hellscape before you too become a lifeless rustbucket. To do that you must go through the now insane Queen. You have to communicate and work together\u2026 just like clockwork.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e9148f1051987b2b0011a9dfe579fc64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames", "ATSaleteg", "WhatTheMagic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
