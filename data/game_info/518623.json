Are you succumbing to cabin fever or could rumours of a mysterious lake creature actually explain her disappearance?<br/><br/>An avid social media user, you post regular photos and updates to your friends and followers.

Growing up in Finland meant I spent a lot of time swimming in lakes and hearing about the N\u00e4kki, a creature used to scare children away from dangerous waters. <br/>I also wanted my game to feel contemporary and more in line with how people behave and interact in 2020. For better or worse we use our phones for almost everything so I wanted that to be a key narrative device. <br/>Finally, in terms of gameplay and general atmosphere, I wanted to create an experience that was suspenseful, relaxing and slightly tongue in cheek.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9f4606569425757446d9a08b8c2e8f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["inkakamu"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["inkakamu"], "esrb_rating": null}
