I made the animations of the weapons used by the character in the game myself.</p>\n<p>This game was made for PC, but it has also been converted into WebGL format so that it can be played on the website. Therefore, there may be fps issues or poor graphics quality in WebGL format. If you want to play and experience the game fully, please download the Windows version!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, it will tell you that you lose the first time you enter the game, as it cannot read the date initially due to a problem with the WebGL format. This is a problem that occurs entirely in WebGL format, which is not present in the PC version. If you encounter such an error, please click restart level.</p><p>**Fix Notes</p><p>Decreased mouse sensitivity for the web version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T11:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ae/7ae8272f3990ba861cfe16fdc9fab2f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["clrflapple"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
