Learn the pattern of the movement and take your best shot! Try to complete all the stages!</p>\n<p>This is my first time using the HTLM Exporter, and for some reason the relative volume of my sound effects with the background music is coming out a little louder than intended, but otherwise everything else seems to be working from what I can tell. If you prefer you can download the executable instead.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out and hope you have fun playing Wait For It!</p>\n<p>I have thoroughly tested that each stage is definitely possible, although some are exact margins of accuracy. If you're having trouble on any stage just hit me up on here or twitter and i'll post the solutions if needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee527b980e945022aa7e775b1dce55c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Doublesquare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
