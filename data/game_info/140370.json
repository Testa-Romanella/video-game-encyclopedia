No need to press any button,\u00a0\u00a0just steer using the controller movement and touch the bombs.</p>\n<p>This prototype was done as part of Playmaker Game Jam, March 2018.\u00a0Requires a VIVE VR headset and controllers (works better with room-scale).</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions / feedback / comments - send me! hi(at)joyofvr.xyz or DM me in twitter @maorux.
