I am going to continue with this game very soon in collaboration with an artist. The story goes that you have died and the town misses you, and your ghost therefore has to go around the town helping out all the poor grieving townsfolk. Use A,D,W,S to move, X for action and mouse click to pick up objects (if next to them). It\u2019s a 1 minute play, but hopefully the idea will have enough legs to become a completed project (with fantastic art!)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a74/a742fad85bf876beee63f8fe7938c5e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dutchlish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
