Some of them might even trigger a panic attack and cause a game over if they get too close.</p>\n<p>In order to gain back sanity, you can take small rests at benches to gain a clear mind. These benches will also be next to a light source, which all animals can never get close with.</p>\n\n<p>Your overall goal is to collect 3 items from the forest\u00a0to fix your car and escape.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Artist: Dezura (Itch.io)<br/>\n</li><li>Composer: Hilo (Youtube)<br/>\n</li><li>Programmer: Eagullfly (LinkedIn)</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T08:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f78/f785f1aba3b33c74f40d0ede84a47781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Dezura"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
