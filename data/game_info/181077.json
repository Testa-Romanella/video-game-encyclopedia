Find it at the bottom of the page.\r\n\n<p><strong>Slide to survive</strong> is the most intense <strong>slide puzzle game</strong> ever created.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A fast-paced take on the old slide puzzle classic- with added peril.<br/></p>\n<p>With 6 different ways to die, it's up to you to save the tiny people from their impending doom\u00a0by solving the randomly selected puzzles.</p>\r\nCan you save the tiny people?\r\nAre you sharp enough?\r\n\r\nGameplay Footage\r\n\n\n<p>This game was inspired by my fond memories of\u00a0old slide puzzle games. I wanted to design a title with a\u00a0new take on the old classic using my knowledge of abstract graphics programming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The video below presents a behind-the-scenes look at the development of the title,\u00a0 featuring prototypes which eventually led to the inception of the final game <strong>Side to Survive!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a one man 'studio',\u00a0creating games from scratch with\u00a0<strong>entirely self-built technology</strong>. All programming, artwork, sound effects, and promotional material was created by me, the only part I didn't create was the music which is royalty free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have dedicated my life to acquiring the skills to create this title, and I am very proud to be releasing it into the world. The game took 6 months to develop, from conception to completion, and was completely self funded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first full title designed on top of my <strong>shiny new game engine</strong> which has taken me 5 years to develop.\u00a0In that time, I have sacrificed almost everything in order to create a life that allowed me to continue my quest for creating games from scratch.<br/></p>\n<p>I am so happy to be able to be finally releasing my work.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun.</p>\n<p>James</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34e/34e122843e966bee329a525e95920d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yesindiedee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
