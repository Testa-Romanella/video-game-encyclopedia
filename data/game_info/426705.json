Also this may be a bit of a heavy game, especially while everyone is in isolation, so I apologize. The game deals with privacy concerns, police corruption, and how the victims of violence, or any kind of tragedy, are actual people, more than just a series of facts. I don't know if I managed to tackle these themes well (possibly not) but I hope so.</p>\n\n<p>Content Warning:<br/>Violence, Hunting, Police Brutality, Language, Minor Flashing Lights</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca858199faf2b5e81eceef7e22b73dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thatguynm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
