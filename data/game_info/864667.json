Test your skill and reflexes in this pixel art action roguelite and see how many waves of enemy bats you can hold off.<br/></p>\n\r\nWhy does this game exist?\r\n<p>This game exists as a one-month project to build a game in\u00a0Godot (a game engine I've never used before) from scratch. Followed HeartBeast's tutorial about how to make an RPG in\u00a0Godot (Check him out!) and expanded upon his ideas and structure.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Altough this is a one-dev project, I must give credit to multiple people who contributed in the project:<br/></p>\n<p>1. HeartBeast: Credit for the base structure of the game, as detailed in their video. Credit for all the art extracted from them (main character, bats, brushes, trees, grass and bats!)<br/></p>\n<p>2. LetargicDev: Credit for portal asset<br/></p>\n<p>3. Lokif: Credit for a number of sound effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408ea11f4db04a59bee256b10bf896b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["adriaserrano97"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
