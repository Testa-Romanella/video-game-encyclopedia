Slash, clash, parry, dodge and watch limbs fly in the atmosphere of historical feudal Japan. Choose your move carefully - <strong>the first cut is also the last.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A refined and intuitive fighting system</strong> - Aim your sword to block attacks and strike around your opponent's guard. Parry their attacks with your own, dodge to close the distance, and interrupt them with a well-timed shove. It takes a minute to learn, and a lifetime to master.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Customize your fighter</strong> - An array of different options to wear. Choose and colour each piece separately to make each character your own.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dueling with deadly results</strong> - Send heads and limbs flying as blood rains down and stains the characters and environment. Chop your opponent to pieces, or equip a wooden sword instead for a little mercy and possibly a concussion.<br/><br/>Duel your friends in <strong>local multiplayer</strong>, fight custom <strong>AI opponents</strong>, try to stay alive in <strong>Survival mode</strong>, or hunt down enemies in the <strong>Scenario mode</strong> campaign. <br/>Play with friends remotely using <strong>Steam Remote Play Together.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Bonus modes</strong> - Laser swords, custom blood, floating weapons, zombies, and more.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T13:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/638399752edeaae66623b3bf020663a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Night Eyes Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Night Eyes Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
