Its my second game and my first solo-developed game. The theme was simple : \"Holes\". The \"story\" when you want to call it like that, is simple : fill holes = earn money ! It was fun and exciting experimenting with the different UI elements from the Unity engine as well as my first try at the save/load system. I hope you have fun trying the game out. If you find bugs or have ideas how i could improve my project feel free to write it in the comments.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Filling a hole is simple : click the button in the middle as fast as you can and buy upgrades for your machines that produce matter even if you are not clicking.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>When a hole is filled you move to a random location that has a random house and a random person.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The matter you need to fill a hole increases the more holes you have filled ( every 8 holes)</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The effectivity of the generators\u00a0increases at lvl. 20 and at lvl.50</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/02694fc1ea752fb6d4cf57e75151f6ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Henrik2k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
