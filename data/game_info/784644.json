Don't expect to do the same time again because the colours and the amount given are randomized meaning that the person will need to go around and change the different route they take with some being quicker while others are slower.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77ac3fa727eb73efb724c176ab06ac50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["318664"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
