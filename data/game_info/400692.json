{"id": 400692, "slug": "beatris-itch", "name": "Beatris (itch)", "name_original": "Beatris (itch)", "description": "<p>Beatris is your favourite puzzle block game set to music. Blocks fall to the tune and you have to make horizontal lines to get to the next level. If the blocks stack to the top it's game over.</p>\n<p>There are 6 dificulties at different speeds: Slow-mo, Getting There, Normal, That Herz, Hard Attaque and Chipmunk. Beatris also has a co-op multiplayer mode where you can try and beat all 10 levels with a friend or see how well you play with 2 games simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Be aware: this is not exactly like your favourite block game that will not be called Tetris for legal reasons. You can only drop your block all the way down, there is no wall kick or rotation delay and you can only rotate one way. Everything is made to follow the music.</p>\n<p>Note for Youtubers: This game is 100% content-safe. All music is either made by me, in the public domain and/or under a creative commons license. All songs are also properly accredited in the bottom left corner of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game for myself out of a couple of module projects I had lying about. It was a lot of fun to build and I hope you enjoy playing it. If you have any suggestions, want to share a let's play or want to tell me which game I should make into a music game next, please leave a comment down below.</p>\n<p>If you want to support me, please buy my other game: Detective Hank and the Golden Sneeze.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/057fcad4ffc4724e33e0245a149b79e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Obsessive Science Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
