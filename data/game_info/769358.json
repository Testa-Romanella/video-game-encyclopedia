How To play: entertain kids by preforming in a spring lock costume. click the microphones/banjos to entertain the kids. depending on which difficulty you pick that will be how much entertainment you have to give to the kids in order to win. but be careful, the entertainment will slowly go down over time and if it reaches zero its game over. if you click on the button that says \"spring locks\" a spring lock icon will be on your screen going to different places every 2 seconds. click on it to tighten the spring locks. if the spring locks reach zero it will be game over. if you get your entertainment meter over the goal then you don't need to preform anymore. but it is a safe idea to spend the rest of the time tightening the spring locks because they can go off even if you win. If your on easy you have to get 1000 entertainment, med 1500, and hard 2000. if you have any ideas for me to change in the game tell me in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T13:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea30f7e54d541831ff005654288569d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jamesfries"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
