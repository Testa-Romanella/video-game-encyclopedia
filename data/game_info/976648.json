See the world through the eyes of a lonely man talking a walk, try to escape from a secluded prison, or help a girl confess to her crush. While one on them is a kinetic visual novel, there won't be any choices to make, but the other two will have a big impact on the world the characters are in.<br/><br/>They Cannot Hear Me<br/>It's the middle on winter and a lonely man goes for a walk late at night. He spends the time thinking about how sad his life has become and how things will likely never change for the better for him. Will anything interesting happen on his walk or is he doomed to spend the rest of his life alone? As he walks around town he'll be reminded of events from his past. The man in the story doesn't have a name because it's not really important, so you can assume it to be whatever you want. Since this is a short kinetic visual novel there really isn't much else to say. There are no choices, it's just a really short story.<br/><br/>Trapped<br/>When you wake up in a prison cell, you have no memory of who you are or how you even got there. If you don't want to rot to death, it's up to you to find a way out and explore the island you've been trapped on with a girl you'll meet outside named Mila. Like you, she has no idea how she got to the island or what's going on. If you want to get out of there, both of you are going to have to work to together to escape! If you're not careful, your choices could lead to your death or you'll just have to die of old age alone. Whichever comes first.<br/><br/>The Weird One<br/>Camille has made up her mind and plans to confess her feelings to a friend of hers. However, what she doesn't know is that this guy is much weirder than she thinks. Whatever choices she makes will have a huge effect on whatever universe she's in. Some decisions may allow her to continue to have a normal life but others will throw her in all kinds of weird situations. Will Camille be able to tell Dave how he she feels about him or will he drag him into whatever weird things are going on with him?<br/><br/>All of these stories aren't very long which is way they've been bundled together in one collection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T03:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e09d28a11c17b901d4a23cd7e00b217a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Conor Hehr"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Conor Hehr"], "esrb_rating": null}
