{"id": 9499, "slug": "pressure", "name": "Pressure", "name_original": "Pressure", "description": "<p>The game is a classic example of arcade racing shoot-em-up with a top-down camera. It tries to mimic Japanese bullet-hell games with a more casual approach. The player takes control of the buggy and joins La Resistance to prevent the Count Soap crimes and the use of stolen water. The buggy can be customized to your taste, using more than 35 upgrades.</p>\n<p>Like the plot, the gameplay in Pressure is designed primarily for kids. This is indicated by the casual complexity, an abundance of bright colors and a specific sense of humor. Add here a variety of weapons, upgrades, and enemies; the output will be an excellent timekiller for a couple of evenings. The game features several levels of difficulty, achievements and the ability to go through a story campaign from more than 30 cards together with a friend using the capabilities of a split-screen local coop. All results are published online.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2013-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e743e4663ca848a2e3078e48760acb09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 53, "owned": 1537, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 19, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 85, "suggestions_count": 614, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 86, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chasing Carrots"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chasing Carrots"], "esrb_rating": null}
