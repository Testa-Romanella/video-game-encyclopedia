Instead of blasting away at enemies, however, you take the role of a field medic/surgeon who is tasked with saving lives over taking them. The patients that come to you are fresh off the battlefield and have a variety of injuries that you must treat. The sad truth is, you can't save everyone however and some are just too injured, thus you must perform triage on these patients in order to save yourself time and resources to save another. Good luck and don't panic<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T07:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c91/c9120701496d593c14510bb50b994f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jameslittlefoot"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
