This game is designed to be easy enough for anyone to complete, but challenging enough for even the most skilled players to enjoy.</p>\n<p>In Ten Second Time, your objective is simple: complete each level within ten seconds or less. However, if you fail to do so, don't worry! You'll be presented with a random upgrade that can help you in your next run. With good level design, unlocking things like dashing or double jumps can unlock entirely new - and faster - paths, giving you more options for completing each level.</p>\n<p>What makes Ten Second Time unique is that, unlike almost all other games, progression makes the game easier to complete. This normally means the game becomes too easy, and less fun. But in Ten Second Time, each upgrade you earn opens up new possibilities for completing levels faster and more efficiently. Better players will adapt to their random upgrades, find new paths, and be able to complete it faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>So whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, Ten Second Time has something to offer for everyone. Can you beat the clock and complete each level in ten seconds or less? The challenge awaits!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T16:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/1675161f991d5aec82f8b0bb410936e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunlii"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
