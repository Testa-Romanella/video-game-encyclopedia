You are playing as a cute monster who likes scoring balls into the holes. At first sight, it seems so easy to play but it\u2019s not true. Every level is unique and unrepeatable. You have to have a perfect strike power and be accurate. Again, don\u2019t think it isn\u2019t hard \u2013 you have to strike straight or kick a ball stronger. Besides, you have to think and use enemies and traps for successful game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour enemies are monsters who don\u2019t want balls being in the holes. For your information, monsters are slightly dull. They help you to do the level. All you have to do is to be wiser and use them in your own way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease, remember about finding a crystal and kick the ball using limited strikes. Can you do all levels? It\u2019s up to you. Good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T03:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab2b22daf30894b7418427ad22401cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dmitriy Uvarov", "NL Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NL Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
