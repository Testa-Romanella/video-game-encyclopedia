There are currently two toys in this toybox: <em>Chunky Orbits</em> &amp; <em>Rock Tumbler.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Chunky Orbits</strong> is a friendly simulation of free-floating objects based on Real Life physics. Each object in the scene attracts each of the others in a cosmic tug-of-war. Tap out a few boulders and contemplate the wonders of the Universe. (^_^)</p>\n<ul><li>Create and destroy colorful boulders</li><li>Add trail effects to visualize the paths they take</li><li>Add an absorb effect to grow bigger boulders</li><li>Create a sun-like CenterStone and create your own solar system!</li><li>Zoom in for a close-up with the <em>BoulderCam</em></li><li>Spacey, happy <em>music-to-ponder-by</em> included</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Rock Tumbler </strong>is a simple bit of eye-candy. It's a sphere full of colorful rocks and gems. The rocks tumble towards the screen with a swipe of your finger. A pleasing display of gravity at play.</p>\n<p>I'm offering this simulatiuon for free but you can also <em>Pay What You Want</em> to help support my game dev efforts.
