If that sounds familiar, you&#39;ve probably heard of Red Johnson&#39;s Chronicles or its sequel, One Against All. The largely unknown Metropolis Crimes actually came before both, but was distributed only in limited markets worldwide.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-30T20:17:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["DTP Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
