This game is going to be puzzle game inspired by the game portal. This game will not have a portal gun though its going to be a puzzle game like portal but not with robots and portals. Your goal of the game is to pass all the tests with outstanding results. When done you will be set free after all the tests. If you don't get outstanding results you will be stuck down in all the tests over and over again till you get great results. This will be in the game when its full version is out. Enjoy a bit of the beta for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2101a1d23c5cce848bd868b7ef8437de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameDevelopingForFun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
