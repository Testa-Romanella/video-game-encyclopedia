I tried to make a bootleg sequel to the original Metropolis movie from 1927, using backgrounds from the movie itself and expanding the lore. The game is set 100 years after the events of the movie and I've also implemented an alternative ending that was cut from the movie. Another source of inspiration was the game Snatcher by Hideo Kojima, I think a game like that with Metropolis' setting would be really cool.</p>\n<p>As usual the game was made in about 5 days for Bitsy Jam #69, so sorry for all the possible spelling mistakes and poor english, didn't have time to revise it properly (I probably will when I have some time)!</p>\n<p>Music by Wandering Artist (coming soon to bandcamp!)<br/>Backgrounds from Fritz Lang's Metropolis 1926 captured with Pixsy<br/>Font by miniwoolf<br/>Music added with Bitsymuse hack by David Mowatt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T14:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51e13fcc69f68fc61a9f5cbc57cc1b7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wandering Artist"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
