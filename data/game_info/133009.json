You get to watch Oppenheimer get the history changing orange! Except, where is the orange? It should be on the little wooden table to the left.</p><p>Because you are not really in the past, just viewing it, you can't really interact with anything. If you stare at an object, you can fuse with it, triggering an action. It might get someone's attention, or nudge a small object.<br/></p><p><strong>Oppenheimer</strong> will slowly make his way to the wooden table. The game ends when he reaches it. If the orange is on the table, you win; else you lose.<br/></p><p>Play Online in Chrome:\u00a0http://static.codeorshutup.com/adventureJam/public/index.html<br/></p><p><strong>VR Cardboard:\u00a0</strong>Use the online version.
