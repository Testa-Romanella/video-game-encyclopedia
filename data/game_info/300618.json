It's VERY short for now and has little to offer, but it's still worth a shot. You play as an unnamed protagonist (for now) who's goal is to get into a mansion (the reason for this goal is not fully thought out.). I worked REALLY hard on this game, so I hope you enjoy what it's got so far. Anyway, that's all for now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. Wouldn't it be cool if this got featured on one of\u00a0either Markiplier or Jacksepticeye's 3 Scary Games videos? Maybe we can get this near the top of the horror tag list?\u00a0Who knows?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T05:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c22b3962236ae968963c9bdeb07fac33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blooperss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
