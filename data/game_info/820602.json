Once you have enough money, you can choose to spend it on a re-roll, or a new die!</p>\n<p>There's two types of towers, a turret, and a missile launcher! Boom!</p>\n<ul><li>The turret fires single target projectiles at the nearest enemy die, and if it hits, the enemy die loses one pip of health. If the pip value was 1, the enemy die is defeated.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The missile launcher shoots explosive projectiles! Exciting! This tower aims at the nearest enemy and launches a projectile. The projectile explodes upon impact, dealing 2 pips of damage to the nearest enemy dice, and scattering the dice that survive. Be careful though, whatever those dice land on will be their new health!</li></ul>\n<p>Here's what you can spend your hard earned coins on:</p>\n<ul><li>To re-roll, click on the re-roll button on the top right.
