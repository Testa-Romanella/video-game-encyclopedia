As the dice numbers get higher, the enemies get tougher, and have special abilities!</p>\n<p>Earn coins by killing enemies, and use them to roll. Rolling grants you a buff, but also\u00a0a debuff! Buffs and debuffs have tiers, 1-3. The higher the tier, the better the buff, but also the worse the debuff!</p>\n<p>This game should work for most resolutions, however it has only been tested for 1920x1080 and 3440x1440.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing - Enkrypt</p>\n<p>17/07/2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f5722fd5f5a7c765585df8b96206936b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enkrypt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
