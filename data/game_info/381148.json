{"id": 381148, "slug": "group-4-game-collection", "name": "Group 4 Game Collection", "name_original": "Group 4 Game Collection", "description": "<p>A collection of student games made during the course of an eight week project. Each game was centered around a theme and made in a couple of days. The games vary significantly in gameplay and style.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Style beats:</strong></p>\n<p>Style beats is a 2 player versus rhythm game. Beat your opponent in rock paper scissors to get the spotlight, and style on them with a freestyle guitar solo! (In a draw, both players get the spotlight). Make sure to hit your notes in time with the beat and play unique combinations to inflict maximum damage to your opponents ego. Repeating previously played melodies reduces your damage, so stay creative. The first player to run out of ego (aka. health) loses! (Note! you can continue to switch your choice in rock paper scissors until the timer hits zero)</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Hit the left mouse button to start from the menu.</p>\n<p>Each player uses 3 buttons to play.</p>\n<p>Player 1: A S D</p>\n<p>Player 2: \u2190 \u2193 \u2192</p>\n<p>These buttons function as rock, paper and scissors, as well as various chords during the solo.</p>\n<p>Escape to quit<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Space &amp; watch:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Space &amp; Watch is designed like a Game and Watch game from the 80s, but plays like a modern bullet hell. The game will have you dodging asteroids with increasing speed while you try to survive and rack up your score. Increase your score by narrowly dodging asteroids and by staying closer to the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or the arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>Spacebar to clear the screen with a missle.</p>\n<p>Left click the on-screen \"Restart\" button to restart the game.</p>\n<p>Escape to quit.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Trust Factory:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In Trust factory you play a janky robot arm sorting boxes according to the whim of your AI overlord. Don't slack off, or the boxes will fill the room before you know it. If they exceed the limit, you lose. How many boxes can you sort before you are overwhelmed?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left click on a box to pick it up.</p>\n<p>Left click on a conveyor belt to drop a box you are holding on it.</p>\n<p>Left click the screen to restart after you have lost.</p>\n<p>Escape to quit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rhythmic labour:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a game about a boring job and a day at that job. You stamp letters and deliver packages full of letters to a vending machine. As the day progresses your character will become tired and slow, making it increasingly difficult to stamp and deliver letters. Make sure to look around the office for any tools that might help you chest your mundane task. How many letters filled boxes can you deliver before the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or the arrow keys to move around the office.</p>\n<p>Left or Right click to rotate your view around the office</p>\n<p>E to pick up stuff in the office.</p>\n<p>Spacebar to start working at your desk.</p>\n<p>While working at your desk left click to pickup a tool and left click again to use it.</p>\n<p>While working at your desk right click to let go of an item and reset it.</p>\n<p>While working at your desk press spacebar to stop working at your desk.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Why release these games?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted these games to be available for people to play somewhere for free. They are certainly not the best games out there, but I had fun working on them. My hope is that someone somewhere might find enjoyment in the work that we created.</p>\n<p>-The programmer</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming by Ludvig Baummann Olsson</p>\n<p>\thttps://twitter.com/LudBaO</p>\n<p>Art and music by Emil Kiviniemi</p>\n<p>\thttps://twitter.com/8bitMysli</p>\n<p>More Art by Alexander Linde</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:59:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d98f538e1c5fca495570a741268b6288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LBO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
