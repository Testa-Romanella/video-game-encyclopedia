The simple one finger control makes it easy for anybody to pick up and play, but it's also challenging without being frustrating. This game has three awesome game modes.<br/><br/>\u25caBit Bit Mode:  This is the main mode of the game.  There are three difficulties-Easy, Medium, and Insane.  Your ship loses a little bit of health every second and also when you collect the wrong color bit.  You must collect bits that match the color of your ship to add to your health and score.  Your ship randomly changes color and each ship has its own personal chiptune music theme.  There are also power-ups that randomly appear.  There is a Gamecenter leaderboard for each difficulty.  <br/><br/>\u25caObstacle Mode:  Your goal in this mode is to reach the finish line.  Each level has 3 stars that can be collected if you want to challenge yourself.  Watch out for the cosmic blocks, they do massive damage.<br/><br/>\u25caOne Bit Mode:  This mode is locked until you meet or surpass 50,000 points in Bit Bit Mode.  One Bit Mode has the same concept as Bit Bit Mode, except there's only one difficulty\u2026\u2026.Brutal.  Your ship changes color every time you get the correct color bit, but if you get the wrong color bit\u2026..it's gameover\u2026\u2026.until you press restart.<br/><br/><br/>3 awesome game modes!<br/>Neon!<br/>Fast gameplay!<br/>Simple controls!<br/>Sharp graphics! <br/>Retro!<br/>Challenging! <br/>Space!  <br/>Bits!
