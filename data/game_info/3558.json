You can create or join the clubs, the so-called communities up to 6 people, what makes the passage of common tests sufficiently easier (the actions of the club members affect the result). The environment and tracks are inspired by real locations in different parts of the planet. Also, there is an opportunity to generate dynamic weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, as well as day or night).</p>\n<p>There are three main in-game modes: tour, single event and multiplayer. In the tour, the player is given the opportunity to complete individual tests with a specific set of purposes and with particular test cars. In the check-in mode, one of three additional modes can be chosen: drift, race and time race.</p>\n<p>The game has a vast diversity of cars (in total 50 models), the auto park updates each time with the appearance of patches.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2014-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T20:29:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1de/1deed95a21d854f8a5cdfc249ff54c6c.jpg", "website": "https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/driveclub-ps4/", "rating": 3.51, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 1664, "beaten": 117, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 236, "playing": 25}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 126, "ratings_count": 443, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 445, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Evolution Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
