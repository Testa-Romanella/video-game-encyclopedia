This means that the game is quite short; I would have loved to been able to add more. Alas, it was not to be. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>[Context]</p>\n<p>Your a victim of an experiment held captive in a lab and you goal is to escape. The experimentation  caused you to have the ability to rewind time but when you do so, the obstacles you must face get more challenging.</p>\n<p>[Bugs]</p>\n<p>Sometimes the buttons in the menus don't work. At the bottom of the credits there is a restart button - this will restart the game but break the rewind mechanic.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52f/52f3f0bcb8323905fcd97905568a6939.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tomazgda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
