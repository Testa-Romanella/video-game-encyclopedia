It dates back to early 2020, but I never publicly made it available until now.</p>\n<p>This is a slightly improved version of what I submitted back in the day. While the puzzles did not change, I fixed minor bugs.</p>\n<p>I do not consider this little game completed yet, and I still have some designs for a couple new puzzles and rework for the ones already implemented. I am now more proficient than when I first made this project and hopefully in the future I will have time to give this game a well deserved overhaul!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:50:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb52f7a503e64d20a47a25a304740de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grusso94"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
