Constructing the Pyramid requires both workers and stone, both of which are resources to be mined! This is done by tapping on the Pyramid itself. A lot.</p><p>Click on the village and quarry repeatedly to gain workers and building material. <em>(You will also earn you these resources passively, at a slower rate)</em>. Both the village and quarry can be upgraded to increase total capacity and passive creation. </p><p>You can also set your work ethics!  These influence how hard you push your workers, but can be devastating toward your workers' happiness. You don't want that to reach zero, trust us. </p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p>Mouse: tap on buildings to upgrade/gather resources</p><p>A &amp; D or Arrow Keys: Move across map</p><p>1, 2, 3: Change worker ethics</p><p>Esc: Quit the game</p><p><strong>TEAM</strong></p><p>Producer: James Booth</p><p>Programming: David Harrison</p><p>Music: Liz Rainsberry</p><p>Graphics: Matt Frith</p><p>Made for the #GodJamIt game jam, hosted by Sean Oxspring<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8dd4f76963a491f2a5afa55b53eba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelSpill"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
