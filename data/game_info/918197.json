With help, <em>Bug</em> learns to deal with the hardships of the external world in a healthy way, and to integrate themself into society without being forced to be uncomfortable in their own skin, reaching self-acceptance.</p><p>Developed by:</p><p>@tgnics<br/>@crisiscore<br/>@leonardo_drt<br/>Francisco Pinto<br/>Daniel Salvador<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T08:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed47d2c8bf36f0bd0346facc64aa187a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tgnics"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
