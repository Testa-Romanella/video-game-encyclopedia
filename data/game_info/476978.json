Subject to change. <br/>It has around 3-4 hours of playable content, but is paced like a traditional longform JRPG with loads of secrets to find.</p>\n<p>Please share feedback and enjoy!</p>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Still not convinced?<br/>Check out this Let's Play!<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T05:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0b4a6bedddc74439c9e761503b1441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StayAwakeGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
