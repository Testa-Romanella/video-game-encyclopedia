The military is trying to stop the mutant outbreak while the mutants are attracted by electricity and increase in numbers each time one of them dies. You, as the sole survivor of a high-tech research facility dug into the mountains, have to figure out how to stop the mutant threat. Capture them alive and experiment on them to find a cure. Push the military back and stop them from interrupting your power-supply while mutants are attempting to raid your facility. Put up defenses to fight-off the ever increasing attack waves of mutants. Craft tools like motion-trackers, turrets, landmines &amp; weapons. Experiment on mutants and find the toxin. Capture areas in the game to weaken the factions and manage your facility.<br/><br/>The <strong>factions in the game fight each other on the map</strong>. It is up to you how <strong>you influence this fight</strong> - taking out military troops and cleaning up areas will strategically weaken them as they are loosing ground &amp; numbers. Mutants are a bit harder to stop as you first have to figure out how to push them back which also requires capturing one of them alive, they also evolve over time and you will see more variations of them.<strong>COOP SURVIVAL</strong>The game allows you to play coop with friends, hosting your own servers you can control who joins your game. Time is essential as the longer you play the larger the outbreak will become as it spawns out three classes of Mutants, each one larger and more deadlier than the last.<strong>Core Features</strong><ul><li> Single-Player and Faction-based Co-op Survival.

You must survive in this war but you can also influence the outcome as each faction spreads over the map.  The military will order air strikes against the mutants and try to hold key locations such as the town and their own military base, they will call in air supplies that can be intercepted.  The mutants will also try and take over the map and will eventually try to over run your base if they are not stopped. You have your own agenda of survival and both the mutants and military will kill you on sight.  The game will try to stop you any way it can and no two games will be the same thanks to the story telling mechanics that bring the two factions to war.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/266a1ee45a488dbc6ddf51b76ffd40ac.jpg", "website": "http://www.indiedb.com/games/outbreak-pandemic-evolution", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 71, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Forthright Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forthright Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
