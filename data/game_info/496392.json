It is surrounded by a dark story based in Gnostic creation beliefs. The game play is split between space and ground levels. The overall path is semi linear where the game will follow a main story arch and have multiple side quests. Fly around the galaxy finding both old artifacts and new technology to fight Yaldabaoth and his Ateratra. Upgrade your spaceship or buy new ones, upgrade items you find along the way, and keep a lookout for permanent health and attack upgrades in secret areas.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Aza <br/>A nomad wandering the galaxy with her pilot in search of anything they can sell to keep fuel in the tank.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <br/></strong></p><p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Yaldabaoth and The Ateratra\u00a0 </strong><br/></p><p>Since the splitting of Pleroma, the Aeons have been at odds.
