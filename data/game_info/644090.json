{"id": 644090, "slug": "marked", "name": "Marked", "name_original": "Marked", "description": "<p>A thriller/horror RPG that just uses a single deck of playing cards. A game about a group, marked for death, on the run from a subjugating dark force.<br/></p>\n<p>The Dark Ones have won. There are no more heroes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The world has fallen into subjugation. Even though it has only been a few years and life may not have changed drastically for some, all labor now serves the Dark Ones.\r\n</p>\n<p>Crime as we know it is seldom policed, for acts that darken a person also produce fruit for the new masters. When someone has stained their being with one or more atrocities, a Mark later appears on their face, without warning. This is a mark of sacrifice, denoting someone whose darkness is ripe for harvesting. Everyone knows this, and many are willing to submit to the Dark Ones' acolytes and leave this miserable world.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is not a story about those many. This is a story about the few defiant ones that found themselves marked and held on to hope. Although just rumors, they have a lead to how they can escape their grim judgment.\r\n</p>\n<p>But the Dark Ones are possessive of their slaves and after sensing the characters' spark of defiance, they have sent Reapers to hunt and reclaim their sacrifices.\r\n</p>\n<p>Will the Marked be able to evade the Reapers and find means to escape their fate? One thing is for certain, they will need each other to survive.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T06:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d674664ed01212a48f8f0f1fb25499dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["MevTheDreamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
