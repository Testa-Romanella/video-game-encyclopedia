You can use the arrow keys, but it is very awkward.</p>\n<p>Please don't be mean about that. I bet most of you play Minecraft. The controls are -- well hard to master. Yet most people love it. Same thing here on my game.</p>\n<p>===Instructions===</p>\n<p>If you hit the cacti with your sword, you can get a coin. The coins are used to buy extra hearts in the shop. You start with 5 hearts. You can't get any higher than that. But don't worry! If you try and buy hearts when you are at full, you will not lose coins.</p>\n<p>Kill the enemies with your sword.</p>\n<p>Try and beat the boss!</p>\n<p>Settings lets you change your hand orientation, which will let you swing faster on 1 side!</p>\n<p>Stats have all the cloud stats about the game! (Bosses beat, enemies killed, etc.)</p>\n<p>Read the signs! They have the storyline! Stand by them to read them!</p>\n<p>=Credits=</p>\n<p>Thanks to all the people who gave feedback on the thumbnail!</p>\n<p>Thanks to my mom, dad, and sister for basically the whole idea!</p>\n<p>Thanks to cooltext.com for the thumbnail text and the home screen text.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my in-real-life friends (NinjaBunny898012 (on Scratch), GarrRocks1564(on Scratch)) for testing! -UltraProgrammer-\u00a0helped test.
