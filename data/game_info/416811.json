Well-designed city will greatly improve economic efficiency which may convert into city income.<br />\nDiplomacy and politics:<br />\nThe governor will face very difficult choices to be made in a constantly changing political environment. Costly expeditions, Pharaoh and other cities requests, military threat and a mixture of different cultures will be a commonplace. A series of wrong choices can cost the loss of trading partners and low interest in the city by settlers. Moreover, the total lack of obedience to the rulers may end up with a civil war.<br />\nReligion:<br />\nDeity will be able to interfere with daily life but it will be done implicitly. The main aspect of religion will be satisfying the need for access to the places of worship, providing supplies for temples or organizing festivals. Neglecting this sphere may result in a dangerous social unrest on a par with e.g. famine.<br />\nTrade:<br />\nTrade is the most important element in royal treasury. Without it, it is very difficult for economic stability built solely on taxes.
