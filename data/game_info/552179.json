But, the wizard's magic can only keep you alive for so long. So, he wants you to explore a dungeon to find the Ruby of Life. He tells you that if you have that, you can live forever. The wizards magic can only do so much, and only keep you alive long enough to get the ruby. Meaning if you die, part of your life is withered away. The wizard uses his power to give you a boost. Therefore less life, more power.</p>\n<p>I made this project in 1 week with Scratch for the Blackthornprod Game Jam #3.
