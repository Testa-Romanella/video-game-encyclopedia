This is a room scale VR experience where you will have to defend yourself against endless waves of enemy robots. There are 8 different levels, each with it's own unique enemies. In each level you will have to defend yourself using either an assault rifle, turret or grenades, depending on what's available.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you will need to physically go to the ammo box and collect a magazine to reload. You will also have to use any cover, if available and use the radar attached to your weapon, to locate incoming enemies. Some levels, such as the 'Warehouse', will require a lot energy in order to get a high score. The turret has a heat display that shows you how hot it is. When it gets too hot then you will be forced to switch to using the assault rifle, while you wait for the turret to cool down enough to use again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you first start the game, please go to 'Training', where you will learn how to use the weapons and complete various timed challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level has a global and local leaderboard shown below it in the menu scene, so you can compete with other players to get the highest score. You can view these leaderboards by navigating to the 'Community Hub', then clicking on 'View Stats' and 'Global Leaderboards'.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582e1a22a547e2e2dcd0cea15734c2b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 98}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MobileFusion Apps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["MobileFusion Apps"], "esrb_rating": null}
