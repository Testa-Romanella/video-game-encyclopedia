It was originally created as a test of some code but was reused for the #7DRL game jam. All new art was created along with new audio. Most of the internal code was gutted except for some basic movement.</p>\n<p>The new art can be found here, made by Pete (@scutanddestroy)</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<ul>\n<li>Developer: @firebelly</li>\n<li>Art: @scutanddestroy</li>\n<li>Audio: @spellbang</li>\n</ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThe UI\r\n\n<p>The screen is broken up into 2 major areas. The HUD at the top and the controls at the bottom.</p>\n\r\nHUD\r\n<p>The HUD has the location on the left and your current goal on the right. You health and building materials are on the screen as well. <strong>SCRAP </strong>is used to build <strong>DRONES</strong>. You can find more scrap by killing creatures and robots.</p>\n\n\r\nCommands\r\n<p>The Controls allow you to interact with the world.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Movement is controlled by touching the screen in the direction you want to go.</p>\n<p>The DV system allows for the construction of utilities.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Dv.1 is a Flying drone that will pepper all enemies in a small area with light dmg. It is not very strong.</li><li>Dv.2 is a heavy tank drone that fires strong weapons alone the XY axis only.</li><li>Dv.3 is a non-combat barrier</li></ul>\n<p>Using the look command will give you information about where you are standing and if anything interesting is near you.</p>\n<p>Combat is simple. Using the 1 and 2 buttons will set up for an attack. Hit the button, then a DIRECTION you want to attack in. 1 is a melee strike near you. 2 is a long range single line attack.</p>\n\r\nData Terminal\r\n<p>Some objects can be touched to interact with. This computer terminal will let you know it can be used, but some objects don't. Look for something unusual.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nStasis Block\r\n<p>There are some creatures which are locked in a stasis field. At the moment you can either destroy them or find a way to free them.<br/></p>\n\r\nVersions\r\n<strong>V1.2 (3/11/18)</strong>\n<ul><li>Fixed broken event counter</li>\n<li>Added new audio</li><li>Deletes saved games on start (will change this eventually)</li></ul>\n<strong>V1.1 (3/11/18)</strong>\n<ul><li>Fixed broken computer terminal</li></ul>\n<strong>V1.0 (3/11/18)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>All new art</li>\n<li>New sound</li>\n<li>All new enemies</li>\n<li>New AI</li>\n<li>New cave generation</li>\n<li>New ship</li>\n<li>New events</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>V0.9 (3/5/17)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Old tileset</li><li>No goals</li><li>Basic combat</li>\n<li>Basic endless caves</li>\n<li>Basic Inventory</li></ul>\r\nTodo/Defects\r\n<ul><li>Save Feature is broken</li><li>Performance issues with final event</li><li>Tyops</li><li>Add better AI</li><li>You can lock yourself in with barriers</li><li>AI can be dumb</li><li>Add inventory and bonus</li><li>Add a level up system</li><li>Add random loot</li><li>Add new maps, open world? ships?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14efd5532e92049ac96b96d3030849f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Firebelly Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
