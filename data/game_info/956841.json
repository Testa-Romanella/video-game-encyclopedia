It's simply a remake of the famous Space Invaders, with some upgrades (bonus, moves, display, sprites...).</p>\n<p>It was made without any editor (it was hard :o), just with the pyxel module by Kitao, if you want the code, it is in the downable content. At the beginning, it was just a NSI project for school, so thanks to my teacher and my class.</p>\n<p>You can play it only on computer, but you can choose if you want to download the file, or just play the game on your browser.</p>\n<p>And finally, I'm still a beginner, so if you find any bug or any upgrade's suggestion, please tell them to me in the comments :)</p>\n<p>Thank a lot and have fun :o<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T16:34:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd47a5f718e0ea8a31da52928441f08e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ulysse"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
