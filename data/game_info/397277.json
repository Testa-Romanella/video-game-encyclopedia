Many thanks to\u00a0holy-fishstick-fight from tumblr for doing an emotional and perfect end-card. The other two remain in need of them, if you wish to do one, just contact me at Twitter!</p>\n<p>This fanroute is a passion project. Tavros is among my favorite characters in Homestuck, and I wanted to give a go at doing him justice in a Pesterquest format. This project started as a personal thing. I wanted to use my experience as an abuse victim, who also perpetuated abuse herself, to try and do Tavros and Vriska's dynamic justice. That would be only what it would be, except Tavros' official route came out, which I was waiting for to get the assets to use in my route. I realized that a bit of the fandom who wanted to see interactions with Gamzee and Tavros were let down, and thought I would try to fill that niche.</p>\n<p>This route is playable without interactions with Vriska- which I know can be upsetting for some people. Simply choose to comfort Tavros, and then direct him towards Gamzee. If you acknowledge Vriska at the first branch, it leads to a bad end where Vriska learned nothing. I normally do not share spoilers but due to her abuse of Tavros, it is worth sharing for full disclosure.</p>\n<p>This project will never be a paid download, and I only take credit for the content I\u00a0wrote as well as the code I put into this.</p>\n<p>Thank you for giving my project a chance, and thank you to all of you lovely folks who supported me through the production- you checking up on me and the occasional butt-kicking made sure I saw it through to the end. I appreciate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a81/a81b03a77119a50306108fc3b4292346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tavr1spr1te"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
