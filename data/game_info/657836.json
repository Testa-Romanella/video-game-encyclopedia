{"id": 657836, "slug": "spin-chaos", "name": "Spin Chaos?", "name_original": "Spin Chaos?", "description": "<p>Hi! This is a game I decided to work on. It has a 80s feel, and the goal of the game is to penetrate through \"temple\", steal all of the rubies, avoid the guards, and leave! I figured it was chaotic due to how the combat system requires the player to orient itself, and how the controls aren't exactly the most balanced. The game requires intuitiveness based on the controls.</p>\n<p>NOTE: I am a 13 year old developer, just entering High School with just a few months of Unity experience under my belt. I understand that the game will most definitely have bugs. But any constructive criticism is gladly accepted :)</p>\n<p>Controls: Pressing A will result in the player to move left, and downwards. Pressing D will result in the characters moving right, and upwards. Press the Spacebar to Shoot a sword!</p>\n<p>In order to beat the game, you must collect a minimum of 7 rubies and 30 coins before reaching the final stage. Avoid hitting the spikes, and the guards wearing red. It will result in an instantaneous death.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>**I attempted to make the game as hard as possible! If you do end up beating the game in a quick amount of time, please do leave a comment on parts of the game that felt too easy or too hard, and I will attempt to balance it out.**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/4832fd73e871b20152e5eb266c069d5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yhemmery"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
