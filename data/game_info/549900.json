You may only drop one charge at a time, so time the detonation to hit enemies with the explosion.</p>\n<p>Deeper submarines are worth more points, and any remaining time will award a\u00a0points bonus. When it gets dark you can use the sonar to detect enemies.</p>\n<p>Crates that fall from the sky will grant a random powerup. Planes that fly overhead may drop mines, so be careful!</p>\n<p><strong>## Controls</strong></p>\n<p>- `\u2190` and `\u2192` to move the submarine.<br/>- `SPACE` to drop a depth charge.<br/>- `SPACE` to detonate a dropped charge.<br/>- `S` to emit a sonar pulse.<br/>- `ESC` to quit.</p>\n<p><strong>## Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Arcade font by Yuji Adachi (http://www.9031.com/p-font/)</p>\n<p>Music by James Newton (http://www.prosody.co.uk)</p><p><strong>Homepage</strong>: https://www.sodaware.net/sb2k<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T03:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb9199fff58f9d4b0248b1e442d3e02d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sodaware"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
