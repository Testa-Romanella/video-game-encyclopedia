Sensei found me under the rock when I was just a\u00a0 little tadpole. He taught me everything I know, from making my bed to hunting for food, from swimming to hanging on a cliff. He also tought me to enjoy the process of whatever I do.</em></p>\n<p><em>But now it's my time to leave. But before leaving, I shall pass the ultimate test: sparring with my master. Yeah, the choice of the ultimate test is a bit underwhelming, but traditions are paramount. Especially for frogs! So, bring it on, Sensei, I'm ready to fight!</em></p>\n<p>You play as a frog in a traditional frog fight. The fight consists of several rounds, 10 hits each. Every round you either attack or defend, you can't attack during a defense round or vice versa.</p>\n<p>As a younger frog, you attack first. After 10 hits you change to defense, then back to offence, etc. The fight lasts until one of the frogs hits the water. Your frog's intuition will help you decide which direction to block.</p>\n<p>Attack and block with 'W/S' or 'up/down'. You can also use a controller, but I didn't test it.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Yngvarr - programming, little music jingles.</li><li>Syudzius - every single piece of visual art in the game.</li><li>I'll provide the list of used assets later.</li></ul>\n<p>We were so close to making a proper tutorial and several fights, where did all the time go?
