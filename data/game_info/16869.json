Structurally, the game is divided into 40 levels, each based on a fantasy area such as Bright Cave, Mote Grove and so on. Each level consists of nine hands. After completing the level, the player gets some amount of cash based on how well their performance was. The cash can be spent to acquire upgrades such as the ability to see the value of flipped cards or extra undo button. <br />\nThe player has to clean the board of cards chaining them one number higher or lower than the last one. If there are no cards left to the chain, the player can draw another one from the deck. The game has several features that differentiate it from other solitaire games besides already mentioned power-ups system. Chaining several cards without drawing additional from the deck makes a combo that increases the amount of cash that player gets after the level. Each the player progresses, several special types of cards appear, like frozen cards, which can be played only after activating a special fireball card. During the game, the player can obtain recourses that are used to grow different mystical pets. <br />\nBesides the default Adventure mode, there are also challenge mode, that lets you play levels with harder objectives, and quickplay, that lets you play any hand you\u2019ve already beaten.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T16:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952e5f4b30effbde2c8f605c3add59c9.jpg", "website": "http://www.subsoap.com/", "rating": 2.99, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 1110, "beaten": 39, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 26, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 88, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 88, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Subsoap"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Subsoap"], "esrb_rating": null}
