Game was made with my friend Naotami, who made all artwork and sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>Goal is to create as much satellites as required to build signal power. Each satellite adds a bit of signal power to the signal bar level at the top left corner. When signal power is high enough you recieving message from outter space and win the game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>To prevent problems with resolution and scale, please use fullscreen mode at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Before start you need to clear orbit from spacejunk, to perform this task, just click on each piece of spacejunk three times.</p>\n<p>To build satellite, you need to click spaceport button at the centre and drag your mous e in a direction, in which you want your satellite to fly. Each satellite cost 5M, which you gain by time and destroying spacejunk.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game, thanks to all who would play! Would love to see feedback and constructive criticism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>GL HF, stay safe, ADC_heh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:36:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a3a0653a4f9eab5f2485f6100398430.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krimso"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
