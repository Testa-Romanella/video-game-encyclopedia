Sparkling Blockade is a mashup of some iconic arcade games of the 80's like Breakout, Space Invaders and Centipede.</p>\n<p>The goal is to clear out the aliens marching from the top of the screen whilst making sure that none of them land on the surface of the planet. To do so, the ship has a plasma orb which bounces off and destroys stone blocks and petrifies aliens and a laser which also petrifies aliens. Be sure to not let the orb slip onto the planet as the ship has a limited supply unlike the laser.</p>\n<p>The aliens advance by moving horizontally left and right, turning direction and moving down when they\u00a0bump into a block or the side.\u00a0As the number of aliens diminish the remaining alien(s) speed up.</p>\n<p>There are also fleas which fall from the screen; don't worry, they are incapable of destroying the ship but they do place some blocks and, they paint and\u00a0repair destroyed blocks!</p>\n<p>As each wave of aliens is cleared a new wave advances, changing the colours and increasing the difficulty by increasing the amount of aliens, spawning more fleas, speeding up the aliens and increasing the velocity of the ball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/7109d21bc5adaeb376bbbab77445fc3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JobbyJames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
