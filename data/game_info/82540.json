And because they were jealous, the other clowns would torment Laugh Clown by throwing balloons at him until he cried. But one day, when those mischievous clowns were throwing balloons at Laugh Clown, something special happened: he moved out of the way. Then Laugh Clown laughed that charming laugh that the other clown\u2019s were so envious of.
