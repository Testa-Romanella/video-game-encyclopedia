Help <strong>Uni</strong> and <strong>Duni</strong> get back to their village by making several friends along the way!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our heroes will show that creativity overcomes violence and that it is possible to solve challenges in a <strong>fun and entertaining way</strong>! \u2665<br/><br/><br/><br/>UniDuni was designed to be a <strong>cooperative</strong> experience between two players. Walking and jumping mechanics are accessible, and collaboration is the big key to <strong>overcome</strong> obstacles. There is no single player mode, but nothing prevents you double the challenge while simultaneously controlling both characters!<br/><br/><br/><br/>We are trying to recreate with great care the experience we had growing up while playing platform games. We hope you can share that feeling with someone you hold dear and that <br/>can further strengthen the bond that unites you, be it a friend, partner, child or even a stranger!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some villains will try to hinder your journey, but we know that that won't be enough to stop our young heroes, will it?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank you so much for making it this far! Please consider adding UniDuni to your Steam <strong>wish list</strong>, this helps a lot to give visibility to the game.<br/>Cheers and be safe!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T02:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46fd40da0fc0ffcce2082cd0dc6dd590.jpg", "website": "https://unidunigame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clops Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clops Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
