Right click to rotate</p>\n<p>It's like tetris and a match 3 game. Get a line of 6 tiles in a row or 3 shapes of the same colour touching and they will pop.</p>\n<p>Try to build your way to the white X's on the grid. You need to reach all 6 X's with one continuous blob of blocks.</p><p>Made for Mini Jam 100:Overload. Theme was Overload. Restriction was Chaos is Everything. Overload was the grid expanding when you went over the edge. For chaos, I figured neatly making line and matches is the opposite of chaos so what if I make you want to not get lines and matches? Truth be told, the more chaotic features are still on the drawing board.</p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/GridOverload</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:03:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be42e5a244795ad91da89313acebcb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Solrun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
