The robots are piloted by Very Cool AIs that trained very good. They\u2019ll deliver all kinds of things, apples, couches, they\u2019ll even bring you joy if you give us enough money!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Play as a remote-controlled robot that delivers packages in a world with many floors. A speech bubble will appear on top of a building showing an item that it needs, and you will have to go to the building that creates that item. A clock will be on the top-middle of the screen. Each time an item is delivered, the clock will go up. When the clock reaches zero, your robot will be decommissioned, and you will be assigned a new robot that will have different stats compared to your past robot/s and a new place to deliver at.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Up/Jump - W, Up arrow, Numpad up arrow</p>\n<p>Down - S, Down arrow, Numpad down arrow, Numpad 5</p>\n<p>Left - A, Left arrow, Numpad left arrow</p>\n<p>Right -\u00a0 D, Right arrow, Numpad right arrow</p>\n<p>Select/Pickup - J, X</p>\n<p>Deliver - K, Z</p>\n\n<p><em>This game was made for the Black and White Jam #0.(9)!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be26326402eeb0e858b3ef813057c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SteekStook"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
