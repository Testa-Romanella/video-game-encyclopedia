You use two buttons (LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys, or the shoulder buttons if you're on a gamepad)</p><p>to control where you want to shoot the problem is you always move in the OPPOSITE direction due to the recoil.</p><p>It's a fun and addicting game and the average play time per life is about 20 seconds. But most people play for far longer than one life.</p><p>Music by Andreas Larsson</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/knugn<br/></p><p>Rest by Andreas Lidell (Hey that's me!)<br/>http://twitter.com/AndreasLidell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f0b062e6f9a9c27c1ed445472deda8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Andreas Lidell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
