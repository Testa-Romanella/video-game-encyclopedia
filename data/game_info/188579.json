You die if it runs into you.\u00a0 If you are standing somewhere that it has not been, it will be there.</p>\n<p>The best way to beat it is to stand somewhere that it has already been and hope it does not find you till you make it to the exit or it finishes it's run.</p>\n<p>It's not searching for you, it is just mapping everywhere there is a place for it to go. It uses the 'breadcrumb' analogy to remember the paths that it took. It uses 3 stack implementations. Position X, Position Y, Direction. It loads where it has been onto the stacks, and when it runs into a dead end, it backtracks by popping its history off the stack.</p>\n<p>Still in alpha. It's playable though. It's just a tester.<br/></p>\n<p>A vid of the bot doing a couple of full maze runs.</p>\n\n<p>Use the mouse wheel to zoom the view.
