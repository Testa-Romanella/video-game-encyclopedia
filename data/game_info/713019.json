As a testament to working on Asphodel for seven months, I would like to share some of my progress with you. If you have seen my Ruins of Mounri Archive, you would know that I was working on that game for two years before I ended development. So Asphodel, while only in development for Seven months, has been built using some of the 2+ years of code and knowledge I have learned.</p>\n\r\nWhat Can I Expect?\r\n<p>Well, not much. World generation is completely random and so far has no structure for chunking or biomes, it is all a mess. The character can be customized to a degree but that is it. There are a few mobs in the game (mimics and slimes) but they do not spawn naturally.\u00a0<strong>THIS IS A VERY BARE-BONES BUILD</strong> meant to show off MY progress in these seven months and to allow the public to view it as well.\u00a0<strong>THE GAME IS IN NO PLAYABLE STATE</strong>, infact, it is less playable than my last (abandoned) game, Ruins of Mounri. The progress has been mostly \"under the hood\" so to speak. But I am making progress with this game.</p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>[The following is taken from my\u00a0personal website;\u00a0https://micahthemaniac.com/asphodel]\r\n</p>\r\nA Survival Game in the Making\r\n<p><strong>Inspired by the likes of Forager, Minecraft, Terraria, and Animal Crossing.\u00a0</strong>Named after the fields of\u00a0<em>Asphodelos</em>\u00a0in the Greek Underworld,\u00a0<em>Asphodel</em>\u00a0plans to offer a unique survival experience featuring scary monsters and odd mechanics such as sanity. The game is still in development, hold tight! [View the progress on Trello]\r\n</p>\r\nMy New Game\r\n<p>Continuing where I left off with\u00a0<em>Ruins</em>, I started the project in\u00a0<strong>May of 2021</strong>. Inspired heavily by\u00a0<em>Forager</em>\u00a0I decided to work right away on some assets.\r\nSome of the system from\u00a0<em>Ruins of Mounri</em>\u00a0like the lighting, camera, and AI will be reused and repurposed in\u00a0<em>Asphodel</em>.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f267767e0fd01827675a761a78eff9a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MicahTheManiac Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
