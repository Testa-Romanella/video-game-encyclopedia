Press the 'check' button to score your word. Then choose where to start your next turn.</p>\n<p>Options: there's a choice of topics available. One or two players (local hotseat only). You can choose whether the words spread in all directions or just left-right. You can also enable scoring for words not officially in the puzzle if they are in the dictionary, which makes it easier to knock the other player off the grid in multiplayer game. The dictionary should be family-friendly but please let me know if you spot any oddities.</p>\n<p>The dictionary is in British English. The core word lists are aimed roughly at an infant\u00a0school audience (5-7 years).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:50:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/3204044dba44fa6b65300269f9a48682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CoastalGuineaPig"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
