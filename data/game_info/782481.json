This is the first time working on a translation project together and our first LocJAM too.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mustazzeddus </strong>team is composed of three Translation students from Sardinia, Italy, hence the squad name. Mustazzeddu is a typical simple dish from southern Sardinia made with flour, yeast, tomato, garlic, basil, cheese (in some recipes), and absolutely no Labyrinthian meat, we swear. You can take a glance of it on the cover image!</p>\n<p>Working on the game lines we tried to keep it faithful but we also had to get creative, that's why you'll find that the \"flat guy\" has an accent from the Italian Piedmont region; we also tried to come up with new puns, new pickup lines for Xandar, and changed the nationality of a few characters (Maria was already Italian so we made her French). We also decided to change the names of the \"Knobb Family\", while keeping the wordplays in Italian.</p>\n<p>We hope it came along well since we have basically no experience but we were very passionate about it and the game was absolutely super funny and hilarious (we need a sequel).</p>\n<p>The team is composed by: <strong>Elisa</strong>, <strong>Francesca </strong>and <strong>Matteo</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>This work is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.</em></p>\n<p><em>The LanaPixel font (c) 2020, eishiya (https://mastodon.art/@eishiya)\u00a0is licensed under the\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T06:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2dca18bd18bc283969a78de4e9e5c1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mustazzeddus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
