Updated graphics (taken from the Amiga version mostly), a grand new SID from the grand master Magnar Harestad, lovely player sprites from the talented Robert Ramsay, and cobbled together code from myself.</p>\n<p>The full game source code is available here:\u00a0https://github.com/GeorgRottensteiner/MegaSisters . It requires the current WIP version of C64Studio to support the enhanced graphic modes.</p>\n<p>Awesome SID music! Gorgeous sprites! 16 stages of tough Jump'n'Run, like the gods intended!</p>\n<p>And chances for a mighty spruced up version later.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Since the real machine is not out yet (but will be in a few weeks), to play you need the Mega65 emulator Xemu. Due to licensing issues setting up the emulator is a tad cumbersome, but it's worth it (here's an explanation on what to do:\u00a0https://www.stevencombs.com/xemu-on-mac)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b180e1f9333dfea4fc246117462ddace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endurion"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
