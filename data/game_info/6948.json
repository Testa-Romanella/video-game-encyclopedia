It's a pretty frantic affair.\u201d -Blake of Touch Arcade<br/><br/>\u201cKerplinkus promises retro take on match-based puzzle play... mixing the old with the new... [in] a distinctly old skool flavour.\u201d -Keith Andrews of Pocket Gamer<br/><br/>\u201cIs very, very addictive. Prying yourself away from the game proves very difficult. It has high replay potential and will offer many hours of entertainment.... This is a must-buy for casual puzzle game players.\u201d -Linda Ta of AppSafari<br/><br/>\u201cIf you love playing casual puzzle games on your iPhone or iPod touch such as Bejewelled or Trism then [this] is definitely worth taking a look at.... If games like Pac Man, Space Invaders and Tetris still have a place in your heart then Kerplinkus could definitely find its way on to your homescreen.\u201d -Phil Wheeler of AppAdvice<br/><br/>\u201cThis tile-matching game sets itself well apart from competing products, due to its hectic gameplay, muted art style, and classic SID-chip soundtrack.... It is actually very different from the normal mode of thinking.... A really nice effort by the crew at [Kranky Robot].\u201d<br/>-AppGamers.com<br/><br/>Kerplinkus is a completely new take on the casual puzzle game. It's like spinning plates. You must focus on ALL 8 columns or 1 will grow out-of-control. No match 3. No movement restrictions. No special-blocks. Swap ANY 2 blocks anywhere, anytime. Just focus on removing blocks, not creating them.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Retro Audio: Old school music and sound effects.<br/>- Retro Graphics: Color cycling and simple graphics to achieve that retro vibe.<br/>- iPod Music: Play your own music in the background.<br/>- Mute Audio: Kerplinkus(tm) respects the iPhone\u2019s ring/silent switch.<br/>- Volume Control: Conveniently adjust the volume from the option menu or the pause screen.<br/>- Game Center.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/862165317050bea79c32baf93b3be4b8.jpeg", "website": "http://www.krankrobot.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kranky Robot"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kranky Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
