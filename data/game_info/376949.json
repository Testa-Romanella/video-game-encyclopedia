Mikoto\u2019s mother, Himiko, is the leader of these foxgirls, and she commends immense magical powers.<br />\nAs the daughter of an illustrious woman, Mikoto is expected to train hard, and one day take her mother\u2019s place \u2013 but there\u2019s a catch. Mikoto is a complete failure of a foxgirl!<br />\nDespite being twenty-five years of age, Mikoto only has one tail. She fumbles even the simplest of spells, and her hand-to-hand combat skills are laughable. She routinely loses mock battles against her tutor, Ohana, and the other foxgirls in her clan shun and mock her owing to her ineptitude.<br />\nUnsatisfied with her mundane life in Yamatai, Mikoto dreams of leaving home and speaking to the humans that live in the nearby Warren Village. Mikoto has heard humans are wicked and untrustworthy, but Mikoto is an optimist at heart, and she\u2019s sure humans can\u2019t be as bad as the stories say.<br />\nAnd so, on one dark night, Mikoto runs away from her home to attend the annual harvest festival in Warren Village. There, she meets a beautiful knight called Juni, and she is irrevocably drawn to her. An intense, passionate relationship soon blossoms between the pair\u2026<br />\nBut foxgirls like Mikoto aren\u2019t welcome among humans, and Ohana is determined to get her runaway pupil back, no matter the cost.<br />\nCan Mikoto and Juni\u2019s love work out, or is it doomed to failure? That depends on you!<br />\nMikoto is a cheerful, outgoing foxgirl with a zest for life. Adventurous and inquisitive, Mikoto wants nothing more than to explore the world around her \u2013 but how can she, when her tutor is so very controlling?!<br />\nAs Mikoto has few friends, she gets overly attached to Juni from the get-go. She\u2019s pushy and insistent, and perhaps her advances are a tad inappropriate\u2026 but she\u2019s pure at heart, and apologizes whenever she goes too far.<br />\nOhana is Mikoto\u2019s tutor. She\u2019s a forest nymph who\u2019s lived for several centuries, and she possesses immense magical power that rivals even that of Mikoto\u2019s mother, Himiko.<br />\nOhana is a stern woman, and she takes her duties as Mikoto\u2019s tutor very seriously. She\u2019s the first to rebuke Mikoto whenever she makes a mistake \u2013 but she loves her charge a great deal, and wants only the best for her.<br />\nJuni is a softly-spoken human who lives in Warren Village. She served in the army for several years, and her skills with a sword are impeccable.<br />\nThough Juni often wears armor and wields a blade, she\u2019s a kind soul and generous soul who can\u2019t bear to see people in need. Juni has a strong sense of justice, and she\u2019s willing to fight for what she believes is right, even if it comes at the risk of alienating herself from her fellow humans.<br />\nFeature:<br />\n- Join Mikoto on her adventure to discover a new world<br />\n- Soon available in Chinese<br />\n- Change the outcome of the story with your choices</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d3161244aac3d91551e5e96bab4ee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 126, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 439, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
