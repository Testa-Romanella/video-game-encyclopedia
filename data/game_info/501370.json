(the number of monsters on screen at the same time is limited)<br/>The HERO player can jump around and shoot the monsters trying to figure out an opening in the MONSTERS plan.</p>\n<p>The game really shines when both players know how the other thinks.</p>\n<p><strong>MODES</strong><br/><strong>1-Versus Mode:</strong> Control either the HERO or MONSTERS competing in a best of 3, 5 or 7 rounds.
