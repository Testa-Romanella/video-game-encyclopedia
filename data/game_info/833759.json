The goal of ODJ is to  create a   simple game in one day with a time  budget of 8-9h. I did not succeed this time<br/></p>\n<p>Extra rules for ODJ that I follow:       </p>\n<ul><li>One scene - no multiple levels, just one screen;  \r\n</li><li>No music, sound, effects, options - this saves time and I'm lazy;  \r\n</li><li>Very simple game idea - simple enough to port to mobile without adding onscreen joysticks and button clusters [failed];\r\n</li><li>Use Unity or any high-level game engine - saves a bit of time :)  \r\n</li></ul>\n<p> This is my 5th ODJ and I  plan to do more of these. That's why this one is dated 08.08. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T08:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f074ee773c9e6112d1098d135bcfc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CRA Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
