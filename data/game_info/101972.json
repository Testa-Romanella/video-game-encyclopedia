That means taking advantage of the ability to look around in any direction and having good spatial awareness. This led to investigating a weightless environment that allowed freedom of movement in any direction.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>I wanted interaction unique to the finger tracking of the Leap. Something that could not be done compellingly with a mouse, keyboard or game pad. The idea of gently nudging and inspecting objects in micro gravity would be very difficult with a traditional control scheme but with the Leap it feels really natural.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>In VR, with positional tracking, parallax is strongest in the near range so most of the game's interactions happen within arm's reach. Being able to bob your head around (and sometimes walk entirely around) an object really makes it seem as though it's there.</li>\n</ul><br/>\r\nInstructions\r\nWatch this short 'How To' video to get the best tracking out of your Leap make sure your audio is on!<p>\r\n\tBest experienced sitting on a swivel chair or standing up (be careful and clear space!).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t[R] to recenter\r\n</p><p>[Enter] in intro scene to start experience</p><p>[S] in intro scene to skip intro/tutorial</p><p>\r\n\t[ESC] to quit\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t[F10] to toggle black smear correction (thanks Drash!)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOculus Rift DK2 and mounted Leap Motion required.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tRecommended hardware (developed on):\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Nvidia GTX 770, </em><em>Intel i5 - 4670K, 4GB RAM, Windows 8.1</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>DirectX 11 required.</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\tRun in DirectToRift mode for best performance.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMac build is untested (please comment if you try it!)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThank you to the Leap Motion team for running the 3D Jam and answering all my emails.
