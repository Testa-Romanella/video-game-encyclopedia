Everything in the game is pretty much completed. 5 themed levels. 50 levels in total. 4 playable characters. I am in the middle of creating the pick ups and fixing the bombs. Thats the only issue I have with this in Game Maker. I havent been able to fix these issues yet. Rarely also. While bombing the random walls, the exit will not appear at all on some levels. Which may need a soft exit and restart. As ive been struggling with this the past few months. I have decided to wait a while to finish my Dizzy remake game, and come back to this later on when my brain decides to understand coding a little better. Work in progress. I will come back to this. Ive uploaded a version of the game I am currently at. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a18013097128bf184ec20e93d89d175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craig A.
