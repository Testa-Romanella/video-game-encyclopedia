Load a cannon by bringin' <strong>ammo</strong> t' th' cannon, then ye need t' get a <strong>rammer</strong> and push down th' ammo. ye should then put th' <strong>rammer back whar ye took it</strong> t' keep thin's nice and tidy on th' deck. Now hold tight and get ready fer a blast. If ye have good aim ye should hear th' agonizin' scream o' a sea monster, by Blackbeard's sword! <br/></p>\n<p>Firin' a cannon may be a blast hehe, but ye should keep an eye on th' lookout fer potential dangers, I'll warrant ye! If ye think thin's be in a terrible condition, use th' wheel without th' Cap'n's permission, as long as th' ship be safe, he won't mind.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/591/591dc21136555bf5b389e877bfe5e6f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MartensCedric"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
