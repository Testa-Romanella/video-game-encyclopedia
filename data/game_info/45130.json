Every weather scenario can result in a totally different<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0gameplay, f.e: calm scenario makes problems for sailing, wet scenario makes managing<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the fire a challenge.<br/>\u2022 <strong>Latitude based</strong> weather and season - the actual weather is depending not only from the<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0actual day of the year, but also from the players actual latitude. This can result in an<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interesting scenario: if the player on the northern latitudes is afraid of a colder<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0temperatures\u00a0\u00a0during winter, he can set sail and travel to the southern latitudes where<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the next season will be the summer.<br/>\u2022 <strong>Complex</strong> temperature system (sun, shadow, wind, rain \u2026) - the player can sense the<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0temperature as in real life: from the sun he must hide to the shade, when he is wet he <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will dry up faster on the wind and on the direct sun, but when it is cold the direct wind<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0can make him 'freeze'.Fire and Wet\u2022 <strong>Dynamic</strong> - the fire engine reacts to the environment and to the used burnable material:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Wind - the wind accelerates the burning speed but can also make the igniting much<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0harder. In some cases it is needed to shield the fire from the wind.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Rain - the rain makes the used material wet and it degrades the fire quality. If the fire is <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not placed under a roof or the trees fronds, it can be extinguished by the rain.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Wet - the quality of the fire is depending from the 'wet' property of the used materials. <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All burnable materials can get wet on the rain or under the sea. Of course, they are <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drying up on the sun or in the wind.Building and Crafting\u2022 <strong>Blueprints</strong> - the game uses <strong>three stage</strong> building/crafting:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- place the blueprint<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- insert the needed materials - what the player sees in the placed blueprint, that he must<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'insert' to the blueprint to progress in building<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- finalize the building/crafting - some blueprints are needing certain amount of hits by<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0some tool to finalize the processSailing\u2022 <strong>Realistic</strong> sailing mechanic - the traveling was never easy! For traveling the player will need<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wind, knowledge, sail and rudder.<br/>- <strong>Sail</strong> - makes the raft moving. The force it makes depends on how high it is pulled up<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and how it is rotated compared to the wind direction. There will be available many sail<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0types with different wind catching capabilities. In heavy storm it is advisable to lower<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0sail because it can be torn and blown away by the wind.<br/>- <strong>Rudder</strong> - turns the raft to desired directionRaft\u2022 <strong>Modular</strong> rafts - raft can be anytime modified, dismantled, its components reused to build a<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0better, faster, heavier water vehicle<br/>\u2022 <strong>Building</strong> on rafts - player can build shelters on his raft or can convert his plain raft to a<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0houseboat (used also by native people or indians in that times). When traveling long<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0distances it is essential to have shelter on the raft to protect the player from: direct sun, <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rain, wind.Custom\u2022 realistic sun, moon and celestial bodies movement based on latitude and the season - <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0can you spot a total eclipse of the Sun or Moon?
