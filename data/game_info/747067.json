But hunting dark powers without much vision takes a toll in your mind, and you slowly see innocent people and random objects as ghosts themselves. If you are not careful, you can lose all morale and die in your goal. Kill a ghost in every level to progress, and interact with objects and people to recover. Best of luck, ghost hunter!</p>\n\n<p>Move with WASD, attack with left-click, interact with right click, and switch weapons with scroll.</p><p>Thank you ExpoDev for the background music tracks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/9810c9873972ad7b4058000e548f5a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
