The game is about solving puzzles in first-person to get from room to room as you need to flee from scary entities. You won't be having any weapons, so be quick about it!</p><p>In its current pre-alpha version there is a lot of features and content missing or not finished yet, so please be patient.</p><p>The game is optimized for being played on OSX with an Oculus Rift DK2 in 75Hz mode (for an optimal experience, use \"Extended mode\", no mirroring and start the app from the DKs screen in 1920x1080px resolution). The current Windows version is not tested.</p><p>If you want to play the game with a DK1, just imagine it to be a lot darker ;) You also might want to click the \"-\" key (minus/dash) on your keyboard to disable dynamic resolution adjustment, for a crisper image.</p><p>A connected game pad with two analogue sticks is required (tested with a Xbox 360 controller). Recommended, but optional is the use of a Leap Motion controller, mounted to the front of the Rift (to solve the puzzle it is currently also required). This will add extra presence to the experience.</p><p>Release notes v0.3.3:</p><p>- fixed some minor issues</p><p>- improved grabbing and releasing objects</p><p>- crouch feature in (B) button and C key, also added note in manual sequence in the beginning</p><p>- updated to latest leap sdk (windows7/8 hotfix)</p><p>- restricted ceiling light to be grabbable for a certain distance only</p><p>- ovr cameras will be reset to current position/orientation when room level starts</p><p>- added _DirectToRift.exe (hopefully works, but is not tested)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e8/1e83f613901cb7008fc3787037fc6af6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FIERY THINGS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
