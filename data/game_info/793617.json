Your main goal is collecting idiotic looking low poly heads because that's what the developer want you to do, and if you don't like it - I don't care (lol). Now, after you completely waisted 2 miniutes of your life reading this description, go download this game and give it 5 stars so that it'll get popular and more people will play it. Thanks for reading, now go and somehow enjoy this idiotic game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T21:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18950c8d7d17df600a17b8bbf306494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Good K"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
