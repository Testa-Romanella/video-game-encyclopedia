The red chorus weapon is more aggressive, however the blue one is more survivable. Each aircraft will give you different chorus abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPoints you earned in each battle are converted into resources for enhanced weapons that you can use to earn permanent upgrades outside of combat, which can increase the aircraft's damage  and extend its attack range. The better you (and your partner) perform in battle, the faster you'll make your aircraft stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrustrating boss fight!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWarning: they are so damn strong that you may smash the gamepad or keyboard!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAgain, we recommends using gamepads! It's really hard!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEmail: CGS@zjwinturn.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T12:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/437e7ad35aa7cbb72ca978db71e4bd17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Syndrome interactive", "Cat God Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HeyBox Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
