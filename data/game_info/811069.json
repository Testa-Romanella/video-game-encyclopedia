{"id": 811069, "slug": "project-dragon-v20", "name": "Project Dragon V2.0", "name_original": "Project Dragon V2.0", "description": "<p>Project Dragon is a top-down JRPG\u00a0about a Hero that is on a mission to investigate strange activities\u00a0that have been happening on the island. The guild has sent you as you are the best of the best, and they are confident you will solve the mysteries of the island. Throughout your journey, you will encounter many difficult trials and challenges.\u00a0\u00a0You have about 7 days before the island is entirely consumed, so you will need to manage your time and resources carefully.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>To start off,\u00a0this game is my very first attempt at making a fully completed video game. I have never done anything like this before, and this game, to me, is a great achievement.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Project Dragon was actually the 2nd version of a game I made a while back. It was called Wyvern's Curse, but due to thematic issues, I had to change the name. But that wasn't the only thing that was changed. Over the last few months, I took the foundation of the previous version and refined it to what we have right now. Tons of small, yet impactful changes have been made to suit the overall theme of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by other famous JRPGs such as Persona and Octopath Traveler.\u00a0 I have always been a fan of games about time management and having the player do whatever they want, so I really tried to make something close to that. So if you think you like the sound of that, I hope you would enjoy the game I made.</p>\n<p>As of right now, the game is officially finished. However, if there are any game-breaking bugs or balancing issues, I will release some minor updates here and there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/307598552e8f1fcefc6ac3597fcf243a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wasome02"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
