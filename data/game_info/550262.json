This issue will cause the talking text to be displayed slower and may cause Jo to teleport upstairs to the baby\u2019s room at the start of the game (instead of walking to the kitchen).\u00a0 Otherwise the game should still be functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits (</strong>Game Design and Development):\u00a0<strong>Patato1212</strong>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<strong>RoadDust</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings:\u00a0</strong>May contain unsettling scenes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb966220d8e5cf547d210e53285fac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoadDust"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
