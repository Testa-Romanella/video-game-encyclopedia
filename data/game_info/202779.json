Into The Wind is an experimental game made to have users learn when they are stressed. It utilises player input to receive information and change the game accordingly. Into The Wind is designed for users to help them rocognise when they're stressed and to take that knowledge into the real world to help them manage their own stress in any situation. To beat the game, the users must calm themselves in order to progress through the levels naturally. While most games will have you progress from an easy difficulty to harder difficulty, Into The Wind does the opposite, players start on the hardest difficulty, and must overcome their stress in order to make it to the easier difficulties. Once the player beats the easiest difficulty, the game ends.<br/><br/>Developed as the final project of the 5th Trimester of my Games Design degree at SAEQ Brisbane.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["IronPumba"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
