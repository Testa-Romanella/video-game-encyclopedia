Early power-up are things such as getting a physical body, which adds the affects of gravity, as well as other advancements towards a physical-bodied\u00a0sentient being.</p>\n<p>The current version is essentially a vignette of only the starting scene. The player cannot really do anything in the current state, but the sound and design should give an impression of artistic direction. (The next immediate update will be the player breaking loose from the fuse-like object that contains the player, and getting the first upgrade)</p>\r\nAdditional Details\r\n<p>Developed using Godot. All assets created during game jam.</p>\n<p>Used Godot HTML5 export for playable game, which requires Google Chrome with no ad blockers to work.</p>\n<p>Repo:\u00a0https://github.com/bentok/metro</p>Credits<p>sir-bentok</p><p>omegahammer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46df77f07508630ab49290937a973665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sir-bentok"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
