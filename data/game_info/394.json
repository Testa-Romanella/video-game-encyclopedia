High-definition graphics that fully utilize the iPhone 4 Retina display.<br />\n\u201cThis is a game that flaunts a lot of bling - slick visuals, functional controls, challenging missions - and it far surpasses any previous effort at open world gameplay on iPhone. \u201c (PocketGamer. 8/10, Silver Award).<br />\n&quot;The iPhone has so far seen both 2D (Car Jack Streets) and 2.5D (Payback) GTA clones but, as yet, iPhone gamers have not had a fully 3D world in which to wreak the particular sort of inner-city mayhem that has made the genre so popular. Thanks to Gameloft, that&#39;s about to change.&quot; (Touch Arcade)<br />\n&quot;An open-world crime epic is pretty ambitious for the iPhone (\u2026) but it looks like Gameloft has assembled the tech to make it happen&quot; (IGN)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Move to the West Coast and immerse yourself in L.A. gang life with Gangstar. Explore more realistic environments than ever for a unique gameplay experience.

Feel free to complete missions at your own pace, or just do absolutely anything you want!<br />\n- The first iPhone game that displays such a high level of graphics: a full-3D reconstruction of an entire city with detailed buildings, beautiful landscapes and impressive cars that animate and take crash damage.<br />\n- Get rich or die trying!
