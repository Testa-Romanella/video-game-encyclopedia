It's about planting some flowers, and taking care of them while you're\u00a0watching them grow. You have to water them, YEET the weed outta there and fertilise them if you want them to grow faster. When they're finished, they can be\u00a0harvested and sold to get more seeds or fertiliser.\u00a0 Your goal is to get to 200 flowers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c2/0c29fd344f734c79fbc590016c17ad3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeanderDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
