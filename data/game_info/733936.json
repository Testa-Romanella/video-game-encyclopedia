As tasks get completed, the apartment becomes darker and more claustrophobic. There is always an item you need to interact with in order to complete any given task. After some time, you might get a chance to go for a walk outside.</p>\n<p>However, there is a way out of this. Discover the secret light. There are two endings in total.<br/></p>\n<p><em>The idea for this game came out of dealing with depression while being in quarantine in Germany between October 2020 and May 2021. The title is a German word with a number of meanings: it can denote something being closed, but it\u2019s also the word for \u201ctoo\u201d as in \u201ctoo much\u201d. It is also used for infinitive verbs, such as \u201cto wait\u201d, \u201cto sleep\u201d, \u201cto work\u201d. Much like the game, the word is also very short.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a6d8b158c5eff38c06dc6a5454aa2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Luis0n7i"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
