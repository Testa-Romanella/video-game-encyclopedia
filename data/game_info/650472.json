{"id": 650472, "slug": "transcendent-you", "name": "Transcendent You", "name_original": "Transcendent You", "description": "<p>I had a project back then for my mathematics subject wherein we were tasked to create something to be used to teach about a certain mathematical topic using a platform\u00a0related to our academic strand STEM. I used the form of video game, visual novels to be exact, as my platform to teach about Transcendental Functions.</p>\n\n<p>Featuring all the digital art I've drawn, coded everything on my own. It is quite dated compared to what I can do now since this was all done back in 2017. The soundtracks used were from Your Name and Haikyuu!! OSTs, which was such a hit during that time, I don't plan making any money out of this due to copyright. Featuring some photos in my campus as backgrounds, you'll see a photo of my teacher at that time as well as a funny reference, I could say I made a pretty concise game (although the plot may be pretty cliche) and I'm pretty proud of this as the first game I've ever made in my life.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I have decided to upload the game here to have a permanent archive of it online. Feel free to download it and play if you'd like. It is quite a mathematical tutorial with a sprinkle of shoujo romance. I wish you luck on the exam I wrote here!</p>\n<p>Regards,\u00a0rhenoa24</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b85ef40526caa17b85c04be47ca7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rhenoa24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
