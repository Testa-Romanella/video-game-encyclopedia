Can she really get through all the items on her 'how to properly enjoy my youth! \u2661' checklist when it's been untouched for over a year?? A thriving social life might be a bit of a stretch, but surely, she can manage to make a few friends, right?</p>\n<p>...Right??</p>\n\n<p>Read 'I became a proper member of society and even got a girlfriend before graduation?!' to find out!</p>\n\n<p>_______________________________</p>\n\n<p>This version is a short (extremely short, ten minutes at best) demo for Yuri Game Jam 2022.
