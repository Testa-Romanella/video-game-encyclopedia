Use their memories to find the right potato before time is out! If you meet the right potato, then that's definitely a small world.</p><p>This is my first compo game and I hope you have fun playing it! I had fun making it so that's a beginning. Feedbacks appreciated :)!</p><p>You can also rate the game on its LD page: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/$25346</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce40af306118bff3c950b72621823da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lagrume Masque"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
