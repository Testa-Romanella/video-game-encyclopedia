Take control of nearby nodes to claim their resources. Watch out for the swarms, as they infect everything they touch.</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Click on nodes</strong> to select them, right click on others to link them together. ( Note:\u00a0<em>The Colony node, the one you start with, can link up to 3 nodes, while all others can only link 1\u00a0</em>)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Claim nodes</strong> by linking them together. <strong>Neutralize enemy nodes</strong> by keeping a unit on them while not being attacked.<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>Making units</strong> requires 1 population each. Gain more population by taking other nodes and staying alive for a cycle (cycles are 120s).<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>Move units</strong> by selecting them and right clicking where you want them to move. They will attack if you right-click on an enemy or if they collide with each other.</p>\n<p>- If the <strong>special button</strong> becomes available ( When the observer node is selected ), you can right-click on another node to have it scout (reveal)\u00a0that node.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER'S NOTE: The game is in a very playable state, but I ran out of time to develop it. It isn't quite where I wanted it to be, so things like resources, scouts, and other nodes are pretty much useless in the game. Nonetheless, I'm still very proud of its current state. Please enjoy!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc2ddbf9c3ed056f2fb96d7f0251351a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gmanicus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
