{"id": 113923, "slug": "sqrxz", "name": "Sqrxz", "name_original": "Sqrxz", "description": "<p>Sqrxz requires fast reflexes and is a simply mindblasting Jump'n'Run puzzle game with high frustration factor originally made in 1996 by Marcus Vesterlund (Maze) and John Holmvall (Hojo) for DOS and Windows 9x.</p>\n<p>Sqrxz (2010) is a remake of a game with the same name and has been created by Rodolphe Boixel (Thor), Shahzad Sahaib (Kojote), Simon Butler and Brendan Ratliff (Syphus). Minor support came from Marcus Vesterlund himself who also gave permission to redo his game. Denny M\u00fcller (Mulle) supported the team with a WordPress-Theme for the official page and Rabia Sahaib (Mahek) made three more levels.</p>\n<p>A remake should be usually bearing improvements, so does Sqrxz 2010. Beside the \"classic\" graphic mode, there is a new mode with \"deluxe\" graphics. The main gameplay has modified in a way that you need to collect all items to open the door at the end of each level, which makes some levels harder than they actually already were. Extended \"fun\" is guarantueed with additional three levels, unseen before. Each level does have it's own chiptune and adds up to the retro feeling. A Top 10 highscore table will hold all your records. For the ones who like hidden features, there is even a small easter egg!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/82926ec502fff9d2ba83ae90c2df3611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Retroguru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
