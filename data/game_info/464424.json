As he makes his way home, his imagination runs out of control with images of spooky monsters and occurrences.</p>\n<p>Hi Everyone,</p>\n<p>I put this together for the GMTK game jam 2020. The theme was \"Out Of Control\". This was my first time doing a game jam and my first publicly released game ever. It was made in Godot. I ran into some issues through out the jam (as expected) which led to a mostly unfinished product. I hope you all enjoy what I was able to implement in the 48 hours and look forward to creating some cool complete games in future jams.<br/></p>\n<p>- Joey DiGiorgio<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e35/e352dd20fbbacb39be91023d52180c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["digiorgiojoey@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
