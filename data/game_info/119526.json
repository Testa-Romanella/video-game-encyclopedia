The theme was \"shapeshift\". </p>Post jam version <p>\tThe post jam version adds a difficulty level selector. Press LB or Tab to switch between RELAX (new, easier mode) and CHALLENGE (basically the same as the original version). They have separate high scores and leaderboards. <br/></p><p>\tWe also increased the top scores list to 20 names. Hopefully now everybody can enjoy the game without being too frustrated, regardless of their skill level. Have fun! <br/></p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tProgramming and graphics: Andrea Pantaloni\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tMusic and SFX: Katalin Negretti\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAdditional graphics: Tommaso Pantaloni\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cdb262732def9966c30bcdfa5dea91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["A.
