Build your tower (arrow keys) to reach as high into the sky as you can, balancing and unbalancing it in order to counteract God\u2019s attempt to knock your unstable tower over with the wind.\r\n</p><p>NOTE: The original version of this game submitted to Ludum\u00a0Dare 49 had a problem with using too much VRAM and it bugged on some computers. The hotfix is identical in terms of gameplay and visuals, just has a behind-the-scenes fix so the game is compatible with more computers.</p>\n<p>-Credits-\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming by: Teo Miklethun &amp; Iyan Siwik\r\n</p>\n<p>Spritework by: Enharmonics (with some assistance from Teo Miklethun)\r\n</p>\n<p>Music by: Teo Miklethun\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee56fc6c012c99e29239cd1ba25fa0f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locally Genius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
