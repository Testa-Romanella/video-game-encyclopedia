Click the people to squish them with the duck.\u00a0<br/>Click the \"F2\" button to switch to a squishy person spawner.<br/>Click the \"F3\" button to spawn hamburgers. Squishy people like hamburgers.</p>\n<p>Made for:</p>\r\nUntitled Game Jam #37\r\n<p>Technical Notes:<br/></p>\n<p>There's stuff missing but since this was just a burst of inspiration kinda thing I doubt it will ever be fixed or updated. There's no sound or music, the \"F1\", \"F2\" and \"F3\" buttons don't actually connect to the keys on your keyboard. Spawning too many things(Like, thousands of people making tens of thousands of blood splats) will bog your machine. I wanted to make a deceivingly good trailer but since I only put maybe 5 hours into the game it would be wrong to spend 10 hours on a trailer. The people kinda wiggle off the hamburgers sometimes. This is a neat feature I left on purpose because people are just like that sometimes. There's some more features and stuff I wanted to add but I'm not going to.</p>\n<p>Source Notes:<br/><br/>This was made with Game Maker Studio Professional Edition V.1.4.9999. It MIGHT run in GMS2 but don't get all mad if it doesn't. There's no real interesting or useful bits of genius in here, maybe 70% of it was made with drag and drop. Another 25% COULD have been made with drag and drop but sometimes scripts are just easier. That last 5% needed scripting and is where you will find the useful bits for whatever project you're working on. All code and assets were made by me and are open to use, free of charge, for whatever you want,\u00a0forever; with a single stipulation on if you make something with what you find or learn from my code, drop me a comment so I can geek out about it.<br/><br/>Credits Due:<br/>The people sprites are friends from my facebook, I knew I would need assets when the time came so, months ago I offered an open deal, if they liked my post I would draw a sprite of them based off a template and possibly use it in a game. 22(Or more, I think I lost some, SORRY Ricky and Aaron!) people took me up on the offer and their likeness has now been added to my asset catalog. Thank you for letting me steal your style everyone!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce28e8aac74522853dc25664dcb14d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["refundable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
