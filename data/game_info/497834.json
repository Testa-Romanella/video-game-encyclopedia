I mainly focused on movement and physics, with basic level design being a secondary focus. However, there are a few other systems in place that can be improved on or developed further such as an interaction system and other movement mechanics. If you are interested in taking these core systems and building them out into your own thing, feel free to email me and I will set you up with the project files.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, thank you for checking this out and have a good day</p>\n<p>Email: tunnellightgames@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Instagram: @tunnellight.games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/368579a9a3eb478128386a16cc8292d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TunnelLight Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
