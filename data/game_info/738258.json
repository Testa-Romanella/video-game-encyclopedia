The narrative explores the mind of a young woman who is overthinking the simple idea of giving her ex-lover his sweater. A player guides her through each scenario in tune with the mind, showing her paths she desperately desires and fears.\u00a0The design shows immediate mouse-over thoughts that pop in quickly, such as in real life. Cycling through all the choices, constantly questioning if that's what is meant to happen to her. Figuring out why the texts in each time are different than the last. Each passage opens new pieces of her thoughts, allowing the mind to shift through time. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/29695fd6a1053aeea60205ade0bc8881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pjmsmoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
