So go grab a friend and give it a try, we believe managed to create something fun and competitive!<br/>I'll try to create a bot later when I get some free time, to give a chance for those who are living in their basements and have no friends, so, drop a follow if you're interested giving it a shot in the future, then you can have a taste what is this all about.</p>\n<p>The main idea with the game was these creatures being summoned by gods for their own amusement. A full game would have different arenas, more abilities/characters, and different Game Modes, and of course, playable online.<br/>We would love to hear from you, feel free to criticize, it might lead us looking back and getting motivation to return to this project!</p>\n<p>The gameplay mechanics consists on dodging and countering attack you opponent moves, these being 3 types of moves: Heavy Attack, Block Attack and Light Attack.<br/>It's a combat triangle, each one beat each other and you must react by its color that the moves visually show you.</p>\n<p>Not only that, you can Cancel/Feint your moves, and every time a round starts, you and your opponent has a Special Ability that can be only used once per match.<br/>You get 1 of the 3 Special Abilities available, but you\u00a0<strong>never</strong>\u00a0know which one you have, instead, the controller tells you which Special Ability your opponent has by its vibrations, so you can consider changing your playstyle every round knowing your opponent ability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong><br/>Pedro Teixeira<br/>Gon\u00e7alo Os\u00f3rio<br/>Miguel Couto</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/557211a2db520ece97df92b69ff19462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The real Careface"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
