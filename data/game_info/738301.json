When the 3 hour mark passed I had the basic gameplay done but nothing more. So I thought to myself: Now that I couldnt finish it in 3 hours I might aswell spend some more hours to make the game pretty. After 8 more hours of programming, creating pixel art and composing a little soundtrack I finished and uploaded the game. And I am happy that I did!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/6570e97c6e925cff4b94763088b6b725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DaveUnbelievable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
