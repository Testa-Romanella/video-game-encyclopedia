It has made death furtive, and the people of the land more resilient. To what end no one knows, but perhaps it means to prolong the people's suffering before the arrival of Yetsabu-Nech?</em> <br/></p>\n<p>These minor rule corruptions are intended to prolong the life of characters and promote campaign play. But remember, it will not save you.</p>\n<p>I've been running a campaign with M\u00d6RK BORG for more than a year with these rules, and with my Death is Not an Escape! supplement. We've had a total of six character deaths and a TPK. With the exception of a player who enjoys throwing himself into the center of carnage, all of those characters are still in play - albeit radically changed by their experiences and injuries. There are things far worse than death. Life is suffering, after all. <br/><br/></p><p>The Longevity Corruption is an independent production by Wayward Polyhedral and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell.
