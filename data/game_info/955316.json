You've just completed your first successful rescue mission. You saved a woman from a demon who entered her subconcious and tried to drive her to insanity. As you return home you begin to notice weird things happening. Your neighbor from the apartment across is obsesively looking at you. Lamps start to flicker, alarm randomly goes off, telephone rings but no one is on the other line.<br/><br/>Welcome to \"The Secret Door\". The demon did not go away. It just decided to migrate in your subconcious. You need to do everything to prevent the demon from entering your soul. Shake wires, stop alarms, reject phone calls and don't open the door to anyone. If you rationalize the paranormal, you will be driven to insanity.</p><p><strong>Minimum System Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>OS:\u00a0WINDOWS\u00ae 7, 8, 8.1, 10<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a0Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i3 or AMD Ryzen\u2122 3<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a06 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 950 or AMD Radeon\u2122 R7 370</li></ul><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed The Secret Door Demo, make sure to wishlist it on Steam to get notified when the full game releases \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udc7f\u271d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a09bca38a5354b8bcd414fd6d8ad23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamProductions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
