I have changed key things from the introduction game such as:</p>\n<p>1. The game background is completely different from the introduction which I have changed.</p>\n<p>2. I have changed the games audio in all aspects.</p>\n<p>3. I have changed the player sprites to a different color flashing lights.</p>\n<p>4. I have included many astroids throughout the game that the player must go around when battling against the enemies.\u00a0 As you can see while playing, the first level is a much easier level and once you enter level two, you will find that it is significantly more difficult with many added enemies and asteroids everywhere so it becomes much more fun to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T16:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42c0c857b8559ef61ea99222361887bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nickgorelik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
