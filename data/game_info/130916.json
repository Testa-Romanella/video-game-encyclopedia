We're working our hardest to fix this!</p><p> Each player will start out with 5 squads, each with their own units to tactically outplay their opposition and dominate the map.</p><p>This game is a multiplayer only game and requires a minimum of 2 players, so don't forget to send a copy to a friend so you can play together!</p><p>Controls are as follows:</p><ul><li>Left Mouse Click to select a Unit.</li><li>Right Mouse Click to select an enemy Unit to attack. Then click the Attack button on the HUD to confirm the attack.</li><li>WSAD to move the camera</li></ul><p>To create a server simply enter a server name and a player name in the \"Create Game\" section of the main menu and click the create button.</p><p>If you don't have a friend willing to play with you. Tweet (or DM) us @M9DevTeam and one of the developers will play a game with you (hopefully we're not busy working on the game!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363159448c2d62c46f7e1e974f0d8393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M9 Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
