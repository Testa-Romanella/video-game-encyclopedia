The player must use the sword to directly and indirectly influence the environment in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. While this mostly involves hacking things up with the sword, violence doesn\u2019t solve everything. You\u2019ll have to think outside the box and work with an unconventional and slimy ally.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-13T14:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3c501d5e561d51ee6227df813a8bae.jpg", "website": "http://www.swordandtheslime.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Possum House Games"], "genres": ["Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Possum House Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
