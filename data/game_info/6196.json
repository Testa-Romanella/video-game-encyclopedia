Please note that you do not need to have played any of the previous gamebooks in order to play this.<br/><br/>\"Cruelly taken from your homeland of Orlandes, you find yourself in a far off land at the mercy of a gladiatorial arena. Somehow trying to find a way to escape overseas, can you also unravel a potentially dangerous mystery that puts two nations on the brink of war?\"<br/><br/>\"My favourite examples so far though are the iPad and iPhone-compatible Gamebook Adventures, a series of lovingly crafted and extremely well-written interactive fantasy novels. It's surprisingly engrossing stuff, the economically written narrative packing in masses of detail, while rattling out a pacy, involving story.\" - The Guardian<br/><br/>\"Slaves of Rema is epic in scope, but doesn't lose sight of the plight of your character. It brings the twists and turns at a satisfying pace, and all of this is supported by the wonderful art we have come to expect from Tin Man Games.\" - Touch Gaming Magazine<br/><br/>\"On the technical side, Slaves of Rema is almost at the level of perfection. The graphics have been optimized for the Retina display and look gorgeous, the interface is easy to understand and use, with the bare minimum of excess buttonry and the dice animations are simply superb.\" - TouchMyApps<br/><br/>\"I can't help but feel a certain nostalgia for these four interactive books. Without noticing it, I got sucked into the first one over the Christmas holiday and went back to the previous pages and cheat reading different plots.\" - App Freak<br/><br/>Gamebook Adventures 3: Slaves of Rema is the third in a series of newly written adventure gamebooks for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now beautifully realised for the iPad!
