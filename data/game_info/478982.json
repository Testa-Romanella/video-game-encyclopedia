The goal is to build up the playing field!<br/>There are 4 Levels, and for anyone who just wants to get to the end: There are 3 hidden cheats that are activated with single button presses. Have fun digging!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little prototype!</p>\n<p>-Aluz</p>\n<p>PS: I don't know why but apparently the fullscreen button has to be hit twice...</p>\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<ul><li>On level 3, there is a bug where blocks sometimes don't activate their collider properly and need to be entered and exited by the ball to do so. This causes blocks to nly build after repeatedly hitting them.</li><li>Sometimes the ball can phase through blocks, this is usually rare.</li><li>Sometimes the ball can get stuck within geometry or in an endless cycle. The game detects this and returns the ball to the paddle. This detection may also return the ball even if it was not stuck on rare occasions.</li></ul>\n<p>Credit goes to these 2 assets that add to the flair:<br/>[Monitor model and frame textures]<br/>[Music: Be Faster - Muz Station Productions]<br/>And thanks to all the playtesters and people that were patient with me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d894935d64409bbbaab4c0aa824f575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alzurana"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
