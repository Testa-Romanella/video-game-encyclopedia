Weave your way through 26 nail-biting, butt-clenching deep space tunnels.<br/><br/>Levels go by fast, and victory is all about deft handling of your inertia and momentum. Ultimately, your goal is to not explode, and you're scored based on how much time is left on the clock when you finish a level.<br/><br/>Asteroid Drift is the definition of easy-to-learn, hard-to-master -- intuitive to pick up and play, but going for gold will keep you flying long after the credits roll.<br/><br/><h3>Easy to learn, hard to master physics</h3>Controlling your ship couldn't be simpler. Press left or right to turn clockwise or counterclockwise, and hold thrust to propel forward. Controllers are supported too, so play whatever way you're most comfortable! But beware, actually mastering control of your spacecraft's inertia is no small feat.<br/><br/><h3>Designed for Time Attack and replay</h3>Asteroid Drift was designed with time attack replay and speedrunning in mind. The faster you complete a level, the higher the medal you'll receive. There's Bronze, Silver, Gold, and maybe even something beyond that if you want to put in the work. Struggling players are also welcome to opt for extra time or hp to practice completing levels before chasing those high score medals.<br/><br/>Asteroid Drift tends to take about 2 hours to roll credits the first time, but 7:21.64 is the speedrun time to beat - \"Nick's Time,\" may it live in infamy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T08:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a21856046dfcd51cf92bbe9478aaf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warder Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Warder Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
