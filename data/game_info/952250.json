This game took me only but 3 weeks to conceptualize, model, program and finally, intergrate all in Unity. This game explores what a non euclidean geometry world looks like. Explore throught the complex as the rooms change, new rooms are added and some are even removed. Try and complete these complex puzzles by thinking out of the box.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7aa9d250487e421364618c52feb0d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derpling"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
