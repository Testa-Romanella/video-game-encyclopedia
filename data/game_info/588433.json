The world of Renova beckons knightly heroes to come forth and vanquish its evil - the time is Nye!</strong><h3>Overview</h3><br/>Renova is a tactical Action-RPG that seeks to provide an innovative experience in gameplay and visual style. A refreshing take on the Action-RPG genre, we introduce a tactical combat system, robust multiplayer modes, and nostalgic fantasy aesthetic.<br/><br/><h3>Game Features</h3><br/>Chief among the game\u2019s unique attributes is the <strong>Per Frame Combat System</strong>. This system segments all player actions, such as attacking, defending, moving and spell-casting, into 1 to 3 second time frames. Players must be wary of how to time their strikes, what decisions to make next, and how to properly predict enemy moves. Distinguished from any run-of-the-mill hack and slash combat, this is the combat that challenges the player, demanding one to be fully immersed and aware of the actions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The world of Renova has depth and expanse. We have a passion to bring it to life and to offer the players a remarkable experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>We look forward to you venturing the world of Renova with us!</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T02:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/7923920d272d8704d54be72f368a0575.jpg", "website": "https://www.renovagame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teutonic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Teutonic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
