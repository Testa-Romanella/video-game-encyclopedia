{"id": 601618, "slug": "four-color-theorem-game", "name": "Four Color Theorem Game", "name_original": "Four Color Theorem Game", "description": "<p>The<strong> Four Color Theorem Game</strong> (or FCTG) is a puzzle game based on a famous mathematical theorem which is really easy to understand, but hard to demonstrate. This theorem states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Also I added some features in game so as to make gameplay more complex (you have to balance colors or some regions are linked). I did this game as an exercice (a large work about <strong>List</strong> and <strong>Array</strong> under Unity), trying without succes to find some scripts allowing to create something more or less similar. I guess that it could be interesting for young students. 30 levels. Have fun ++</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26b4704564729a482dcffb0867681ee6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
