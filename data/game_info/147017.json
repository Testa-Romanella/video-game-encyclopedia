I figured I might as well share it because although it's bare bones there's something about it that I find fun. Maybe one day I'll revisit it and see if I can make something more substantial now I've got experience under my belt.</p><p>Orcs gather outside your castle. Stop them climbing the walls by dropping rocks on their head. If any get to the top, kill them with your sword.</p><p>Axe wielding orcs will try to bash open the doors at the top. Once a door is open bomb orcs will try to get through to blow up the castle (you'll have to use your imagination for the explosion though). Don't let them - that's GAME OVER!</p><p>Kill multiple orcs with one rock to increase your multiplier, and cause treasure chests to appear.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p>Arrow keys - move left and right<br/>Z - Drop rock<br/>X - Swing sword</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/772c26bdf37c92d14857ed136b048e44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bee Bush"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
