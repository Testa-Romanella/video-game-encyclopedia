Do you like puzzles? Look no further, because Puzzle Pelago is a base-building puzzle game!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The islands of the Puzzle Pelago have been devastated by a storm, and now the islanders cannot figure out how everything was laid out! Space is tight on the tiny islands, and roads may not cross - lest the stubborn haulers run into each other!<br/><br/><br/>The core mechanic of Puzzle Pelago is simple - create new workshops by dragging from existing workshops or resources. From a forest, you can drag a lumber jack that produces logs. From a lumber jack, you can drag a saw mill that produces planks. You can even combine two goods to produce a more advanced one: combine ore and coal to produce iron, or tools and planks to produce furniture!<br/><br/>But even though the task starts simple, each island you visit will become more challenging than the previous one! Can you help rebuild them <strong>all</strong>???<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Clean, colorful graphics with juicy and responsive animations<br/></li><li> 50+ Puzzles<br/></li><li> Easy to learn, hard to master<br/></li><li> 13 Different goods</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b7/3b79d253acbb07fa9e742afcb68684a6.jpg", "website": "https://puzzlepelago.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Christopher Mielack"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Christopher Mielack"], "esrb_rating": null}
