{"id": 634805, "slug": "freethem", "name": "FreeThem", "name_original": "FreeThem", "description": "<p>A physics-based multiplayer or single-player game of a convict escaping prison. Play alone or with friends over IP and port forwarding! (17777 I believe...). Drag and drop gameplay mechanics inspired by Portal (but worse) and puzzle-solving aspects like Monument Valley. Play the puzzles to escape! Or be trapped in the prison forever...</p>\n\r\nThe layout of the prison... We are almost free...\r\n\n\r\nHave fun escaping...\r\n\n\r\n...or stay for a while...\r\n<p>Made for MFGJ 2021 Summer</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong>: If you find any bugs or issues, please file a PR or make an issue on GitHub. I will also be checking comments. (There are still many issues with Multiplayer which I can't fix due to the time limit: eg. keys on the keypad not showing up)</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb1f5ba4029db8e2070ff932c653106c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cowland Game Studios", "BotMoooo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
