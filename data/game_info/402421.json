You have to take it down Peppino, I dont want to deal with some nasty demolition man!\". Scared to disobey the fat man in red and to slim out his chance of\u00a0getting a working pizza stove for Christmas, Peppino decides to work\u00a0an extra day to take on this ridiculously morbid tower of spiritual absorption.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>A thanks to the discord community for providing decorations for the demo:<br/></p>\n<p>Pinpan<br/>Toaster-a-power<br/>Greywyrd<br/>wazzuper25<br/>Pnats<br/>Cole's Whatever<br/>potheadedboy<br/>Bucket<br/>MayoTayo<br/>JonGavs<br/>Chronixtu<br/>jekARISUET<br/>fallatious<br/>tocinin<br/>RealNewHours<br/>Goodwholesome<br/>XtremeXavier<br/>Tempo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-25T11:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2eed99e643a2c41ebaaaacd72734f82f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PizzaTowerGuy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
