This project was created during January of that year.</p>\n<p>This month was a short one for me, so I only had about a half month to work on this project. Even so, I was able to finish and release something! I took a bunch of time experimenting with Unity's new Input System, VFX Graph, Shader Graph, and HDRP; all of which were new to me. It's a pretty basic Pong clone, but with a lot of learning stuffed into it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95a812a84554ea62cbd542b187bc7a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
