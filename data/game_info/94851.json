To you it is more than just an engine; it is a maker of dreams. You even quit your day job to make sure you can spend all your day working on that dream game that you\u2019ve always wanted to make.\u00a0<br/><br/>There is, however, a bit of a twist. You are living in your mom\u2019s house, and the only thing that separated you from a delinquent was your day job. Of course she thinks it\u2019s the worst decision you\u2019ve ever made! Even though you always thought in your head that you\u2019d spend months (or maybe even years) to make that ultimate game that\u2019ll blow everyone\u2019s minds away, in comes the ultimatum: You have 60 days to prove that a developer with a passion for making games (you) can use RPG Maker MV to make your living, and that you\u2019re not just another wannabe hobbyist who made the biggest extemporaneous decision of his life.\u00a0<br/><br/>Objective: Use the engine that\u2019s simple enough for a child, but powerful enough for a developer, to create a game within 60 days and raise at least $10,000 (in first month\u2019s sales) to prove your mom wrong.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>- A short 1-2 hour simulation game where every RM developer can find something they can relate to \u2013 and if you\u2019re not a developer \u2013 you\u2019ll learn a thing or two about what goes on behind the scenes.\u00a0<br/><br/>- You are no pro. You\u2019ve made a couple of shabby games with bad grammar and a ton of bugs before, but that\u2019s it. To make something worthwhile you have to learn a lot of things from the scratch while simultaneously working on your dream game. This includes taking lessons, watching tutorials on Youtube, and improving your overall creativity.\u00a0<br/><br/>- Use free plugins and resources from our beloved communities and buy the stuff that you need to make your dream game. (Don\u2019t forget to credit those fine people)\u00a0<br/><br/>- After you\u2019ve learned a certain skill, work on commissions to make money to fund your project\u2019s needs. Hire people to do stuff that you\u2019re not good at.\u00a0<br/><br/>- Increase your game\u2019s publicity before the launch by running marketing campaigns. Your dream game will never become a reality if it doesn\u2019t leave your basement!\u00a0<br/><br/>- Captivating artwork and music.\u00a0<br/><br/>- Bone-tickling humor at every step of your journey to fame.\u00a0<br/><br/>- Five different endings.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/><br/>Website -\u00a0https://www.potatobraingames.com/the-maker-of-dreams\u00a0<br/>Twitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/PotatoBrainG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/1688ea3e29c5c5da55bc2e0c9429a837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PotatobrainGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
