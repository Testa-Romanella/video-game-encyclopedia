Survive the onslaught of colorless enemies using one of the five playable ships, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  But wait, lets not draw the line there. Don't feel like being restricted?  Then go ahead and draw your very own ship using the in-game custom ship maker.  The game features eight types of enemies and five challenging bosses.  How long will you survive?  Don't be a pen pusher, climb the global leaderboards!  Did a friend beat your score?  Back to the drawing board!  This is our very first game, so if you find any bugs, please report them to us, and we will pencil them in.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5fc3ca5e6af0752119b069973cc24a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 35}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Slothzilla Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
