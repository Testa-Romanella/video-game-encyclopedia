The thing is, there are a lot of humans in the way of that nuke and the aliens don't have enough space milk to teleport any alien weaponry with you, so you'll have to use the humans' weapons instead.\u00a0There's also the fact that there isn't enough time to reload, so you'll have to constantly swap between different human weaponry as each weapon's ammo runs out. Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:31:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37dcee8ab684ec16fed145f2a58d2c28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jhckiey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
