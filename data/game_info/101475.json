You have a special gift. You can control this bullet. Your objectives: take jobs, kill, build your reputation, and work your way up the crime ladder.</em></p><p>\r\n\tRide the Bullet is a cross-platform game about speed, quick reflexes, and glorious ragdoll pixel-people death. In it you play as a gun for hire with the ability to steer a bullet. You will fire this bullet through various levels, completing the jobs given to you by your clients. The game includes a series of individual fast-paced steering puzzles where you'll find yourself breaking up shady deals in abandoned warehouses or even assassinating mob bosses in their own homes.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Now includes a functional, but not pristine Oculus Rift build. Enjoi!</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Over 35 levels ranging in difficulty from \"walk in the park\" to \"my fingers don't work anymore and I hate RadJor.\"</li>\n<li>Simple bullet steering mechanic. If you have stubs instead of hands, we've got you covered. The focus is on speed, destruction, and quick reflexes rather than complex controls.</li>\n<li>A gripping tale of love, revenge, deceit, and ragdoll physics.</li>\n<li>A cast of characters, facially acted out by MASSIVELY POPULAR youtubers (like iDubbbz AND MORE), small game devs, gamers, and wild outdoorsmen alike.
