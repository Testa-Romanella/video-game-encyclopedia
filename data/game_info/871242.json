Set your buildings wisely to maximize their combat potential and take advantage of the synergies between them.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>Develop the village you're defending.</strong> Build not only the defense towers but also other <strong>facilities inside your settlement</strong>. Place woodcutter's huts near the forest to gather wood, then build a marketplace to exchange it for stone. Develop your magic schools to get more mana and unlock more powerful spells. Upgrade your gate to damage enemies attacking it and so on...            <br/><br/> <strong>Exchange resources to get the ones you need.</strong> You want to build a specific tower and you lack wood while sleeping on the stone and gold? - <strong>no problem!</strong> (if you're willing to pay the price). The map you're on is rich in one supply while lacking the presence of others? - <strong>Trade!</strong> You're not a mage type? - Turn your mana into gold!    <br/><br/> <strong>Set the plan of an attack for each individual tower.</strong> Order your forces to attack a specific enemy based on 14 unique traits. You can make mage towers target the flying enemies with low health first, and your archers the fastest ones with the strongest magic resistance. It's all in your hands. <strong>Figure out</strong> what works for you once or change your tactic according to the map!            <br/><br/> <strong>Develop your abilities in a way you like</strong>, there are tons of available combinations, you can specialize yourself in getting gold and archery, woodcutting, and melee fighters, or go full resource gathering. The choice is yours. Each branch of the skill tree has new buildings and towers ready to be unlocked!    <br/><br/>Upgrading equipment for your towers in the blacksmith, multiple difficulty levels, troops formations, and powerful spells await...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T04:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e064bb5f0ae99d4cd9638128dd9a5254.jpg", "website": "https://art-games.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avernus Software, Art Games Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Art Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
