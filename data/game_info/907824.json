It's about a shack that houses strange creatures and the entire existence of it doesn't make sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What's the premise of the game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You woke up in the middle of the desert and seek shelter at a shack. But the shack is more than it leads on. It houses many different creatures and it's existence doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p><strong>The game is really short, why?</strong></p>\n<p>It's more of a short project but it having enough substance to get someone's attention. I will probably come back to this at a later date.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T07:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/850f217c7e3183388421d717b1171240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["birbscream"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
