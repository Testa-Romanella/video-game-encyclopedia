{"id": 151976, "slug": "just-fishing-itch-owltears", "name": "Just Fishing (itch) (Owltears)", "name_original": "Just Fishing (itch) (Owltears)", "description": "<p>This game is a short game that was made for the 1 Map Challenge on the RPG Maker Forums. It has no death traps or fighting in it. It was made to test variables so there isn't really an end to it. You can talk to 3 different characters, sell fish, and the game keeps count of how much you've caught!<br/></p>\r\nIt uses:<br/>1 Map<br/>8 VARIABLES<br/>10 Switches<br/>0 Common Events<br/>10 Events\r\n<p>Link to challenge - https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/one-map-game-challenge.94392/</p>\n\n<p><strong>=============<br/>Game Goal:<br/>=============<br/></strong>The goal of the game, is to just fish. There are 5 islands that you can initially go to, and 1 that you can get to later. You CANNOT fish on two of the islands, the one that contains Rusty's Fish Shack, and the unlockable island. On each island you will have your boat, and 3 fishing spots if you can fish on that island, all three are randomized and currently only have 4 fish you can find and 5 items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no true ending, so fish as long as you want while listening to relaxing music and background sounds. (If the background sounds are too loud you can lower their volume!)<br/></p>\r\n You can save at any time! Saving shows you your in game stats!\r\n\n\n<p>Upon start up of a new game, the game will randomly select, WEATHER, TIME, and BACKGROUND MUSIC. There are at least 5 different music tracks, 2 of which only play at night, and 1 on the unlockable island, that will only play when you are on the island. The music and background sound have their own options so you can change them if one is louder then the other.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0All\u00a0items\u00a0and\u00a0images\u00a0are digitally drawn\u00a0by Owtears in a pixel style in Paint, and finished in an old copy of Photoshop.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The items and fish are randomized when you select a spot to fish.\u00a0 You can make the odds better in your favor by upgrading your fishing rod and purchasing the Better Bait. This allows you to have a higher chance of catching larger fish and is the only way to fish up the items in game. You may end up with duplicates of items, if you do so you can get them cleaned or sell them at the shop.</p>\n<p>====================================</p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n<p>====================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Shop Clerk</strong></p>\n<p>A man who runs the Rusty's Fish Shack, the only remaining\u00a0 building of the old town. He sells the player items to get better fish and items. He has a soft\u00a0 and will talk randomly about the area and offer to tell about the old town. He loves bad jokes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jarone</strong></p>\n<p>A young scientist who loves to go metal hunting with his metal detector. He never comes to Fish Scale Lake without his trusty detector. He is found on one of the islands and is trying to find artifacts of the old city that used to reside in the area.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>???</strong></p>\n<p>A mysterious person only found on the unlockable island. They are silent and take a little to get to know well, but may become a friend if given something special. An extremely shy person, they are scared to see you when you first meet.<br/></p>\n\n<p>=============</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this game technically has no end, as I couldn't decide on how to end it ... So just fish as much as you'd like and see how many you can get before you get bored! I'd love to know how many you'll catch!<br/></p>\n<p>=============</p>\n<p><strong>Any feedback about the game and design is appreciated. This is my first completed game attempt! Please remember this is made within the limitations of the One Map Challenge , but I don't mind expanding upon it in the future if wanted.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Known\u00a0Bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>*\"Ending\" dialogue just abruptly stops, but that's due to lack of ideas of conversations. However you can still play the game.</p>\n<p>*Shop Clerk will sometimes say the same thing over and over</p>\n<p><em>That actually is because his random talk is set to a variable number to see what he might say. Keep talking to him and eventually he'll change.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5a79b4ee3e0264ce8506c0aca98205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owltears"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
