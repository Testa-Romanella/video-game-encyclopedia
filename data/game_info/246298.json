Move around kill and don't get killed.<br/>The project itself is based off several tutorials from many sources. (Too many to list them all). So, if you recognize something somewhere in the game, chances are I took it from where you think I took it from. However, the code is mine as the experiment was to make heavy use of ScriptableObjects. There is also the first steps given in experiment with Light Weight Render Pipeline (Which is another really cool thing).<br/>Just discovered that Unity WebGL handles Audio in a totally different way... Well, I hope you enjoy my awesome visuals.<br/><br/>Project is on Github is you are interested.<br/>https://github.com/alienguard140/Unity_ScriptableObjects_Study1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81d64be139e0cd95debd42932b75818a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Esteban"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
