YOU are the captain of the Traveller, and her fate lies in your hands. Will you be able to discover the way back to Earth from the alien peoples and planets you encounter, or will you and your crew be doomed to roam uncharted space forever?<br/><br/>With Fighting Fantasy's popularity on the rise in the 80s, Steve Jackson was inspired by a different setting from the traditional swords and sorcery - instead looking to science fiction. Starship Traveller allows players to control an entire ship and crew, with each member skilled in certain abilities.<br/><br/>Explore the vast reaches of space, updated for PC, Mac and Linux. Presented in full colour with realistic physics-based dice rolling for battles, auto-mapping, an auto-updated adventure sheet and stat keeping.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:33:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15f3da1b4e52ecad056c1279230911ad.jpg", "website": "http://fightingfantasyapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 90, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tin Man Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tin Man Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
