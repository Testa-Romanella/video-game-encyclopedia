But don't let the short length fool you. You can still enjoy the thrill of dueling using your old books.</p>Introduction\r\n<p>The world of Unfinished: Arena of Books takes place in, you guessed it, books. These Unfinished are incomplete characters, unable to be saved. They were created by an ancient spell called the Book of Words.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The spell was cast by a Great Creator who died without finishing his work. He left behind these incomplete characters, which are now roaming the world of books as The Unfinished.</p>\n<p>They have a sketch-like body with unfinished color and a few basic features. They are not real characters, but instead, a sort of spiritual beings, similar to a ghost. They are not limited to any one type of book or genre.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Unfinished has no set home or territory. Instead, they wander through bookshelves and libraries, searching for others like them. They can be found anywhere books are kept. The Unfinished are constantly searching for someone to help them complete their lives, and they will do anything to get what they want.</p>\r\nSo what is Unfinished?\r\n<p>The book arenas are their playground, where they can battle to prove their worth &amp; fight to save their souls!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The arena is a mysterious space located within our worlds. It\u2019s the home for the Unfinished characters, in the books from which they were taken.</p>\n<p>As with every great story, there is always a villain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are three main villains in the Unfinished: Arena of Books. Their names are unknown, but you may recognize them. One is called The Book Eater.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He appears as a monster or giant, eating whole stacks of books at a time. His reptilian skin has a glossy sheen as if he never changes or ages. He devours books at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>There are also two other villains: The Book of Pages and The Book of Shadows. There are many theories on how exactly these two became villains, but they are known throughout books as the greatest enemies of all. Some say that it\u2019s because they\u2019re jealous that\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Unfinished characters have more fun than they ever did when they were unfinished. Others think the culprits are driven by a desire for revenge or anger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No matter what the cause, they will stop at nothing to find new ways to hurt the Unfinished characters.</p>\n<p>So, for the Arena of Books, the plan is to release 6 sets of character (9 characters) in total.
