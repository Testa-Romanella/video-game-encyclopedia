In many ways; socially, emotionally, expressively, medically, and so on.

This is a first draft of such a game. Yes, it's very hamfisted and janky and more 'tell' than 'show' right now. But I hope it can be of value to someone anyway.</p><p>Made with Gamemaker, uses only a handful of sprites so should run on any PC.
