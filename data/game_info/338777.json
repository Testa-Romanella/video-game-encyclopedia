A story so amazing, you won't believe your eyes!<br/><br/>Now play the game already before I burn it to the ground. Like, seriously. It's like someone learned to make a cool particle effect and made an entire \"game\" out of it. The things I have to do to make this thing qualify as an official game...</p>\n<p>Anyway, I've also left the original, Pac Snowman 1 available for download. If you manage to beat all 100+ levels that I've made, that's just pretty impressive actually!</p>\n<p>Oh, and the controls are just the arrow keys. Good luck, have fun, and burn it to the ground once you've finished with it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014251ce0865c61a1e02b13f468f6254.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J\u0337\u0307\u033ba\u0337\u035d\u0356s\u0337\u033f\u032do\u0336\u0315\u0354n\u0334\u0303\u031e"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
