(see fig 3 and 4)\u00a0 HOWEVER. IT ONLY WORKS INSIDE\u00a0\u00a0THE HUB ROOM.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Take control of Kagliento, the cursed prince of this once great land of Ozeraft.</p>\n<p>You and your fellow heroes were going to the castle in order to kick some treasonous king-killer butt when suddenly, beyond your control, the world started to collapse.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you're stuck in your camp, having to endlessly repeat the same stretch of combat, until you can somehow, possibly, manage to fix this error of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT DOES THIS GAME CONTAIN?</p>\n<p>1. \u00a0Due to Kagliento's curse allowing them to see the ways that\u00a0reality is\u00a0falling apart, this game features a\u00a0variety of mixed media images, cutscenes, and miscellaneous artworks in a variety of forms, like hand-drawn menus, or monochrome pixel cutscenes\u00a0you can admire as your\u00a0reality slowly collapses around your ears.<br/></p>\n<p>2. An interesting form of arcade combat as you spin your magical\u00a0blade constantly around your person, meaning you'll have to manoeuvre your body whilst trying to get your sword to hit an enemy to get that killing blow</p>\n<p>3. Hear an auditory extravaganza as you listen to 8 unique tracks created by yours truly, the developer!</p>\n<p>4. A scintillating method of arena combat, as the only way to \"win\" the game is to kill 100 enemies!</p>\n\n<p>WHAT WILL THIS GAME CONTAIN?</p>\n<p>This is currently Build 1 of the game.</p>\n<p>This means that, instead of giving you the ENTIRE experience at once, the game will update over time, adding on the rest of the game as it's made.</p>\n<p>*THIS IS NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT*</p>\n<p>Here's what you can look forwards to:</p>\n<p>1. Four special skills, activated by Z,X,C,V, (or J,K,L, and ; if you're playing with WSAD)</p>\n<p>*You'll be able to get: Arrows! Boomerangs! Bouncing spells! \u00a0and everybody's\u00a0favourite, Military Grade Explosives!</p>\n\n<p>2. Bosses to analyse, challenge, and eventually CRUSH INTO SHREDS.</p>\n<p>*You will be able to unlock boss fights by beating goals the arena gives you.</p>\n\n<p>3. Non Playable Characters to talk to!</p>\n<p>*NPC's will be shopkeepers, and so you'll get these characters when you get the skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfd8b50cc5a3bb33c6ab762570685ea6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fancy Fairy Co."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
