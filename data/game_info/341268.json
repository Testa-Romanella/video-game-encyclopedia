Now, Sam wants to complete his father's dream of collecting 100 trophies, so he decided to explore those mysterious roads and find that trophy.</p>\n<p>The game contains different types of elements. These elements are used to create different roads.</p>\r\nCobblestone Block\r\n\n<p>This block will let you run your car on itself, but if you touch any of the side faces, then your car will blast and the game will be over.</p>\r\nMoving Platforms\r\n\n<p>These blocks will move right and then left and will continue the cycle. You can touch the side faces of these blocks, but if you stay in contact for more than 5 seconds, your car will explode and the game will be over.</p>\r\nBoosters and Slowers Block\r\n\r\nBoosters\r\n\r\nSlowers\r\n\n<p>These are two different blocks. Boosters will boost up your speed as the name suggest. Slowers will slow you down.</p>\n<p>Like cobblestones, you are not allowed to touch the side faces of the blocks. You can stay in contact with the top face only.</p>\n<p>If you touch /collide with any of the side faces, your game will be over.</p>\r\nLava Block\r\n\n<p>This block look red with light coming out from it, if you try to touch it then you are inviting your end.</p>\n<p>Nothing else can explain you better than this.</p>\r\nSpring Block\r\n\n<p>This block will first boost your speed and then throw you high in the sky. Like any other block, you cannot touch the side faces of this block. If you do so, you will end your life \ud83d\ude1b.</p>\r\nWeak Wooden Block\r\n\n<p>This block is made up of wood and is very weak. If you try to touch it, it will fall down and if you try to land on it you will also fall with this block. The only case when it will not fall is when it is stuck between any other two blocks.</p>\r\nWooden Door\r\n\n<p>This is a door which will block your way to the exit of the road. If you collide with this door, you will end your life. But if you collect key which will open the gate and now it is harmless and you can access the exit of the road.</p>\r\nKey\r\n\n<p>A blue color key which emits light from itself will unlock the door to the exit. It can be found anywhere on the road. To complete the level it is necessary to collect the key so that it will open the wooden door.</p>\r\nTrophy\r\n\n<p>The trophy is the main thing which you are finding in the game. It can be found anywhere on any road.

First five roads are made up of cobblestones only, next five roads are made up of moving platforms. After the 10th road, new elements are introduced at each road.</p>\n<p><strong>New players will often found 1st road too difficult so that they may say that game is a bug in the game. But this is not a case, I have tested all roads by myself and all roads are possible to complete.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The one thing you can do to avoid an explosion is to move in the center. The second thing is the speed of the car, which you have to decide according to your experience.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also, I have mention one thing that, if you have completed 1st road that means now you have learned the mechanics of the game and now you are ready to face more difficulties with experience \ud83d\ude1c.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/170/170421c7b61917baebf16ccf8210c150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lord Hypersonic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
