The theme is Deep Dreams.<br/></p>\n<p>Move Greg's dream spirit around to protect him and keep him snoozin' and cruisin'! Can you make sure Greg gets his full 8 hours of sleep?<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>The bed-car moves on its own, your job is to move around it as Dream Greg (the little white spirit floating around the bed) and collect pillows to keep the sleep meter up.\u00a0 You collect something by touching it with \u00a0Dream Greg. Don't collect energy drinks though, they will decrease your meter!<br/><br/>You can temporarily take control of where the car is going by holding left click, doing this consumes sleep meter though so try to move as least as possible. Use this to avoid obstacles.<br/></p>\n<p>Hold right click to create a forcefield around dream Greg, you can block dangerous objects like energy drinks with it if they are in your path.<br/><br/>When your sleep meter reaches 0% you wake up and the game ends, try to sleep as long as possible!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/278f459dd746f90c34819108aabbd37e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shano19", "basilicon", "WilfredTheBoss", "Hyeve"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
