The initial square has an HP of 20<br/>2. After (100/HP) seconds, a child is created if the square is still \"alive\"<br/>3. The AREA of the square represents its HP<br/>4. A child will have the health stat created according to \" HP = (\"parent's HP\") x (random number between (1-volatility) and (1+volatility)) \"<br/>5. The HP is reduced by the \"damage\" stat x 60 per second<br/>6. When HP is reduced to 0, the square \"dies\"<br/>7. A child will be placed within its parent's length and its (length x 2.5)<br/>8. If two squares overlap THE LARGER ONE SURVIVES (no damage is dealt to it either from this interaction)</p>\n<p><strong><br/><em>Tips:</em></strong><br/>Manage the number of squares on screen by varying the damage<br/>Do not overuse the time speed feature, risk vs reward<br/><strong>There is not way of \"winning\" the game, only losing.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a19eb7d21bf8899e504bd9688bbbd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mumblejum"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
