Play as Astra, a repeater whose teammates' real bodies were killed in an accident. She's stranded on a planet full of hostile aliens, her only ally the feisty robot B.U.D. Help her beat the odds and return to civilization--or perish in a downward spiral of insanity.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Death is part of the story.
