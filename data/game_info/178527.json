Get hurt to make the damage percentage go up -- but be warned that higher damage means you take more and more knockback from being hit by enemy shots! Knock a player out of bounds and you steal their damage percentage, adding it to your own total. Get knocked out of bounds and go back to zero. At the end of 3 minutes, the person with the highest damage percentage wins.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Ludum Dare 40, with the theme \"The more you have, the worse it is.\"</p>\n<p>I didn't get the chance to put much work into this game as I would have liked; my dad had to be rushed into the emergency room overnight on day 1 of the dare (he's fine now). I effectively lost about 2 days' worth of the 72 hours that was allotted for the Ludum Dare, time that I wanted to spend working on this. That means that the art and UI needs work -- but the core game loop itself is there, and I have fun playing it! I hope you guys do, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28245bab8c183c5154c13400af567d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jay2645"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
