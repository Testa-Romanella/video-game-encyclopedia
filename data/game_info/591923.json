Only you can save the game from crashing by fixing the bugs. If the code stability goes below 35% then you have just 30 secs to bring it back to normal, else it's GAME OVER.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme - Crappy Developers</strong></p>\n<p>The game follows the theme where the game is built by some crappy developers. There are too many bugs in the game and you play as the \"Bug Fixer\" who needs to fix the bugs to save the game from crashing. The crappy developers have also mixed a 2D top-down game with a platformer physics-based game. You still need to play the game and maintain the code stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>\"Bug Fixer\" is a partial top-down 2D game and partial platformer physics-based game where the main goal is to maintain the code stability of the game by fixing the bugs. And fixing the bugs is very simple, just push them into the \"green\" auto bug-fixer portal that appears in the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The controls are super simple.</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</li><li>Enter or Space to start</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Concept, Design &amp; Programming<ul><li>Anagh's World - using <strong>Godot 3.2.3</strong></li></ul></li><li>Graphics<ul><li>Auto Bug-Fixer Portal - Anagh's World</li></ul><ul><li>Player Character - Anagh's World &amp; pipoya @ itch.io</li></ul><ul><li>Bugs - didier-capdevielle @ itch.io</li></ul><ul><li>Tileset - Kenney (www.kenney.nl) &amp; spiral atlas @ opengameart.org</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Anagh's World, Kenney (www.kenney.nl) &amp; CodeManu @ opengameart.org</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/263/263f222f57427ed3eb267c0dfc9c7c80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anagh's World"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
