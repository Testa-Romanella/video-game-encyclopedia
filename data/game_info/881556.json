A 20 second game was so small that I figured there was no reason <em>not </em>to make one. Shame I only found out about the jam very late, so I settled on the quickest game idea I had. Have fun!</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>The floor is the timer<br/></strong> Some numbers are easier to walk on than others - you may actually need to pay attention.</li><li><strong>No hassle</strong>\n<br/>\r\nPlay the entire game in-browser. No reason not to try it out ;)\r\n</li><li><strong>Teeny\u00a0<br/></strong>The game is literally 20 seconds long. Seriously.</li><li><strong>Easy<br/></strong>A slight challenge at best - this game was meant to be a quick win, not a rage-inducer.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was thrown together by\u00a0<strong>Asith\u00a0</strong><em>(@AsithDevs\u00a0on Twitter).</em>\u00a0Stick around for more random stuff. I have no idea what I could make next!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T11:03:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/4032b2d317fdefdbce975098b5b8b43c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asith"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
