To escape, you must collect the four Soul Shards which are found in various chests throughout the dungeon. Once all four are collected, you will notice that the boss door, located in the room with the four altars, has now opened. Throughout this adventure, make sure to watch your torch because as time goes on, it will slowly deplete. \u00a0Coal, which can be found in chests and by killing enemies, is used to refuel your torch. The torch must also be placed on the ground before equipping a new weapon and walking outside of it's light causes you to take damage.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T18:16:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738ce81bff6f1d241229c5bb091d5289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Havox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
