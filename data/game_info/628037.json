I hope to add alot more to this as time goes on. Tho this is rough I will keep working to flush out many things and add things such as FPS/TPS elements on top of the rpg base that has been started.<br/>There is alot to do and I hope you all will enjoy the journey as I attempt to start development of a game of mine.<br/><br/>To close the info menu please click the red mark on the top left.<br/><br/>I will do what I can with what I have. If anything happens such as progress stalled/stopped. Then my PC bit the bullet as it is fairly old and have been having problems, and will have to hope I have saved everything correctly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d392335a21cc25bd247f40056ae8495.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AzaGorod"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
