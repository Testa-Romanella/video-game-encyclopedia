You must feed The Abomination anything you can find to keep it alive!</p>\n<p>Your weird uncle REALLY has to go to the bathroom, and look... you are right there! He frantically tells you about his \"abomination\" that he has been growing in his basement. He tells you that it moves and must be fed. He seemed very sure that you cannot possibly keep it alive with just the items around the basement, and that items must be combined! He ran off to the bathroom before you could ask what combinations worked, so good luck keeping it alive!</p>\n<p>I am 16 years old and this was my first game jam experience. To be honest, it was really stressful, but also loads of fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da1/da116f5724cde742f724e09c989b12f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vano_oh_mano"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
