This is a portfolio project that I made for a class during the summer term around June and July, time span of 8 weeks, and total hours spent on this project is roughly 90 hours. This is developed inside my own engine that has been created in the past school year. I did the Art and Audio as well, using Aseprite and 1BITDRAGON, the art creation time also count towards the project time, while audio is done after the project due date. Due to my lack of skill in art and sound, those part of the game are less complete.<h3>Future Plan</h3>This is the first self guided project for the school and there is still two more to come. So my time to work on this is very limited, perhaps I will only find time to polish this after I graduate which is 1 year after the release date. <br/>At this point, the audio is not done yet, and I still haven't done any vampire-survivor mechanics like the select 1 from 3 upgrade, mini boss, and chess. I will definitely try to get these in before other things.<h3>Gameplay Features</h3><ul><li> Auto-chess shop<br/></li><li> Auto-chess bench<br/></li><li> Auto-chess match 3 upgrade system<br/></li><li> Auto-chess unit trait bond system<br/></li><li> 2D infinite grid map<br/></li><li> Vampire-survivor enemy spawning and targeting</li></ul><h3>Technical Features</h3><ul><li> 2D disc physics<br/></li><li> Binary data save/load<br/></li><li> Game specific UI framework<br/></li><li> XML data save/load<br/></li><li> Data-driven architecture<br/></li><li> Tutorial<br/></li><li> Leaderboard</li></ul><h3>Engine Features</h3><ul><li> 2D / 3D rendering with DirectX<br/></li><li> Audio rendering with FMOD<br/></li><li> Event System<br/></li><li> DevConsole<br/></li><li> XML loading with tinyXML2<br/></li><li> Image loading with stb_img<br/></li><li> Perlin/Fractal noise with squirrelnoise4<br/></li><li> Multi-threading<br/></li><li> 2D Heat Map<br/></li><li> Xbox support with xinput<br/></li><li> 2D / 3D Simple Geometry Physics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T02:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26a2fe6ea1f03977341b16d4cd13329e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yiming Pan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Yiming Pan"], "esrb_rating": null}
