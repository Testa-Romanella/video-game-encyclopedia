I'll be changing the main video to something more consolidated.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>*This project was designed for gamepads but will also work for mouse and keyboard however certain \"button held down\" attacks will be limited to gamepad only. (greatsword held attacks and bow held attacks)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Environments in the videos &amp; trailers will not be included\u00a0(for now)\u00a0for the sake of keeping the build project file as small as possible!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Play from the \"Chapter select\" menu otherwise you'll end up just getting dumped into a third person template map</strong></p><p><strong>*Bosses were designed for LanFang, the chapter 1 character. Fighting them with any other character may bring unwanted results.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>*LanFang and\u00a0GhostSamurai will start out in swimsuits. You can go to the crafting menu to create and</strong><strong> put some gear on or\u00a0kill enemies to loot the gear instead. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>*There will be some text on screen to prevent\u00a0false ownership and reselling, not that my game is even good enough for that sort of attention but still.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Warning: Currently extremely buggy, to fully enjoy the game at its current state, reading the character tutorials is recommended as well as keeping clear from button mashing as doing so may result in undesired effects.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*Items can be crafted but beware of which items you equip. Certain items are only meant for a specific character and if equipped to an incorrect character will yield\u00a0unwanted results. There are currently no restrictions or tags to identify which item is for who, so craft and equip at your own risk!\u00a0<strong>Heavy/Light/Cloth sets are for LanFang while\u00a0G2 Cyborg sets and last few cores on the crafting list are for GhostSamurai.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>*This game was created and runs on my RTX 2070S. I haven't tested it on another PC or have had anyone test it on a lower end PC yet.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>PROJECT_REMNANT is an Unreal Engine blueprint-based hack n slash\u00a0project currently being developed\u00a0by\u00a0TakiGames.</p>\n<p>The playable build of PROJECT_REMNANT will continuously be changed and updated.</p>\n<p>PROJECT_REMNANT is a hack n slash action game featuring a multitude of different characters and movesets. The gameplay mechanics center around a variety of stances and modes of combat per character with specific abilities that connect the different styles together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the moment, the demo builds will feature a menu screen where the player can choose which chapter to play. Each chapter contains a different character that is contained within a small map accompanied by enemies who will infinitely spawn and come after the player. Each chapter will have a tutorial for the character as well as a resting spot to get away from enemies and a white box that will end the current chapter and unlock a new one. Enemies will drop loot when killed which can only be collected when the character is unsheathed. However only 2 out of the 5 characters will have access to equipping the loot.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Demo Gameplay\u00a0Playthrough</p>\n\n<p>Characters &amp; Gameplay</p>\n<p>LanFang</p>\n\n<p>GhostSamurai</p>\n\n\n<p>Blader</p>\n<p>Dragongirl</p>\n\n<p>Yui\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>left click attack\u00a0 \u00a0(gamepad left face button)</p>\n<p>right click charge attack\u00a0 (gamepad right face button)</p>\n<p>left ctrl dodge\u00a0 (gamepad right face button)</p>\n<p>tab change stance\u00a0 (gamepad left shoulder)</p>\n<p>left shift special 1\u00a0 (gamepad right shoulder)</p>\n<p>Q equip unequip\u00a0 \u00a0 (gamepad right trigger)</p>\n<p>E special 2\u00a0 \u00a0 (gamepad d pad down)</p>\n<p>E to loot</p>\n<p>T special 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(gamepad d pad up )</p>\n<p>gamepad d pad down to climb</p>\n<p>LANFANGswordeq 1 (gamepad left trigger)</p>\n<p>LANFANGLaunch z\u00a0 (gamepad left stick button)</p>\n<p>i for inventory (gamepad special right)</p>\n<p>fps</p>\n<p>shift run (gamepad left stick button)</p>\n<p>c crouch ( gamepad face button right)</p>\n<p>space jump (gamepad face button bottom)</p>\n<p>x relax (gamepad special right)</p>\n<p>rmb ads (gamepad right trigger)</p>\n<p>middle mouse grenade (gamepad right shoulder)</p>\n<p>r reload (gamepad left face button)</p>\n<p>tab cycle weapon (gamepad face button top)</p>\n\n<p>If you want, you can support me on Kofi</p>\n<p>Buy TakiGames a Coffee. ko-fi.com/takigames - Ko-fi \u2764\ufe0f Where creators get support from fans through donations, memberships, shop sales and more!
