Weapons</em></strong>\r\n\u00a0In the world of Tower of Arcana, the weapon is a spellbook. There are many kinds of spells.\r\nEach spell has its own passive (this is not yet implemented as part of the plan).\r\nEach spell (weapon) has four deck slots. The first slot is fixed to 'Attack' slot as shown below.\r\nThe remaining 2, 3, and 4 slots are randomly determined for every weapon. A description of this deck slot will be explained in detail later.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;The first slot of the weapon is fixed as 'Attack'&gt;</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>2. Deck slots and deck presets</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;5 card types, all cards have a card type!&gt;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1) Attack: Consists of spell cards that inflicts great damage to the enemy\r\n2) Defense: consists of cards to protect the player from the enemy\r\n3) Buff: Consists of cards that strengthen the player's abilities\r\n4) Debuff: Consists of cards that lower the enemy's stats\r\n5) Utilities: consist of cards that are useful in certain situations</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, the weapon has four deck slots.\r\nEach slot has a 'deck preset' type that can be used in the slot.\r\nIf a slot gets a spell (weapon) with 'attack', 'attack', 'defense', or 'buff', the player will have three types of attack and defense buffs\r\nWill be available. A deck preset is what the player must configure to use the card and is associated with the deck slot of the weapon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&lt;<strong>Left Window : Deck Preset, Right Window : Card Inventory&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>How to configure the deck presets depends on the player's card inventory\r\nSimply double-click or drag the card you want to use to register it in your deck preset.\r\nYou can see the deck slots (attack, attack, defense, buff) currently applied to the weapon in the slot type part of the picture above.\r\nYou can see four deck presets in I, II, III, and IV by looking at the deck presets in the left pane of the photo.\r\nUp to four deck presets can be configured for each of the five card types (attack, defense, buff, debuff, and utilities).\r\nIn the above picture, I and II are lit red because the weapon has activated the attacking slots I and II.\r\nEven if you register a card in a deck preset (gray III or IV) that is not activated by a weapon, you can not use the card in a real battle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<strong>&lt;Screen where the deck preset is configured (you can double-click or drag the card in the card inventory to register it in the deck preset)&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>All deck presets are cost. At this time, cost is calculated by summing the cost of cards registered in the slot.</p>\n<p><strong><em>3. Card</em></strong>\r\n\u00a0As mentioned earlier, in the Tower of Arkanas, cards are like other game skills.\r\nThere are ways to acquire cards, such as monster treatment, acquisition through a treasure room, or purchase at a card shop.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Purchase card at card shop!&gt;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>&lt;- Woo Hyo ~, get \u2606 ~ Super Lucky \u2661 da - !!&gt;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you buy a card at a card shop, you might be worried about parts like Gacha.\r\nDo not worry. Instead of drawing money by using real money, you buy through the goods in the game.\r\nThe only purchasing factor in cash currently being planned is the purchase of the game.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&lt;Color appearance of card by property&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>The card also has the attributes fire / water / tree / person / cancer (attributes can be added during later development).\r\nEach attribute has a mutual relationship and can be attacked with more basic damage and damage attributes.\r\nEach property also has its own special effect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0If you use a card in battle, you will have a card shuffle. This shuffle is based on the player's deck presets.\r\nTherefore, you have to play while paying attention to the card counting in your hand, and you can continue the battle with the card of the combination you conceive.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Level(Map)</strong></em>\r\n\u00a0Current map (shelter, treasure, monster, shop,?, Boss) is implemented state.\r\nThe map is constantly being developed and updated, and we are planning various kinds of maps.\r\nThe shelter serves as the base for the player, and the treasure room gives the player a chance to gain valuable cards or items.\r\nIn the Monster map, you can get items through battle with monsters, but you can lose your life.\r\nThe shop map is for purchasing items using the goods obtained through the battle. ? Is an option that does not know what to expect.\r\nThe boss map is at the very end of the map and must be defeated to move on to the next stage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>&lt;Level movement is done through node selection!&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>5. Overload</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Filled overload gauge!\u00a0 (Mouse Pointer)&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>If you defeat the enemy, the magic essence will scatter and float. You can obtain an integer to fill the overload gauge.\r\nUsing a tightly loaded overload gauge will allow your card to be used without cooldown.\r\nIf you take advantage of this, you will be able to play a more pleasant and powerful battle!</p>\n</strong>\n<p><strong>6.How to Play</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) When you start the game, you will start in the same shelter as the photo above.<br/>2) Then, go to the right(You can see the flying table. That is Temp card shop).</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0Go to the card shop and press the 'I' button to open the card shop. Then double click 'Test Card Pack' on the left.<br/></p>\n\n<p>4)\u00a0When you come up, there is an 'Item shop'. Currently, items are only weapons, not weapons.\u00a0Since each slot is randomly assigned to a weapon, try purchasing a weapon until the desired card slot is available.</p>\n<p>5) You can equip your weapon by pressing the number keys 1 and 2.<br/></p>\n<p>6)\u00a0You can configure the deck by closing the UI window and pressing the numeric keys 3 and 4.\u00a0Make your deck here.</p>\n\n<p>7)Go back to the portal above and press 'F' to move to another dungeon.<br/></p>\n<p>*Tip</p>\n<p>1)\u00a0Numeric keys 8, 9, 0 move you directly to the boss.</p>\n<p>2) The number 3 immediately fills your Overload gauge.</p>\n<p>3) Press ESC key and Select Third Button then you can Exit Game.<br/></p>\n<p>4)Keys : Q,W,E,R = Use Card from your hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0T = Use Over guage function when guage full.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Z = Item pick up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Space = Teleport.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Insert and Home = Skill Indicator Off/On</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:49:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1efceac70e1f8903aac69f5a51be6b04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PentaBit"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
