The biggest \n      appeal of this game comes from discovering all the ways you can attack \n      your enemies. Your weaponry includes three main blast weapons upgradable \n      by collecting more items, a charged attack you can use when Iron Clad is \n      attached to your ship, three types of melee weapons you can brandish to \n      show off your strength in close-range combat, a bomber that clears all \n      enemy bullets, and finally shooting patterns that change based on \n      whether the Iron Clad is attached or disconnected from your ship. And \n      not surprisingly, a vast array of weaponry lies in wait to be part of \n      your arsenal. You can even select the stages you want, feeding your \n      hunger for combat and allowing you to see different endings for each \n      play through! You can have a blast playing over and over again to see \n      all the endings and variety this game has to offer.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
