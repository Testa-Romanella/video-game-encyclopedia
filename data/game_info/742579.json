Grab your roommate, partner, sibling, etc, because this is a 2 player game! There is an AI opponent, but it is very basic (and may be a little buggy).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:\u00a0Left-click to select, right-click to cancel</p>\n<p><strong>Rules:\u00a0</strong>On the first turn, each player places 4 units on their side of the board\u00a0(you can pick as many of each type as you like). Every turn after that, each player gets 3 actions (move or attack) per turn. The game is over when one player runs out of units.</p>\n<p><strong>Units:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Bison\u00a0</strong>(well-rounded)<ul><li>3 HP, 2 ATK</li><li>Move in any direction (2 squares)</li><li>Attack diagonally (1 square)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mammoth\u00a0</strong>(tank)<ul><li>5 HP, 1 ATK</li><li>Move up/down, left/right (1 square)</li><li>Attack in any direction (1 square)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Warrior\u00a0</strong>(ranged)<ul><li>1 HP, 3 ATK</li><li>Move diagonally (1 square)</li><li>Attack left/right (3 squares)</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music Credit: </strong>Rain by Stellarmusic\u00a0https://www.jamendo.com/track/1143621/rain</p><p><strong>Known Issues:\u00a0</strong>It is possible to \"box in\" a player's units by blocking all of their movement options. If all of a (non-cpu) player's units are blocked from moving, and cannot attack, then the game is stuck and must be reset<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T07:49:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/486/4869eea1c73ec69d2eb0e6dda53813ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chazzzz"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
