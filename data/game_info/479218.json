{"id": 479218, "slug": "kaset", "name": "Kaset", "name_original": "Kaset", "description": "<p><strong>:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Kaset is an Arcade Space Shooter inspired by 80's arcade graphics and the\u00a0synthwave music genre. This game was made for the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam. The theme was Rewind.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys -OR- WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Mouse to Aim.</p>\n<p>Click to Shoot.</p>\n<p>Spacebar to Rewind!!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0You control a set of old cassette tapes, playing through the music they contain, while fighting neon, three dimensional shapes. As a cassette you are tethered to a long stretch of tape. While this tape can restrict your movement, you also have the powerful ability to rewind the tape, gaining back some tape for movement while also destroying enemies in your way. Geometric enemies will spawn on the outskirts of the screen in tune with the music to challenge you. Luckily each cassette comes equipped with a unique weapon perfect for the job.\u00a0The goal is to acquire as many points as possible in the given levels by chaining kill combos and finishing with as much health left as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>I created the entirety of Kaset excluding what is included in the Attributions below.
