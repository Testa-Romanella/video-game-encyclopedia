It consists of a PBR rendered scene with dynamic and static collisions, euclidean physics and multiple camera angles.</p>\n<p>Having never had experience with graphics programming before this project, this was an introduction to shader programming and the graphics pipeline. It also served to improve my knowledge of physical interactions in games.\r\n    </p>\n<p>This project consists of a space scene with phong shading. A skybox is present and a scorpion-like spaceship is free to move around the scene, displace dynamic colliders (asteroids) and static colliders (lamp posts). The player can swap camera angles and enable/disable debug information. All controls are listed in the program's command prompt. Sphere colliders were used for ease of collision detection and the ASSIMP library has been implemented for importing of custom models.\r\n </p>\n<p>Build files to try out the simulation are available on this page, source files are available on github at the following link: https://github.com/GameDevChris/OpenGL-Physics-Simulation<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T09:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04a/04aae833a6dc3b67f3b6cd3359951d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bodsworthcm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
