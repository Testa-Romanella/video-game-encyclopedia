The theme for this week's game was \"Tactile\" so I had to make something that communicated touch. <br/></p>\n<p>For me paper is one of the most recognizable feelings so I made a simple game where you stamp sheets of paper, that's it. Play the game at your own pace, fast or slow. This game is for people that want a simple experience where challenging yourself is optional.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/962/96252ce7b752d30fc9e1c6b23e1f1bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Seiruzan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
