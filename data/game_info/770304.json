And not even in the way we expected. It was something from underground, you think. Or maybe it was the ocean? Whatever, you didn\u2019t pay much attention in school, but it\u2019s called the Blight and we survived it. They say if we keep it up we\u2019ll have most of the planet back in 20 years. Sure, but for now, you hate your job, and you would say it hated you back if it even seemed to know that you\u2019re alive. Still, it gets you out of the house, and this next assignment seems pretty alright. A day and a half\u2019s hike into the Restoration Zone, some cleanup work, and then you come home with a bigger paycheck than usual. What could go wrong?</p>\n<p>GHOST MOTH is a science fiction horror text game made in Twine by Rhiannon Naomi Daly, about parasitism, gig work, revenge, and the economics of sacrificing what makes you human to remain alive just a little longer.\r\n</p>\n<p>content warnings for body horror, parasitism, fungi, insect imagery, mind control/possession, discussion of suicide, implied transphobia, and mention of drugs\r\n</p>\n<p>This is an updated version of the game I made for Ludum Dare 50, with features added that were written or planned at the time of the game jam deadline, but not yet implemented. I will continue to update this page as I add more features to the project (more art, soundtrack, etc). I also plan on continuing the story in a subsequent project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T11:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36a6ceb4d490a2c51d9517ebe35cd659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rhiannon N.
