{"id": 807620, "slug": "persist", "name": "Persist", "name_original": "Persist", "description": "<p>Persist is a third-person hack-and-slash rouge-like game. Taking place in an ever-shifting dungeon sprawling with constructs from a forgotten age, you must fight your way through the rooms and battle the floor's keeper to venture further. Progress through randomly-generated floors gathering powerful items, unique weapons and devastating spells to prepare yourself to battle the ever-growing threat. Choose your playstyle by leveling up and selecting items to create divergent builds. Be a fighter, spell-slinger or tank, the choice is yours. Venture solo or gather allies and challenge the dungeon in online co-operative multiplayer. A dark and foreboding atmosphere looms over the dungeon, with mystery surrounding every corner.
