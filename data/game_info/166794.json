The only information you are given is the dice you have in your hand and the number of total dice.</p>\n<p>Important caveat!\u00a0Ones are wildcards. This means they represent all possible face values simultaneously.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, each player rolls 5 dice and does not reveal the resulting rolls to the others. For the first round, the player who goes first is assigned randomly.</p>\n<p>On your turn you have two options, doing one of them will pass the turn to the next person:</p>\n<ul><li>Raise:\u00a0(Sometimes referred to as \"betting\") You can assert a new face/ value pair. So long as\u00a0<em>n</em>\u00a0is higher than the previous bet OR\u00a0<em>n</em>\u00a0is equal to the original bet but\u00a0<em>d</em>\u00a0is greater than the original.</li><li>Call:\u00a0You assert that the current bet is too high. This will end the round and reveal everyone's dice.</li></ul>\n<p>When someone calls, the round ends and all dice are revealed. The final raise is compared to the total number of dice\u00a0<em>d</em>\u00a0on the board (plus all the ones!).</p>\n<p>If the count (<em>n</em>) is equal to or greater than what was asserted in the raise, the raiser wins. Otherwise, the caller wins. Winner goes first next round, and loser loses a di. When a di is lost, it is eliminated from play, giving that player that much less information to work with in subsequent rounds.</p>\n<p>When a player runs out of dice, they are out of the game, the last player remaining wins.</p>\n\n<p>To run this game you will need to install LOVE2D: https://love2d.org</p>\n\n<p>Here's the current build (as of 11/9/2017)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b09c78279139de3e2de30965d4745d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Potatoes Are Not Explosive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
