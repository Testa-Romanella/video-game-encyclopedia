The first room is for ordinary melee enemies, and the second room is for slow-moving turrets. Because I personally want to increase the skill type, the turret can attack from a long distance, but here the long-range attack is a straight line shooting, the player can choose to avoid the bullet, or find a place to avoid it, and in this room, I added multiple doors to block the player's Vision, unable to detect enemies in time. The third room is the main Boss, and a character model of myself, enlarged to increase the picture quality, the boss in the third room will always keep looking at the player, no matter how the player moves, it will look at the player, and this Boss is also a launcher Bullets, but compared to the second room, the bullets in the boss room will automatically track the player. The player mainly shoots the boss's bullets, and the bullets disappear when the health value of the boss's bullets is exhausted. No matter where the players run here, they cannot avoid them. Boss bullets, so keep focusing on shooting, and the most important thing is to find the location of the Boss, then you can shoot the Boss, and the game wins after you shoot the Boss. Game Three rooms have been added to this game, and the ability of the players will fight to survive until the end, so there are no multiple checkpoints. If the player dies, the game restarts until the player is able to find the secret to the game. After shooting the boss, you will go to the second scene, which is the so-called second level. However, due to personal ability and time issues, we cannot create a more difficult game for everyone to experience. I am very sorry!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T10:58:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc2f4adf2e97184c003d7c1158e7633a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eidio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
