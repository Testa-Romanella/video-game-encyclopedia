Snowball is a game about a small snowball stuck in a wind storm trying to get home before he is blow away by the\u00a0wind, oh did I mention the spikes? Yea you might want to watch out for those... In Snowball the player only has two buttons, they can move left and jump, but what about right you might ask? The only way to move right is to ride the wind and let the storm carry you. The snowball's fate is in your hands will you learn to\u00a0conquer the storm or will the storm\u00a0conquer you?</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Wall Climbing/Jumping</p>\n<p>Start Menu with\u00a0functional buttons and sound</p>\n<p>Pause Menu that pauses and ALSO has\u00a0functional buttons</p>\n<p>Wind Noise and Music</p>\n<p>Two Button Player</p>\n<p>DEADLY Spikes</p>\n<p>Raging Wind</p>\n<p>Made out of 2D art assets</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move Left \"A\"</p>\n<p>Jump \"W\"</p>\n<p>Pause \"ESC\"</p>\n<p>Note: if you die by the spikes pause the game and select \"Menu\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/10107dba2e008d9bf6a22ece0c7da4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AidanDavis91"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
