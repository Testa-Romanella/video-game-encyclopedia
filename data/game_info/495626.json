Hand drawn animations over the film serve to provide a more tactile experience of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-20T13:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62d9d045052d2cc6bd4b6e3a61024879.jpg", "website": "https://www.fmvworld.com/afterhours.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
