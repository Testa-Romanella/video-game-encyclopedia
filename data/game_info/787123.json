Assist your white knight AI in defending your firewall against the viruses spread by the black knight! Can you defeat this the black knight pestilence and defend your kingdom?!</p>\n<p>Server Knights was created in 2 weeks as submission to Roguelike Jam 2, who's theme was web. We interpreted web to mean a digital web, one built of circuits, code, viruses, and AI. The theme not only inspired us visually, but mechanically as well:\u00a0take note of the web tower, which bridges (webs) to other nearby web towers. The web towers can then both provide a mix of bonuses to the web which are then applied to enemies who path through them.</p>\n<p>Click + Drag to play cards!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits to:</p>\n<p>Ben Vivas - Art<br/>Wyatt Schafer - Art<br/>Yeri Hwang - Art<br/>Avea Krause - Development<br/>Vanna Chrislinge - Development</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T14:48:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f38c361176fdbce64670fdeb09853c84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spherous"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
