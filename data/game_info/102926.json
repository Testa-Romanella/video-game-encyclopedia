They will purchase fighting units, plan a strategy, capture territory, and engage enemy units in combat. Players can choose their path to victory, either by controlling the most territory, by annihilating the enemy units, or a combination of the two. Strategy, placement of units, and knowing when to balance combat with land-grabbing will decide the fate of these two opposing armies.</p>\n<p>Victorum was developed in a collaborative effort between students from The Cleveland Institute of Art (CIA) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/1616ae742eae268036bd39a0517dfe35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CWRU-EECS390"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
