It\u2019s a game where the character is stuck in a routine. Every day is worse than the precedent. His only way to get out is to call Mary, but he can\u2019t do it. Maybe if he keeps trying ?</p>\n<p>Honestly, the game is far from being finish. But we think that he has great potential and that we can do a lot more after the jam.</p>\n<p>Controls and explanations : Arrows to move, A and E keys for interactions. Every loop you have to do tasks. One of them is \u201cCall Mary\u201d. You have to try five time to call Mary to unlock the end. After a few loops, the character is so depressed that he want to kill himself with everything he can find.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d1f73d7ab809d7298ecaeef8350373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jammin'!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
