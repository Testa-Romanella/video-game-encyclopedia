After years of on-off development, team Elysium made a breakthrough in 2022 by finally addressing all of the remaining bugs of the C64 edition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not only was the game complete for the stock breadbin, in addition, this version also utilises the Commodore 128 (in C64 mode), the game uses the 2MHz mode of the processor (off-screen), which provides a 30% increase in-game speed. Not only that, a special speed-up version of the game was also crafted: Amaurote for the SCPU, Turbo Chameleon and Ultimate64 accelerators - all in 20mhz mode. Just make sure you answer \u201cyes\u201d in the trainer menu. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Enhancing the game presentation even further, <strong>Micha\u0142 Hoffmann</strong> (<em>Randall/Elysium/MSL</em>) was employed to deliver a new C64 soundtrack, reminiscent of the original, utilising the power of the SID. Additionally, <strong>James Sv\u00e4rd</strong> (<em>Joe/Wrath Designs</em>) crafted a beautiful title picture to complete the game's 2022 rendition. As a cherry on top\u00a0<strong>Cal Skuthorpe</strong> (<em>Buzz Clik/Onslaught</em>) created a superb dir-art.</p>\n<p>This game is free to download and play.
