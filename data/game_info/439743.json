This is a top-down shoot-em-up, as part of an assignment to focus on an arcade mechanic and see how well we could replicate it ourselves from scratch! I'd also like to thank the star-generation function from the MBoffin Pico-8 instructional zine. I enjoyed creating this because I\u00a0was really able to play around with graphical generation and hitboxes in Pico-8!</p>\n<p><em>This game was created as part of the Tiny Games class at the ATLAS Institute at The University\u00a0of Colorado Boulder</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f22fcd6ed5b7d398c21ea430b920fe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harrison Bolin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
