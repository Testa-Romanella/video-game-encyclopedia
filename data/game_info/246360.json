{"id": 246360, "slug": "prototype-shooter", "name": "Prototype Shooter", "name_original": "Prototype Shooter", "description": "<p>This is a procedural endless shooter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently in the prototype phase, but will be developed over time. \u00a0Basic gameplay is in place and you can continue to build a high score until you die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turrets, guards, and passing maps currently generate score. <br/></p>\n<p>Not all turrets are active. This is randomly controlled, but if they are active you can shoot them and eventually destroy them. This is indicated by the smoke that pours out of them.</p>\n<p>You can go up the large black tower, just walk up to the ladder. </p>\n<p>There are many known issues/bugs that are on the list to be addressed:</p>\n<ul><li>Stutter at game start and mid-level. This may vary in severity and is related to map spawning. Depending on your machine it can range from completely unnoticeable, to causing a 1 second freeze. This is also not consistent as some maps randomly spawn easier than others. </li><li>AI - AI functions on a basic level. They will explore, shoot the player, they are capable of crossing bridges and ascending one of the towers</li><li>Guns currently don't have an independent collision mesh and can poke though things</li><li>Various sounds are missing, bullet impact, turret rotation sounds and others are intended to be implemented</li><li>The AI will occasionally spawn in an odd place, or get hung up on some terrain features</li><li>Some collision meshes are not that great. This is a side-effect of a prototype project built using free-assets. The large tree house that sometimes spawns can be ascended by the player, you just need to do a little jumping in a couple spots to clear the collisions. This will either be fixed or replaced later. </li></ul>\n<p>If you do spot any bugs or issues not listed on here, feel free to leave feedback in the form of comments. This project is under constant development, so issues will be looked at going forward. <br/></p>\n<p>File size will be looked at, but this is mostly connected with the assets used in game. At a future date most assets will be replaced with more functional and optimized ones.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - shooting (currently no aim)</p>\n<p>Left-Ctrl - Crouch</p>\n<p>F - activate doors</p>\n<p>Escape - in-game pause menu</p><p>T- Screenshots with no UI<br/></p>\n<p>Music - Andre Jetson<br/>Some Sound Effects - MrCisum<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/484111d3a705cea365d2d84d88134781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DolosGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
