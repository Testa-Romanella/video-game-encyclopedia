Hack robots on the board (space ship rooms) and collect enough data to perform the Cyber Attack, but be cautious because the main computer (M.A.Z.E.) can hack you back and you will need to grab the gun to protect yourself. Robots that can explode and 3D puzzles will create tight situations, so be ready for it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T05:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8a73ec57a3bad1a8380717d13cc1812.jpg", "website": "https://cyberattack-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LUXO Interactive", "HOTOREL"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LUK KUS SOFT", "HOTOREL"], "esrb_rating": null}
