Press further along wielding your bow, your trusty sword, and whatever throwable potions you can get your grubby hands on. With no time to heal, most damage will be fatal.</p>Background\r\n<p>RUN was built over 7 days with very little previous code. I started with the idea of making a roguelike with combat that happens simultaneously while still retaining some of the slow decision making of traditional grid based roguelikes. This ended up feeling a lot like Superhot. I had doubts I\u00a0would be able to get the enemy pathing to work nicely in a windy generated dungeon in the time I\u00a0had\u00a0so I chose to instead push the player forward with a moving wall of fire. If I spend more time with it, I would like to at least generate some terrain to make the progression across more dynamic and less of a gauntlet.</p>\n<p>In terms of procedural content, there's not much. I've used perlin noise to generate the floor tiles and basic spawning tables to change the types of enemies that spawn on the different floors. Enemies spawn along the whole of the floor in group sizes\u00a0corresponding to the floor.</p>\n<p>I initially planned to implement a variety of weapons that could be picked up and have different properties but didn't find the time for it. I wanted to implement potions and wands with random colors that have to be discovered each run. While I had time to implement a few potion types, I\u00a0didn't get to the wands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given what little code I had going in, I'm pretty happy with the result. I\u00a0think next time I'd benefit greatly if I\u00a0came prepared with some constructs in advance. I was figuring a lot out as I\u00a0went and it took a lot of time away from going deeper.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Hold Z to aim</p>\n<p>Press X while aiming to use weapon</p>\n<p>Hold X to choose weapon (selected on release)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:33:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/3902a5b52badfa575b16fb02dd2c052d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wavefold"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
