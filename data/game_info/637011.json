See how long you can survive for. \r\n</p>\n<p>I'm  fairly happy with how it turned out for my first Game Jam, and it  was a  good learning experience. I wanted to add a lot more features,  such as  weapon upgrades, other power ups, more enemies, score.. etc. However, I  focused on aiming to have the game in a complete playable state.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/206/206dccc054ad689c160401fbeea8f34a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmallOcelot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
