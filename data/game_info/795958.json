Each wave ends with a pivotal choice: which of your key abilities do you want to upgrade, and which one do you want to give up? Healing, shooting, slashing, running, and dashing are all integral to besting the monsters and traps that stand in your way, so choosing wisely is essential. Though they are difficult, each choice you make is not blind, as you\u2019ll always know which specific beasts you\u2019re about to face. Select your skills appropriately, and you might just come out alive.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Elroy Saltzherr: Programming</p>\n<p>Mason Kubiak: Programming</p>\n<p>Ethan Goldreyer: Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a9e04c14fb5c69a4ad188c116d6d7cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Koobysnack"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
