Defeat your enemies to get more and more points, until you can't hold anymore. <br/></p>\n<p>Use the W A S D keys to move around, and your mouse Left Click to dash to the direction you clicked. Clicking AND walking in the same direction is extra effective. Enemies hit by the dash receive damage, otherwise, the player is the one that receives damage.<br/></p>\n<p>Please consider that the game is still in development and that almost everything is subject to change, and also that more content will be available in future versions. I'm extremely open to suggestions.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f85afb823ef65eb567f77e6f9072cb6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Doctor Moonbad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
