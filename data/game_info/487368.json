Use power-ups to survive, but be careful and watch your resources, you can die in many different ways!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is currently in alpha. Checkout my devlog to see what is still in development.</p>\r\nResources\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game is all about managing your resources.\u00a0Pay careful attention to your\u00a0health, fuel\u00a0and\u00a0ship temperature if you wish to survive.</p>\r\nHealth\r\n<p>You start with full HP when the game begins. Contact with asteroids or overheating will result in a loss of HP. You can pick up more health packs as the game progresses.\u00a0</p>\r\nFuel\r\n<p>Fuel is what allows you to move around the level. You start with full fuel but be careful, you will need to collect fuel canisters if you hope to stay alive.</p>\r\nTemperature\r\n<p>Your laser will cause your ship to overheat. Pay careful attention to how hot your laser is so you don't take damage. Not shooting for a few seconds is enough to cool your ship down :)<br/><br/></p>\r\nPower-ups\r\n<p>To add some complexity to the game I added a couple powerups. Its almost impossible to complete later levels without utilize these :)<br/></p>\r\nShield\r\n<p>Projects you from damage. Each hit reduces your shields strength.<br/></p>\r\nInsta-Kill\r\n<p>Increased laser damage which destroys asteroids on first contact. <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n[up arrow] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= forward thrust\r\n[back arrow] \u00a0 = reverse thrust\r\n[left arrow] \u00a0 = rotate left\r\n[right arrow] \u00a0= rotate right\r\n[space bar] \u00a0\u00a0 = shoot\r\n[m] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 = enable / disable music", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d5322e080aad8f44ff77fe52f7c582b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rcarlso"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
