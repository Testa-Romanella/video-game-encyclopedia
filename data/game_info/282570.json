The plot of the game is based arround our main character, Grant, a young man who discovers that he was genetically engineered, and that there is life outside the lab he is confined in. He confronts his father, the main scientist, but he declares that he is far too unexperienced and they have to keep his existence in secret.<br/></p>\n<p>He and his best friend plan an escape: make a controlled explosion to keep the scientist occupied, and then sneak out of the lab. However the explosion escalated, it was far more powerfull that they thought it will be and in the process, the main system that locks all doors malfunctions, freeing all the monstrous creations that were imprisioned in the laboratory. <br/></p>\n<p>As a result, his friend dies and Grant loses control of himself, his powers finally develop: he can read the last thoughts of creatures -<em>which are definitelly not serious, by the way</em>- and he can shoot energy balls.
