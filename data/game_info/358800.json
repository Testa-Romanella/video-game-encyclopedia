This weeks theme was 10 seconds or less and the way i tackled the theme was to have a timer on the sword. as soon as you pickup the sword the timer starts and once you kill an enemy it resets.</p>\n<p>Try to kill all the enemies without letting your timer run out but also watch out for your health.</p>\n<p>Please leave feedback and comments as i'd love to hear what you think. And also keep watching my itch page for more of my game a week projects there will be at least 9 others to come over the semester.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left click to attack</p>\n<p>Right click to move towards where you click</p>\n<p>ESC to exit game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02be72b21ba4dad261ad6487789fe9e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zodrodo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
