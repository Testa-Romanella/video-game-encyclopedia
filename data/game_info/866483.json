But beware, oilfields are burning, the transport of oil can go wrong, oil can leak from pipeline or others try to sabotage your pipeline. They can use their hard-earned money to buy more oil wells to expand their empire. Drill for oil, put out burning oil fields, repair pipelines, prevent explosive devices from detonating. Earn enough money to buy a Central Storage where you can collect and barrel the oil. The barrels can then be sold at a better price. The warehouse can be expanded. The individual storage units must be serviced, otherwise they will be lost and with them the oil stored in them. Also, don't forget to upgrade the bottling plant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>119 Possible locations to drill for Oil.<br/><br/>5 different biomes<br/><br/>Customization of player estates.<h3>Miscellaneous Events</h3><br/>Oil well fire<br/><br/>Tanker accident<br/><br/>Sobotage on the pipeline<br/><br/>Pipe ruptures on the pipeline<h3>In planning </h3><br/>More biomes in different locations<br/><br/>More random Events", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T05:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/ccc847769b68297285e4e82ab377e916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Josh"], "esrb_rating": null}
