{"id": 507113, "slug": "midnight-cipher-flux", "name": "Midnight Cipher - Flux", "name_original": "Midnight Cipher - Flux", "description": "<p>Our game takes place in a city post-EMP detonation, where industrial technology has just barely survived. There\u2019s basic electricity- but no longer instant messages, or any form of immediate social interaction. Communication between people has been taken over by mega-corporations, acting as the digital postal service. It\u2019s your job to deliver these precious messages from one terminal to another- but solving the puzzle of where those terminals are?.. That\u2019s a new difficulty in itself. You have to learn to traverse across this 3D platformer.</p>\n<p>\tNow, that\u2019s a very pretty description, but in terms of game design, the large gameplay loop is to complete deliveries, earn money, and purchase upgrades. Inside of that, the medium gameplay loop consists of: picking up a message, decrypting the location (in any way you choose, or a diversifier), and delivering the message to that correct location. Finally, the small moment-to-moment gameplay loop is all about platforming and deciphering location data.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Missions are designed to encourage replayability. The player starts out as an email postal delivery employee for the mega-corporation. At this point the player could happily continue playing day-in and day-out completing endless, randomly generated deliveries to earn money. However, you\u2019ll soon discover the only way to make a change is to break the game\u2019s rules (another diversifier). Only then, will you earn enough respect with the underground railroad to make a change and break free from an oppressive monopoly (a Theme).</p>\n<p>**This game has been a real challenge for us because we were learning how to use software we'd never used before! For that reason, we did take advantage of the gracious Unreal Engine Marketplace, and used some of their free assets.</p>\n<p>***We did find a few bugs while building the project- one being that the main menu would consistently crash with every build. The downloadable 7zip file does not have the main menu bug. ...because it is the game (built)\u00a0without a main menu.
