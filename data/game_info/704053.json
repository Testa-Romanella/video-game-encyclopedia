The game is an adaptation of a french sci-fi book by Teddy Toussaint\u00a0 called \"Le Premier Projet\".\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Featuring\u00a0music by Grizzly Cogs.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The game takes place in 2092 and centers around DAN who work for ReWild, a company that own most of the species DNA on Earth to sell clones for food, zoo, sport... During one of his mission he will found a strange spaceship. This is the beggining of a great adventure\u00a0\u00a0who will lead him through the universe.</p>\n<p>The game comes as a ROM file, to play it you will need to download an emulator to your device. For PC users I recommend BGB Emulator and have included a config file in the folder for the best set up for the game.
