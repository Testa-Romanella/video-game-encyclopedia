Unfortunately, his trailer park home is a bunker and requires the strongest type of material you can absorb to knock down his doomsday bunker door, diamonds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Work your way up the material scale to eventually achieve fists of diamond to exact your revenge. Run amok through your suburban neighborhood to find what you need before you lose interest in your goal!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The controls for this absolutely punchtastic game are W, D, S, A, for directional movement. The camera and the punching are controlled by using the mouse and left-clicking respectively.
