This idle game combines the elements of simulation and strategy to create a truly engaging experience for gamers of all ages. As you embark on your quest, you will find yourself in the role of a medieval lord, seeking to build a powerful kingdom by mining resources, upgrading your castle, and completing various quests.<br/><br/>The game is designed to challenge your skills as you progress through various levels. You start with a basic house that you can upgrade up to level 23. To upgrade your house, you will need to gather resources such as wood, stone, and iron. These resources can be obtained by mining in the nearby forest or quarry. You can also harvest crops in your fields to gather food resources for your workers.<br/><br/>As you progress in the game, you can buy more powerful pickaxes to mine resources faster. These pickaxes will allow you to gather resources in less time and with less effort. You can also hire workers to mine for you, and upgrade them to mine even more and faster. Upgrading your workers will require more resources, but the benefits of having skilled workers will be worth the effort.<br/><br/>One of the exciting features of Medieval Idle: Quest is the ability to craft armor. As you mine resources, you can use them to craft armor for your knights. Armor is essential for your knights as they venture out on quests to battle various enemies. The armor will provide your knights with the protection they need to face the dangers that lie ahead.<br/><br/>Completing quests is another important part of the game. You will receive quests from various characters, and each quest will require you to gather specific resources or craft certain items. Completing quests will reward you with experience points, resources, and gold. As you gain experience points, you will level up and unlock new features and abilities.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T06:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0ee2dd5f24ce91f708236c03dd5dd4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGF Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IGF Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
