The published design can be described as a level-based shooter with the aim being to prevent the loss of money at a casino\u00a0as much as you can! To do so, you will play as a dice with 6 sides, each corresponding to a different weapon. You can access a new weapon by interacting with the reroll icons around the map which will swap your current weapon for a random new one.\u00a0\u00a0Your job will be to ward off the evils of gambling as they attempt to take your money.\u00a0 Can you strike a balance between protecting yourself and conserving rerolls?</p>\n<p>We had many other ideas that we did not have time to implement, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Melee weapons</li><li>a \"+\" item generated on the maps which would add a side to your dice. Enables a wider range of weapon reroll choices.</li><li>Unique mechanics for all the themed levels, including:<ul><li>Billiards with rolling ball obstacles</li><li>Poker with a sectioned map with another element of randomness with what occurs in each section</li></ul><ul><li>Roulette with a spinning board and balls dropped on the map</li></ul></li><li>Animations and on-hit effects for enemies, health bars for enemies</li></ul>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Levels do not end when you complete them. You'll have to reload the page, sorry!</li><li>Some enemies' bullets fire in the wrong directions</li><li>Enemies are jittery and don't move properly</li><li>Enemies don't deal contact damage</li><li>Many weapons, enemies, and bullets are\u00a0unbalanced; for example, some guns have extremely long reload times</li><li>Level 5 has no enemies at all</li><li>Levels 2, 3, and 4 are extremely difficult and drawn out</li></ul>\n<p>With this being our 2nd year participating in GMTK, we can say that this was a great experience with many, many improvements. We hope you will enjoy the game as much as we did making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/84926ce53996515d920f7a15c61bbc43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Last Minute Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
