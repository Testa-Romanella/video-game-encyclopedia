IT'S LIKE THEY'RE REALLY THERE! <br/>- Simply flick the screen to throw a shuriken in the direction of your flick and slay your ninja enemies! <br/>- Throw special fire and lightning shuriken! <br/>- 2 Modes: Play the game and try to survive, or switch to SAFE MODE and enjoy the Augmented Reality effects without being attacked! You can still hurl deadly stars at the ninjas though! <br/>- Awesome 3D graphics. <br/>- Your movements control the game. Simply look around you, line up your cross hairs with your target, and tap to shoot. Swipe up to reload, then keep shooting! It's totally different to anything else, and very addictive! <br/><br/>WARNING: When using Augmented Reality please be aware of your surroundings! Be careful of the people and things around you.
