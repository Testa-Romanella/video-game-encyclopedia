{"id": 703931, "slug": "exit-row", "name": "EXit Row", "name_original": "EXit Row", "description": "<p>You're finally ready for a vacation. You've made it to the airport. You're through security. Your flight leaves in 7 minutes, but that's plenty of time! Time to mindlessly scroll social media while you wait. <br/></p>\n<p>As you begin to scroll your Croaker app, you come across a horrifying sight. No, not your uncle posting another one of his opinions... It's your ex! They are waiting for a flight out of the same airport :( Lucky for you, they tend to overshare on social media, so you're pretty sure you can avoid them... So long as your phone's battery stays alive, that is...</p>\n<p>EXit Row is a light-hearted horror-style game made for the GoGodot Game Jam (Theme: Energy Source).</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVES:<br/></p>\n<p>The objective is to be in your terminal, bag in hand, when your flight takes off. You want to be ready for takeoff <strong>without </strong>running into your ex. You cross paths and they stick around you for too long, you'll be pulled into a very awkward exchange, ending the game.</p>\n<p>To win, be in the terminal marked on your ticket at the time your ticket specifies (7 minutes after the start time).</p>\n<p>To view your ticket, open up your phone and click the center-right icon (the plane taking off). If your phone goes black, your battery died and you have to go find one of the phone charging stations provided by the National Republic of Godot airport (NRG Charger) and stand on it to replenish your battery.<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Helpful tips:</p>\n<p>You can use your Croaker app (the frog app in the top right of your phone) to get rough position updates from your previous partner, but be careful! There's a lot of junk on there, and those old phone batteries drain quickly...<br/></p>\n<p>Only two of your apps open at the moment, Croaker and your Airport app. Having them open drains your battery quickly, so use them wisely! If your phone goes black, it is dead and you have to charge it to access the information again. You can always use the apps on the charger if you need a bit more time!<br/></p>\n<p>You can ditch your bag to run from your ex faster if they find you. Just make sure you remember where you left it! You can't leave without it.</p>\n<p>You can check your departure time and gate with the airport app. Use the terminal map in the center of the airport to make sure you know where you need to end up!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS:</p>\n<p>Currently, the player might sometimes overstep their bag without picking it up. Hoping to fix it by game jam deadline, but we'll see if I get there :)</p>\n<p>Also, under some circumstances if the player drops their bag too close to a wall, it will clip through the wall and become un-pick-upable. At that point you cannot win and should restart. Apologies for the time wasted!<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>GAME LENGTH: 7 minutes to win, fewer if you're too slow.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>## Mouse-righty:</p>\n<p>WASD movement</p>\n<p>7 or X - drop bag</p>\n<p>\u00a08, E - pull up phone</p>\n<p>0, ESC, or R - put phone away</p>\n<p>9, Q - close apps</p>\n<p>Space - scroll to next social media post when in Croaker app<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse-click to use apps on your phone</p>\n<p>## Mouse-lefty (* these need fixing, apparently itch doesn't like the brackets?):</p>\n<p>arrow-key movement</p>\n<p>Shift or ` - drop bag</p>\n<p>1 - pull up phone <br/></p>\n<p>2 - close apps</p>\n<p>3 or ESC- put phone away</p>\n<p>Space - next social media post</p>\n<p>Mouse-click to use apps on your phone</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>#Credits!</p>\n<p>All assets\u00a0(artwork and music) were generated for the GoGodot Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Dylan Lounsberry (Dlounsberry.bandcamp.com)</p>\n<p>Airport photos by Tina Wiley</p>\n<p>Everything else (\"art,\" coding, story, design, etc.) by Zach Lounsberry (@YouCarryOats on Twitter)</p>\n<p>Assets generated in Aseprite with some support from GIMP and TileSetter<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds are Creative Commons 0 wav's from freesound.org<br/></p>\n<p>Color palettes from https://pokepalettes.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Huge thanks to HeartBeast and Lucy Lavend whose tutorials made this possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Hugest thanks to the Godot devs and community for an amazing open source tool to make game design possible for noobs!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e31cb271fda9ff29cb72d955593912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YouCarryOats"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
