Before he can get there, however, there is a puzzle to solve. You move Pushy step by step and, through trial and error, determine how the different elements of the puzzle operate, and what tasks need to be done. For example, Pushy must move obstacles and dump a red ball into a red hole. After completing all relevant tasks, move Pushy to his home. If you solved everything correctly, you will advance to the next level!<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022 250 built-in levels<br/>\u2022 Genius-Pack (86 brand-new levels and graphics) available as in-app purchase<br/>\u2022 Collect all coins and become a \"Pushy Meister\"!<br/>\u2022 Skip levels (using your coins)<br/>\u2022 Game Center Leaderboards<br/>\u2022 LEVEL EDITOR: create your own levels!<br/>\u2022 Send/receive levels via Airdrop, Bluetooth or by email!<br/>\u2022 Unlock all editor elements by solving all built-in levels<br/>\u2022 8 Pushy songs<br/>\u2022 Easy touch control (tap, drag or swipe), or ...<br/>\u2022 Control Pushy with your face on devices with Face ID<br/>\u2022 Undo moves<br/>\u2022 Save game on exit and resume later<br/>\u2022 Up to 5 player accounts<br/>\u2022 Landscape and split screen/multitasking on iPads<br/>\u2022 Online backup and restore of your player accounts <br/>\u2022 Fast access to the last played level<br/>\u2022 Listen to your favorite music or podcasts while playing<br/>\u2022 Share to Facebook, Twitter a.s.o.<br/>\u2022 Handoff: Start a level on one device and finish it on another<br/>\u2022 Record and save your game play: make your own Let's Play videos<br/>\u2022 Apple Watch App<br/>\u2022 iPad/iPhone/iPod universal!<br/>\u2022 Supports all new devices and iOS versions<br/><br/>The first few levels can be solved very quickly. However, as new elements are added, you will encounter very demanding puzzles that may take many attempts to figure out. There are more than 200 different built-in levels, with varying degrees of difficulty. The \"Genius-Level Pack\", a separate set of more than 80 levels available as an in-app purchase, provides even more challenges. Each level must be solved in order to advance to the next one. After only a few levels you'll come to appreciate what Pushy really is: a logic game that is a lot of fun! Each level will create new challenges to your intelligence. In advanced levels, Pushy will be able to move heavy stone blocks out of the way, cleverly bypass electrical spots to get through the sliding doors and free up a path through offices littered with bullets. But, watch out for trap doors and other alarms you may trigger!<br/><br/>There are loads more things to do than in classic sokoban!<br/><br/>Have fun!<br/><br/>(EVERY level is solvable!)<br/><br/>\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/><br/>NEED HELP? <br/><br/>Visit us at<br/>\u2022 YouTube:<br/>  www.youtube.com/pushymeister<br/><br/>\u2022 Facebook<br/>  www.facebook.com/pushymeister<br/><br/>follow @pushymeister on Twitter<br/><br/>or send an e-mail to: <br/>  pushy@support.medienwerkstatt.de", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-25T15:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f7/5f738ec660c0d724995649e3ad9baff4.jpg", "website": "http://www.pushymeister.com/Pushy-Web/Pushy_for_iPhone.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["medienwerkstatt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Medienwerkstatt M\ufffdhlacker Verlagsges.mbH"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
