The game constantly spawns blue balls to bounce around the screen, dodge them as long as you can, otherwise you lose.</p>\n<p>Losing after around 10 balls being spawned makes a fullscreen jump scare pop in the screen.</p>\n<p>Just click at the center of the screen again to restart the game. Your highscore will be automatically saved after each round.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cb8af4ea8b4307b8cd1ed7951521eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Space.cpp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
