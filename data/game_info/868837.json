It is just made for me to learn programming, game development, and the SFML library. It would be helpful if you could look at the GitHub repo, take a look at the code, and tell me what you think of my codebase's jumbled mess. Any and all criticism is welcome, truly.</p>\n<p>All the assets(sprites and audio) I made myself. The sprite was drawn on Pixelart.com, and the audio was made using BFXR.</p>\n<p>Please do not donate to this game.\u00a0I know you were not going to, but just in case. And if there are any donations I will refund them.</p>\n<p>Thank you and enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T11:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e17568431cf58cc374fd3cab70994b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MohamedA.G"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
