Your hairs begin to rise as you swiftly grab your coat, hat and trusted hookshot, and venture out to track the culprit down - and make them pay for their crimes.</p>\n<p>As you follow them, they notice you and start sprinting towards the abandoned docks! You start sprinting too, cutting corners to gain on them, desperate to catch them before they slip out of your paws. Right as you were gaining on them, you miscalculate the gap between two roofs and tumble towards the ground!</p>\n<p>Your reflexes are immaculate, so you land safely, but there is no sight of them in between the dock\u2019s buildings. Knowing there is no way but forward at the dock the culprit tried to hinder your progress by making a mess, locking doors, and ruining the path across the dreadful water.</p>\n<p><strong>You need to hurry to clear your way through - it's only a matter of time before they escape!</strong></p>\n<p>====<strong>CONTROLS</strong>====<br/></p>\n<p>WASD to move, mouse to aim/shoot.\u00a0 Also works on controller</p>\n<p>====<strong>CREDITS</strong>====<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BluebsTopCat<br/></strong>@bluebscat<br/>Artist</p>\n<p> <strong>Laura Heimann<br/></strong>@indiegesindel<br/>Programmer <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Nor\u00e9n<br/></strong>UI &amp; Producer <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Zoe Hickman<br/></strong>@thewispsoftime<br/>Gameplay and Level Designer <br/></p>\n<p><strong>A mysterious cat in a trench coat<br/></strong>Music &amp; Sound Effects Producer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab45b5248fe7f9c0ca93df314401474.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Blueberry", "Zeeviii", "indiegesindel", "thewispsoftime"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
