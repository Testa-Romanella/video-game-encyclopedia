With the help of Pixel Crushers' Dialogue System, the small interactive area was made. Another goal of this project was to craft a story where there player gets to infer what the clues and ending can be rather than telling the player outright. This was achieved by making the writing give hints and leave off certain details so that players can feel free to think about what each aspect means.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developer's Commentary:</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Controls:</em></p>\n<p>Mouse - Move Camera</p>\n<p>AWSD - Move Character</p>\n<p>Tab - Quest Log</p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em></p>\n<p>Story and Design - Danny L\u00a0Daniel Lopez - Game Designer (myportfolio.com)</p>\n<p>Environmental Art\u00a0 - Lukas Bobor found on\u00a0Abandoned Asylum | 3D Urban | Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Characters and Animations were from\u00a0Mixamo</p>\n<p>Used Dialogue System from Pixel Crushers found on\u00a0Dialogue System for Unity | AI | Unity Asset Store</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:20:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/94533a46793154cd30b6820af8d57236.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invalid_Name_404"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
