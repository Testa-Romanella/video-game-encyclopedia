They take a lot of fire before dying and fling bulbs of acid at you. When you get a few of these spawned at the same time you are in a world of hurt.<br/></p>\n<p>You only have 3 lives - as is standard with arcades - so the game does not last too long. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong> - for menus<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> - Left \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>D</strong> - Right</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Fire</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong> - Halo Fire (powerful arc fire but uses a lot of gun charge)</p>\n<p><strong>Esc</strong> - Pause\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>M</strong> - toggle music</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>All art/sprites, music and coding by Cacophaction</p>\n<p>Main music \"Space Tanking Tentacles\" by Cacophaction.
