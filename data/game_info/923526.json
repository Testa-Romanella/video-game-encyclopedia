There are three levels in total, and each level's difficulty will gradually escalate. I added a helpful feature that will revive the player every time he falls off the map to help him finish the game smoothly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T08:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be676316d1246e041fe90930f48f7d34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["shangyu xie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
