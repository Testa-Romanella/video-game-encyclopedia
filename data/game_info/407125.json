There are different types of enemies, each with its unique feature. You have at your disposal the basic attack, which is right click, and 4 spells. Be careful on how you use those spells as they drain your mana.<br/></p>\n<p>When an enemy dies there is a chance for items to drop. These items will help you get stronger. Armor pieces will increase your resistances, weapons will increase your damage. There are 2 types of damages, attack and power. Attack are your right clicks/melee attacks and increasing armor will decrease the damage dealt by these attacks. Power are the magical attacks, these include your spells and projectiles, and building magic resistance (MR) will help you survive these attacks. Be careful enemies have armor and magic resistance too, play around their weaknesses. \r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Spells </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Q \u2013 Meteor: Using your magical power create a meteor which will fall from the sky and annihilate your enemies\r\n  </li><li>W \u2013 Spirit Wave: Concentrating your power and releasing it around you to create an energy field around you, which damages enemies nearby.
