Be aware of bumping around, because your body is as fragile as your feelings! But don't worry, both you and your best pal B.A.L.L.O.O.N are big believers in reincarnation, therefor death is not the end of your journey, just be careful to not reincarnate into some kind of sloth or alpaca :|</p>\n<p><strong>How my submission matches the theme</strong></p>\n<p>Your controlled B.O.T has to manage two responsibilities at the same time. Firstly he responsible for his best pal and guides it by pushing him around (doesn't sound very friendly but it is!). At the same time he needs to be careful himself and evade any collisions (even with his pal!).</p><p>Also viewport follows B.A.L.L.O.O.N, this means that player controlled B.O.T movements are limited to a small area and B.O.T's movements are directly binded to B.A.L.L.O.O.N which creates some difficult (friendship testing) situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move mouse around to move B.O.T</p>\n<p>Push left mouse button to push away B.A.L.L.O.O.N</p>\n<p><strong>Third-party resources</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Unity; Visual Studio 2017 Community; Photoshop; Substance Designer 5;</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Me :|</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c823478c801676a89d9ce085d5c9ca04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMortal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
