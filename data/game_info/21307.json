All levels have a new element or a new enemy introduced, carefully created to fit the area they are in and often inspired by previous enemies's behaviour to give you a nice and smooth, but still, challenging experience. <br/><br/>The game is not created in the mind of giving the player another game to blast through. I wanted to maintain the horrible, yet enchanting difficulty old platformers like Megaman had. Rewarding the player for getting to know the enemy, their movements, how the levels work, finding the timers. The game is constructed in a way that everytime you game over, you do it knowing something new about the obstacle and get you closer to the finish line. <br/><br/>The gameplay is not always entierly linear and there are levels that provide alternative ways to mix things up a little and also encourage the player to try other ways to gain time or find more score. <br/><br/>Throughout the level you will find seeds that you can collect, these will give you score. You will also find caged animals, that award you when freed. Depending on your final score, you will get different endings.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3efdd4cc58b4c0e9e0b83a6a0ee0b336.jpg", "website": "http://johan-aronson.squarespace.com/drgreen/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johan Aronsson"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Johan Aronsson"], "esrb_rating": null}
