{"id": 43922, "slug": "gunheart", "name": "Gunheart", "name_original": "Gunheart", "description": "Gunheart is a co-op shooter built from the ground up for virtual reality. You and your friends will inhabit robotic bounty hunters trying to make a buck at the edge of the galaxy blasting aliens, exploring exotic locations and raking in cash to upgrade your rig. Along the way you\u2019ll master a large arsenal of weapons and unlock abilities that will reward you for working as a team.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBattle your way through hours of bug infested frontier, where the environments and encounters are remixed to make the bounties feel different every time you play. Missions are over a kilometer long and you\u2019ll never know what\u2019s around the next corner.  When other players drop in mid mission the game will dynamically adjust the difficulty so you'll be challenged whether you're playing solo or with a crew.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBack at the hub you\u2019ll be able to outfit your rig with an arsenal of space aged killing machines that will have you blasting, hacking and mowing \u2018em down with full motion control.  If you like getting a little more personal you can use your multi tool to grab barrels, crates and even badguys and use them as makeshift weapons, lob them off cliffs or just rip them limb from limb.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a bounty hunter you\u2019ll bring the action to the enemy, no waiting around for them to come to you. To get there you\u2019ll be armed with a full suite of locomotion options allowing you to teleport or strafe across the field and play Room scale, standing, or seated.  A full set of options allow users to easily switch between any control scheme they prefer, and additional options such as dynamic \"blinders\" are enable for increased comfort if desired.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSupports full cross-play between Oculus Touch and HTC Vive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946a9581cb9d2b97bb11f44bdf60809d.jpg", "website": "http://gunheartvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 44, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drifter"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Drifter"], "esrb_rating": null}
