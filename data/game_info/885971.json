The download below is an early access build which will be updated in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence and robots have advanced to the point where humans can no longer control them.\u00a0Because of this, humanity has regressed to a more analog society based on steam power and mechanics. Having difficulty harnessing renewable energy, robots have come back to take the Earth's remaining fossil fuels, including coal from mines in towns of the remaining human population.</p>\n<p>Defend the town and mining facility by building structures and using your weapon to fend off waves of robots that increase in number and power as the waves go on. The robots attack during the night, so you can use daytime wisely to build structures and ready yourself for the attack at night.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/left joystick for movement</li><li>Mouse/right joystick for camera controls</li><li>Tab / Select to swap between shooting and building mode<br/>\n</li><li>Left click / right trigger to shoot or place structures</li><li>Left and right brackets [ ] / left and right on Dpad to swap between structures</li><li>Escape / start for pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T13:34:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a39/a3997616f5ec3ea21a6c572580a98d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phillips-albright", "zach-harris"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
