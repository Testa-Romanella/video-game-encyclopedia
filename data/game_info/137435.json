When I came back to it, I realised I had a lot of solid code in this project (I had a combat/health system, AI, inventory and so on)  and decided I should put it to use, so I cobbled together some levels to show off the different things I had made. Although I must admit I went a bit into the weird end with this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8abf0b258c2da5f84cc5c24de76f3d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yeh_m8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
