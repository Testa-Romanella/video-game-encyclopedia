To move the ball you have \n      to tilt the playfield. Hold the Wii Remote controller horizontally. Tilt \n      it and the playfield will move. You can also play using the Wii Balance \n      Board (sold separately with Wii Fit). The ball is fragile; don't let it \n      fall too far. Don't touch deadly obstacles like spikes or acid pools. \n      Will you be tough enough to complete all 64 levels? You also have 25 \n      goals to accomplish. Completing them will increase your progress \n      percentage. The difficulty of the game adjusts itself according to your \n      skill. You'll come across special balls. Their behavior will be \n      explained during the game. Some balls are more fragile than others. Each \n      level has its own high scores. Try to be first on each one!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d5b79b4c9bfdad2dcb7c7914bd3e35.jpg", "website": "http://www.dk-games.com/Equilibrio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Wii"], "developers": ["DK Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["DK-GAMES", "DK Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
