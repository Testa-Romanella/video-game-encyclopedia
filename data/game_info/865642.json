{"id": 865642, "slug": "otto-the-otter", "name": "Otto The Otter", "name_original": "Otto The Otter", "description": "<p>The local fisherdragon lost his son! Looks like you'll have to find him again...</p>\n<p>This is a prototype for a future full game I wanted to make! It was inspired by the want to make a game that smoothly integrated both land and water physics, especially with controls that felt good to play with. While UnderwOtter came out first, this was the original idea that Otto was born from. I've since taken inspiration from games like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, and if you're looking forward to playing a full version of this game, support would be very much appreciated!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Walk/Swim through water<br/>Space - Jump/Dash through water<br/>A/D + Space - Walljump while pressing towards walls<br/>E - Use cannon</p>\n<p>Controller is supported! If you're having trouble exiting the window, use Alt+F4 to quit or Alt+Enter to exit fullscreen. I unfortunately did not have time to include quality of life additions like a pause screen.</p>\n<p>This game was made in Unity, with graphics made in Aseprite. Music was composed by me in LMMS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T10:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3852827461e8ceef6d84ef6a891640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Vecderg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
