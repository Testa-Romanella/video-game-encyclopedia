Its a small rhythm RPG sandbox where you create your own party of a Tank, a Mage, and an Angy person to fight polygonal enemies.</p>\n<p>The rhythm game is similar to something like Guitar Hero, however as you hit notes in time with the music, a special meter fills up. Once it is full, you can activate it to split one of the three lanes into two. You can end up with six lanes in total. More lanes means more notes, but also more potential to miss and take damage. Player damage is a character specific damage over time, where missing notes increases the constant HP drain. Once a party member's HP is zero, they no longer contribute damage to the enemy's health bar.<br/></p><p>There's only one in-game song so variety is limited, however there is a map editor in-game that I used to chart it, so if you want to you can totally add more songs (Not sure why you would though!).</p>\n<p>There will be bugs. I'm sorry about that. Please let me know what you were doing when it happened and I'll do my best to fix them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded3a3e236131cefe5b0e40933e604da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azure_Kytia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
