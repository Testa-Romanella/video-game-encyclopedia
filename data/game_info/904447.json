Decided\u00a0to make a little game. Inspired by games like 20 Mins till Dawn &amp; Vampire Survivors. My goal was to focus on the game design instead of the art (Mostly only do art/animations). Used my Own Assets (The Tiny Alchemist Series), some sounds from Shapeforms &amp; music from alkakrab.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's 4 different guns and 6 different gemstones. Was going to add a couple more heroes but decided to implement the mobile version... which took a bit longer than expected. Web version is playbable on mobile, APK file also available.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>ESC - Pause\u00a0</p>\n<p>Join my discord to leave feedback &amp; bugs</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Made With GDevelop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-04T16:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a35a000428e6848341d8b54c1917a994.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Penusbmic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
