{"id": 748568, "slug": "wilfred-the-hero", "name": "Wilfred the Hero", "name_original": "Wilfred the Hero", "description": "<p>Game starts where most other RPGs end. It&#39;s the day before the final battle in the eternal struggle between good and evil.</p>\n<p>Wilfred and his loyal squire Kyr-Stan prepare themselves for a last fight, but it&#39;s a strange hero we meet here: Wilfred is full of doubts about his power and his destiny, he dreams of a peaceful coexistence between monsters and heroes and in fact he is so stricken with fear that he hides under his blankets at night. So can he win and save his world anyway?</p>\n<p>&quot;Wilfred, the Hero&quot; is a RPG that was made with the RPG Maker 2003. But unlike most other games made with this tool, &quot;Wilfred, the Hero&quot; doesn&#39;t use any standard tiles and backgrounds, but consists of beautiful original graphics made by Teo Mathlein (&quot;Sunset over Imdahl&quot;). There is also an amazing soundtrack composed by Brandon Abley and a very unique system of fighting, levelling up and upgrading skills.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the game is just part one in a series of planned games and so it isn&#39;t very long (there should be about 5 - 10 hours of gameplay) and leaves you with an open end. But hopefully we will see more of Wilfred and Kyr-Stan in the future.
