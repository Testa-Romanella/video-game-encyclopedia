He had found out about Ludum Dare competition and he wanted to participate. <br/><br/>***** HOW *****<br/>He managed to create an almost complete game in less than 8 hours while traveling with his band . He developed everything primarily in a van and a hotel room. Unfortunately, he wasn't happy with a few aspects so he abandoned the game for a while. Few weeks later in Prague, he asked his fellow member to help him finish the game. They only needed 3 more days (and nights) to do so.<br/><br/>***** WHAT *****<br/>Escapology is a simple yet challenging puzzle solving game with a unique atmosphere, challenging levels and beautiful retina graphics. Your task in each level is to move one or more wooden balls into their designated positions. Controls are really simple, just swipe in any direction and the whole board will move. As you progress further in the game, those new puzzles will need more and more of your brain power to solve.<br/><br/>***** FEATURES *****<br/>- 6 game chapters<br/>- 86 handmade levels (and more coming soon)<br/>- Completely new, simple, but challenging gameplay<br/>- Beautiful retina graphics<br/>- Easy, medium, hard and extreme levels", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33bd9f0421a649f31697df977cc49947_6adwi3s.jpg", "website": "http://www.hyperbolicmagnetism.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hyperbolic Magnetism"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jan Ilavsky"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
