It is a video game about one\u2019s journey around guilt and loneliness as well as duty and survival.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you control an unnamed character fleeing their home planet, Baros IV, by choosing with your mouse what to do next. The goal is to reach a space shuttle called Baros IV Low-Orbit VTOL Elevator, or BILOVE.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a text heavy game and we\u2019re sorry if mistakes slipped in. Yet we hope you will like it at least half as much as we liked making it.</p>\n<p>The goal is to travel to the BILOVE in a limited amount of days without getting out of gas, food or mood. Every day, you can choose to explore a location or skip it. Every location can provide or cost you food, fuel and mood. You may even get hurt or find a rare upgrade!<br/>Sadly we didn't have the time to finish the UI and it doesn't indicate the number of days left (30 at the start). We also didn't have the time to implement the upgrades' effects so they are only for bragging rights, sorry.</p>\n<p>A known bug happens if you launch the game from another than your main screen. Doing so won't let the game start.<br/></p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ZQSD Team\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d1502983f559cb4fef10fe2ea3abb15a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kushala"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
