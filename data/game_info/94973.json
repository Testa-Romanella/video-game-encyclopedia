This will be very handy, you\u2019ll see!</p>\n<p>Oh, and be careful down there... It's pretty MANIC!</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Info:</strong></p>\n<p>The Bear Essentials took around two years to make from April 2015.\u00a0 It was released on Xmas Eve 2016.</p>\n<p>The tape and disk editions were released in 2017 and featured the map and a few new rooms, and also included Super Bonkey Kong as a B side.</p>\n<p>This version was updated in 2018 and includes all the features from the tape / disk edition, plus a new save game feature to address the difficulty of the game and a high score saver.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Code, graphics, music and sound effects by Graham Axten</p>\n<p>A very special thank you to Vanja Utne for the countless hours preparing and making the disk / tape editions of the game, for the awesome artwork and for realising my dream of releasing The Bear Essentials!</p>\n<p>(c) 2018 Pond Software / Graham Axten</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f9e2abdc86fba12a1dc22d3b5835f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Graham Axten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
