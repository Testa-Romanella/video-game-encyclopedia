Collect and lob bombs at your friends but be careful - explosions set off dormant bombs in chain reactions that are as deadly to the thrower as they are to everyone else! Play competitively or cooperatively across two different game modes.<h3>DeathMatch Mode </h3>Collect and throw bombs at each other across 9 unique maps in this competitive mode. Simple controls are easy to get the hang of but reward skilled, tactical gameplay. Watch out for level hazards and chain reactions!<h3>SlimeBomb Mode</h3>Choose a Map and a Challenge - a series of Slime enemies that chase players around the map in this cooperative mode. Work carefully with your friends to collect bombs and blow up the Slimes without letting them catch you. Complete 5 different map challenges alone or with up to four friends.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T05:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/87511b2de67c60e1a83b8d865b7a6476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narfox"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Narfox"], "esrb_rating": null}
