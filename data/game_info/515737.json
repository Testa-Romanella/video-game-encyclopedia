The following is a Proof-of-Concept, meant to be updated and expanded on in stages and very much meant to evolve with community support. In it's current stage, it allows a fair amount of Guided Exploration Learning for people interested in getting into Philippine Geography. Subdivided into 100km2 tiles, the National Map includes all 300,000 square kilometers of Philippine Territory with markers for the capitals of the 81 provinces, plus a handful of independent cities, popular resort destinations, and natural wonders. The following provinces, while still largely under development, also currently have explorable Provincial Pavilions - areas designed to celebrate a province's people, history, and culture concisely: + Cavite + Catanduanes + Mountain Province +Biliran +Tawi-Tawi</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>Islands Abridged is being written, designed, and developed by\u00a0Marthy Arguelles Angue\r\nwith the help of Dr.\u00a0Kathleen Ann Modina-Angue\r\nand\u00a0Cholo Salonga\r\nand with the support of\u00a0Gunship Revolution\r\nand\u00a0Roots&amp;Wings Online Magazine\r\n.</p>\n<p>Character illustrations was by Mclloyd Sumagpang and the Quiapo Free font is by Aaron Amar.
