I\u2019m Maria, I\u2019m a 20-year-old Game Design student from Germany. I have worked with Unity for about a year now and am happy to show what I have learned in this Game Jam. I wrote the game\u2019s code, did a lot of implementing and made the VFX for the game. I also worked on Post-Processing, put the scene together in Unity and made a Shader for the game. Everything I did in the project was created during the jam.  </p>\n<p>Hello, Daniel here. I am 18 years old and just graduated from High-School. This is the first game project I have ever worked on. My job was to create the art for the game. This includes the initial concepts, color palettes, 3D models, textures, sound effects as well as music. On the last day of the jam, I also focused on the presentation of the game online. The game assets were created in blender. While the music was created by hand, I have used royalty free sound libraries online to select the sound effects for the game, which we have credited in the game.  <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for checking out our game!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a03126592033d3802ea43b16227f8ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["tranquilmage"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
