{"id": 381570, "slug": "colours-pythonsweet", "name": "Colours (pythonsweet)", "name_original": "Colours (pythonsweet)", "description": "Colours\r\n<p>Colours is a game where you have to type in the text colour instead of the text. Even though sounding easy, it is relatively tricky. You will have to type an answer in the entry box given. Each correct colour will give you one point. At the end of thirty seconds, you will be shown a score. If you have any suggestions tell me so I can change it in a future update.</p>\r\nProblems that might happen...\r\n<p>Windows might think this app is dangerous, just like some other antiviruses. To run the program, click\u00a0<em>More Info</em> then click\u00a0<em>Run Anyway</em> or something closely related to that. Some antiviruses might interoggate it, but eventually will find no viruses in it. To prevent an antivirus\u00a0from suspecting the program everytime you run it, go into the antivirus app and make the app an exception, so it will run without interruptions. But even after doing that sometimes it might reload, but that won't change gameplay or cause any problems. So no need to worry.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75244be1df678522ccffe160c5020a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pythonsweet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
