Armed with a pickaxe, a sword, and a backpack full of gadgets and gizmos, you must explore the depths and fight off dangerous creatures to get to valuable treasure. But beware: nothing you find is safe until you reach the surface, and there are more dangerous things than monsters lurking in the tunnels...</p>\n<p>Dig deep, slay monsters, and get rich. Or lay traps near the surface and ambush your friends as they  return, weakened from their battles. Steal their gold and the glory is yours.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Dwarven Depths was released on the Xbox Live Indie Games platform. Nine years later, I'm porting the game to the PC to give it a second life. This release includes the previously-unreleased Dream.Build.Play update, featuring more enemies, balance fixes, and a whole lot of explosions.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/83209e7cbdd19c64dad3b5243f3e4cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Galecki"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
