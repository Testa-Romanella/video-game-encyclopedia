If you stop moving and your HP is already \r\nfull, it will slowly build an (invisible) meter toward raising your max \r\nbullet cap. If you are out of bullets, you can continue shooting at the \r\ncost of 1 HP per shot. \r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Created by Joshua McCrary (@joshdangit) and Jacob McCrary (@studio_giblets).</p><p>Music: \"Cascade\" by Kubbi, \"Double the Bit\"s by TeknoAXE<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84f/84f69b5708bda5ed120f61cae552331d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua McCrary"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
