You will know me as the girl who's life was ruined by the same winds which used to calm me down.\r\n\r\nInstead, mass destruction and terror rang throughout my Town. It's as if the winds made up their mind. Backstabbing and painful.\r\n<p><strong>Come find me, I need help making a choice.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Fujita is my Game, about a girl who was unfortunate enough to witness the terror of a Tornado. This game utilizes varying art styles but are all drawn by me. There are choices and two endings, only one is True. The choices don't vary much in effect, I'm too busy for that.<br/></p>\n<p><em>There are minimal sounds in this game. No blaring sirens or winds, but small ambient sounds to sell a setting. The only music of the game is provided by MusMus.
