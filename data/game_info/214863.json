You and another player control a space organism under attack. The objective is to be the last one alive. You need at least a controller to play. The game is meant to be played with two players (and, thus, two controllers), but you can play alone.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Shield that reflects projectiles and change them to your color.<br/>- Shield will be down for a few seconds after reflecting three projectiles.<br/>- Black hole that attract the player if he isn't moving.<br/><br/>Powerups to help you:<br/>- Heal gives the player + 1 hit point.<br/>- Force field sets off a a big wave destroying all projectiles that it touches.<br/>- Ice that freeze your opponent in place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be5cc582803b08fb80aa35894a2ab68f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BarbeBleue"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
