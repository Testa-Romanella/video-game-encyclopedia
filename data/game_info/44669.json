Things move differently in space and this difference shouldn't be camouflaged or erased. This is a space game for people who can understand and use inertia, and do not expect a spaceship to behave like a boat or an airplane.<br/><br/>And it all works with simple controls. You turn with the mouse, left-click to fire guns, right-click to accelerate forward. By default, you roll using the scroll wheel. More complex ship functions are accessed via a left-hand menu that you can control with the keyboard.<br/><br/>Braking and strafing are luxuries for fighter pilots: nice, but far from vital. Large ships have maneuver thrusters that can push them along all axes, but they are low-power, useful only for trajectory fine-tuning. Smaller ships just turn and use the main thrusters for all their maneuvers. <br/><br/>Guns only fire straight forward, but since you're flying in hard vacuum, you can turn the ship to fire in any direction at any time. Other weapons include guided missiles (which can be shot down) and heavy capital-killer ordnance. <br/><br/>All controls can be remapped and the released game will have joystick and gamepad support. VR is not on the menu for now, but it will be added after release, if enough players ask for it.<br/><br/>In this game, you're a cadet trying to pass the Academy's flight trials and become a certified combat pilot. Each mission teaches and tests your ability in a certain kind of combat scenario. The bronze medal signifies basic ability and is not too hard to earn, as long as you can perform the required task. Silver and gold are progressively harder and require you to polish your tactics and precision. Finally, the Ace medal is the mark of the expert and requires skill, patience, cunning and considerable luck.<br/><br/>The planned missions and their current status are as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Currently in Early Access:</strong><br/><br/>Basic Flight<br/>The game's tutorial lets you familiarize yourself with the controls and shoot down some unarmed targets.<br/><br/>Obstacle Course<br/>Take a light fighter through an obstacle course. Improve your time to earn higher medals. You'll learn the basics of flight and maneuvering and blow up some practice targets along the way.<br/><br/><strong>Soon in Early Access:</strong><br/><br/>Assault<br/>Fly a Fighter/Attack ship to take out enemy fixed defenses. Dodge flak and missiles and deliver your package.<br/><br/><strong>Planned Missions:</strong><br/><br/>Space Superiority<br/>Dogfight against enemy fighters. You'll fly the state of the art. Good hunting !<br/><br/>Point Defense<br/>Fly a patrol to protect a friendly base against inbound torpedo salvos. Master interception and shooting down moving targets. Let none through !<br/><br/>Bombing Run<br/>Use a heavy bomber to level an enemy base. Avoid or neutralize fixed defenses, dodge or shoot down enemy patrols, leave only smoke and rubble behind.<br/><br/>Search &amp; Rescue<br/>Pick up ejected friendly pilots, adrift in space. Avoid minefields, defenses and enemy patrols. Angel Duty is entrusted only to the best pilots. Save your comrades from a cold, lonely end.<br/><br/>This is, broadly, The Plan. There may be changes, depending on community feedback during Early Access. Join the ride, contribute feedback and suggestions, and most importantly: Good Hunting !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/999bd503f007655c77d0343af85120fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hellride Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hellride Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
