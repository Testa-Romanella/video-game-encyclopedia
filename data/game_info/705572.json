Too bad you're in the forest on a burning skateboard... And\u00a0as if that\u00a0wasn't enough, you also\u00a0have to impress three British\u00a0art dealers by creating patterns in the forest with your burning skateboard, which\u00a0will later create a painting for them to watch in their art gallery.</p>\n<p>But be careful: The art dealers\u00a0like extensive\u00a0art, but they also care a lot\u00a0for the environment. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Made for the\u00a0One Minute Game Jam #4\u00a0(theme: \"destroy\") in December\u00a02021!
