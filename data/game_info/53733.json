The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser, and missile weapons, which are much more powerful. The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross, and Ace; but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked. One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-14T22:44:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbc360bd449786258f10d477156fe3e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["KID", "Taxan"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito", "Mattel", "Taxan"], "esrb_rating": null}
