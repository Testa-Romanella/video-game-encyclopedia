As he introduces himself in the beginning of the game, he explains that he enjoys killing people. And that&#39;s exactly what the player will have to do while controlling this character. Bargon enters a small village, where he is able to kill anyone, including little children. If the &quot;attack&quot; key is pressed when Bargon is near a young woman, he rapes her instead of killing. Most of the people he kills can&#39;t defend themselves and are completely powerless while he is slaughtering them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/307d8208ccb88280e6fb6f1f734661ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
