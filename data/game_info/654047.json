With fixed cameras, tank controls and visuals that are reminiscent of the good old days, you will truly feel like it's 1996 again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Unravel the mystery behind the town of Normoth, gather resources and survive the horrors of this forsaken place. You will once again enter the world of survival horror ... good luck!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Haunted PS1 Summer of Shivers 2021 where I challenged myself to make a classic survival horror game in just 30 days.
