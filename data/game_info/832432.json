{"id": 832432, "slug": "supervhs", "name": "SuperVHS", "name_original": "SuperVHS", "description": "<p>A mildly famous warehouse lurks somewhere deep in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Hidden by relentless snow (or possibly that technology from 1994's <em>The Shadow)</em>, spoken of only under whispered breath. Legends of sets, props, and bad movies as far as the eye can see. No one has returned from this place in a thousand years. No one...until now!</p>\n<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;SUPER VHS&lt;&lt;&lt;</em>\n<strong>| Official Trailer | <br/>Watch on YouTube in 4K!</strong>\n<p>With the magic of space age computer technology, every real world set and prop from the RedLetterMedia warehouse has been obsessively recreated, and each is ready to be picked up, dusted off, and thrown into a whole bunch of empty beer bottles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Support RedLetterMedia on </strong><strong>YouTube and </strong><strong>Patreon!<br/></strong>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong><em>System Requirements (Windows/MacOS):</em></strong>\n<p>It should run well on any 2016/2017 era Nvidia 10-series GPU or better, especially if you turn down the amount of booze.\u00a0 Runs fine on a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, also.</p>\n<strong><em><br/>Virtual Reality Edition:</em><br/></strong>\n<p>The V.R version is very simple, just the basic level with all of the interactable props - no menu, UI, gameplay loop etc. It's pretty neat to see the space in 1:1 scale. You can throw so many bottles. Performance will definitely vary depending on your system.</p>\n<strong>| Virtual Reality Edition Trailer | <br/>Watch on YouTube in 4K!</strong>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong><em>Credits:<br/></em></strong>\n<p><strong>This is a free, fan-made game, and is not authorised, endorsed, or sponsored by Red Letter Media in any way. </strong>All RLM props, sets, concepts etc. are created by and property of Red letter Media.</p>\n<p><strong>Please send any complaints and/or feature length critical video essays to:</strong><br/><strong>\u00a0- twitter.com/reaction105</strong><br/><strong>\u00a0- </strong><strong>instagram.com/reaction105/</strong><br/><strong>\u00a0- </strong><strong>youtube.com/reaction105/</strong></p>\n<p>You can buy me a coffee here if you like.
