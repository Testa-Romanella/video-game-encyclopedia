It is not complicated at all as\u00a0your main goal is to crash meteorites that fly near the Earth. You get points for every destroyed meteorite. The number of points you get depends on the size of the meteorite and your accuracy. The better your accuracy is the more points you get.<br/></p>\n<p>Some of the meteorites are filled with the following reinforcements (bonuses) for your ship:</p>\n<ul><li>life renewal</li><li>ship speed increase</li><li>shot speed increase</li><li>shot strength increase</li></ul>\n<p>Since this is the first game written by me, I really look forward to all your comments!</p>\n<p>If you like my game, feel free to buy me a cup of coffee (donations allowed).
