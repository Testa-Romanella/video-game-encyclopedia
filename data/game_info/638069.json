At least once a week one of the huts is broken into and the families were robbed. One day the Little Theo is watching one of the robbers lose a piece of gold on the run. He takes all his courage together, collect the lost piece and bring it back to the scared families. But little Theo has to be careful not to get caught doing it. Because the robbers are still out and about in the village and if they see him, they are sure not to let him out of your sight so quickly\u2026\u00a0\r\nMedieval Heist is a single player game in which you collect coins and bring them back to the right place. Clever action is required because the opponents are still running around the village and are chasing the player from a certain distance. The goal of the game is to collect a certain amount of coins depending on the level and bring them back to its rightful owners.\r\n</p>\n<p>The source code can be found on Github:\u00a0https://github.com/JanEisenhauerDE/medieval-heist\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51dbb10aa7c3f3a2b5011aaaaf13dbb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jan Eisenhauer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
