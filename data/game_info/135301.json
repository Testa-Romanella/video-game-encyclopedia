A charming Incremental Survival game made in 5 days for the 2018's Crypto Game Jam. You must mine bitcoins to buy and upgrade itens in order to survive as long as you can! All assets original made by me. Come play.</p>\n<p>DEVLOG: V.2.6</p>\n<p>- New \"Exhaustion\" system added to the Farm. Now, after grabbing the food produced four times, the farm will require a time to \"rest\" until producing food again.</p>\n<p>- The Farm now takes 12 hours instead of 6, to produced food.</p>\n<p>- When day passes, now the prices of food and tools on market might decrease as well, so you will be experiencing some eventual \"deflation\" on their prices.</p>\n<p>- Some glitches fixed. More visual aspects remade.</p>\n<p>Twitter: @oldmohave <br/></p><p>Join my Discord channel: https://discord.gg/VEDjrcP<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b892b6678c7a4952e0aa03754bd4b975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Old Mohave Games Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
