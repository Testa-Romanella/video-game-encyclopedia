There you can find an old rusty boat. If you manage to start it and open the gate you can escape that way.<br/><br/>You can protect yourself from Granny and Grandpa using one of the two different types of weapons you can find in the house. But it only stops them for a while. But it's worth it.<br/><br/>There are five different levels of difficulty.<br/>Extreme, Hard, Normal, Easy and Practice.<br/>If you play in Practice mode, you are in the house without Granny and Grandpa and you have the opportunity to try different things without major difficulties. But remember the house is not completely free from dangers.<br/><br/>Granny and Grandpa gives you five days in the house.<br/>If you have failed to escape after the last day... well, probably you can figure out what happens then.<br/><br/><br/>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T10:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a1c0fa77b8b54a74e455d7d23f536bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DVloper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
