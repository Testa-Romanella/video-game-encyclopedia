Aster prepared one of her rituals for the upcoming Fullmoon but notices that something feels off so she takes a look outside and she can't see the Moon. Something glowing falls behind her house and it turns out to be a fragment of the Moon which tells Aster that she broke apart due to the people not giving enough energy back but that they rather keep it for themselves. It's now your task to go on your way with your trusty scissor to claim back all the other Moon-Fragments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T17:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/855ef4589e41a704078a460371887062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diana", "kilianbrassel", "Pascal Fulle", "Paul Wegner"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
