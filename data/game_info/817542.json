I\u00a0made it during a 15-month Unity/C# course I took in Senac, a Brazilian school. It took me around 7 months to finish it (although I\u00a0didn't work on it every day). I\u00a0really hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>In Dead Sands, you are Sharifa, a lively young lady heir to a great ancient fortune. Now she is in Egypt to claim her treasures, but beware, for there are many traps and foul creatures on the way!
