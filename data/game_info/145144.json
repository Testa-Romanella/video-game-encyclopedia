Done over the weekend, I did about 70%+ of the programming. Game maker. The theme was AIDS treatment and prevention. Yeah. AIDS. You play as the immune system fighting off bacteria with antibodies, and you have to stop occasionally to take medication when there's a cooldown, via a keypress in the upper right hand of the screen. There's a short how-to accessible from the title screen that addresses the mechanics.<br/><br/>Overall I was happy with how the mechanics turned out, and how the game felt   in general, but it could have been better if there were more time to polish the level layout, controls and visuals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afd/afda3a1e9d409a745dbaaa2c49856908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiesetsu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
