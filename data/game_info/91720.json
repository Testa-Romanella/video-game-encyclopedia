This appears to be a false positive, even affecting some Steam games, and Unity is working with Microsoft to fix the detection to avoid false alarms.</p><p> I'm exploring whether there's anything I can do to the game to work around this, but in the meantime, you may need to exempt Last One Standing from this security check in order to play - but I understand if you're hesitant to do so.
