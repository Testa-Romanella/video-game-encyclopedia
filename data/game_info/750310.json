Your search has taken you to a mysterious cave, which will be the beginning of a strange journey into the depths of the world. Maybe other beings exist there, and few of them are friendly. Can you survive the trials ahead of you? And, will what you find be what you were looking for?</p>\n<p>The Dwoemer of the Drill Faced Goddess is a Visual Novel done in a retro style. The pain you will experience mirrors that of the protagonist. You will be given choices, and the choices will all have consequences. Each choice will show you something different, so I encourage you to give it a shot multiple times. This game was made for RETROMANIA, RMN&#39;s 10 Year Birthday Celebration, in 10 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T00:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc6e15e8ebb6abcaf882c7a4aaf0ef5.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/9870/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
