Look no further and check out Chain Wars: a collective card deck-based tower defense game with Citadels, Towers, Troopers, and whatnot!<br/>It\u2019s the smart yet easy-to-grasp mix of defense and offense tactics with a shot of luck that makes it special and you\u2014a fine strategist!<br/> <br/>Cards<br/>Put together your dream-team card deck before battle begins! Unlock and level up cards in PvP events; each has its own special strengths and weaknesses. Some combinations are more efficient than others, and the more you play, the better you get at lining them up.<br/> <br/>Arenas<br/>Arenas are grid-like maps where battles are waged. Their landscapes feature various combinations of ground, rock, and water, and your goal is to place your Towers and Barracks (the latter release walking and flying Troopers) on the map so as to destroy your enemy\u2019s assets\u2014while keeping yours.<br/>There are 3 Biomes that change an Arena\u2019s esthetic\u2014awesome visual skins, if you like.<br/> <br/>Chains<br/>Why Chain Wars? Now, the only way to make your strategy work is to connect all your assets to your Citadel via the Energy Chain: it activates their powers and keeps them running on a mix of magic and enthusiasm. Same for your opponent though! Do break up their Energy Chains to undermine their military might.<br/> <br/>Mana<br/>The cute lilac flame flickering above the Shrine is Mana: you need it to deploy your chosen Cards. Therefore, seizing a Shrine is an immediate advantage as you\u2019ll be stocking up on Mana faster.<br/> <br/>PvP: Ranked Mode<br/>Challenge other players on one of the 14 specially designed Arenas! Luckily, there are always a couple of Shrines to seize and enjoy mining Mana!<br/>- 2 players on a fixed map the size of your screen<br/>- Win to increase your personal ranking or lose to drop points<br/>- Progress along the Trophy Road with every win and unlock new Cards, Arena skins, and functional options<br/> <br/>PvE: Survival Mode<br/>Alternatively, play (not rage!) against the machine on large PvE Arenas with 50 to pick from! Your battlegrounds stretch way beyond your screen, so have fun exploring each Arena\u2019s multiple features.<br/>- Destroy enemy buildings and fend off waves of their Troopers to claim more and more grounds and grow your powers<br/>- Don\u2019t let the enemy get to your Citadel and destroy it: you\u2019re running on a timer, so stay focused!<br/>- As the Fog of War partially conceals your buildings and units, use it to your tactical advantage<br/> <br/>Just a thought: summon the Deadly Bats in different game modes and see how they work it.<br/> <br/>Chain Wars In Numbers<br/>- 7.5+ mln possible \u0421ard combinations<br/>- 14 PvP Arenas<br/>- 50 large Arenas for PvE battles<br/>- 3 Biomes (+2 more coming up!)<br/>- 10 Leagues of player awesomeness<br/><br/>Tap into the warrior inside you and seize the day with Chain Wars!
