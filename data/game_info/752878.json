This time,\u00a0I'd like to design a multiplayer roguelike\u00a0girls' last tour\u00a0fan game to support those fright for\u00a0Ukraine, I have finished the charsets,\u00a0but turn out to run out of my time in the last few days... To be honest, this is not even a prototype or\u00a0a proof of concept, but I think I should still submit it so that someone can find the potential of the EasyRPG multiplayer framework and help me to improve it in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by [REM9](https://vgperson.com/games/rem9.htm), but not just randomize the connection between rooms, we would prefer\u00a0to have a\u00a0complete experience of a classical roguelike game. But RM2k3 doesn't have a built-in script language inside the engine, right?\u00a0Although it is Turing-complete,\u00a0I must say\u00a0it is almost impossible to implement complex game logic using only common events. :(</p>\n<p>But RM2k3, in some sense, is\u00a0open source (with\u00a0https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player).</p>\n<p>You could modify the player code so that has CPP as a\u00a0scripting language in RM2k3!\u00a0This opens up a great deal of imagination. For example, you can use [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core) to run your game in a web browser, and implement some multiplayer game logic like what they do in\u00a0[ynoproject](https://github.com/ynoproject/). And of course, you can also\u00a0use [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/) to make your life easier when writing roguelike!</p>\r\n## About the multiplayer features\r\n<p>Press Tab to toggle the focus window between chat and game. You must have a nickname so that can call common events through messages. (e.g. generate a random map, shot other player, etcs)</p>\n<p>In order to maintain the original flavor of the Dream Diary series of games,\u00a0the originally [ynoproject](https://github.com/ynoproject/) didn't support execute common events across each client, so I modify lots of their code, now [my code](https://github.com/lychees/ynoclient) is in a mess, but can work in some sense.</p>\n<p>For example, you can actually shoot other players in the dream with your AK-47 if you want.</p>\n<br/>\r\n## About the gameplay\r\n<ul><li>[Demo](https://yno.yumenikki.info/?game=dungeon-of-the-last-tour)</li><li>[Source Code](https://github.com/lychees/Dungeon-of-the-Last-Tour)</li></ul>\n<p>This game is built on the top of\u00a0[Yumehazard](https://yumenikki.info/archives/yumehazard/).\u00a0(since it is a RM2k3 game, and has guns).</p>\n<p>There is a black cat inside your room, talk to it and you will teleport to a special dream, in this dream, you can play as Yuri or Chito, explore in a random maze generated with libtcod.<br/></p>\n<p>There are several hidden boxes inside the maze, find them and you will have free medel. Collect those medals you can upgrade existing weapons or buy new ones in Yumehazard more easily.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11afd97efebd3e7547fcea5294aed27c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MinakoKojima"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
