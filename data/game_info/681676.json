{"id": 681676, "slug": "catcher-in-the-rye-game", "name": "Catcher in the Rye Game", "name_original": "Catcher in the Rye Game", "description": "\"Catcher in the Rye\" School project game\u00a0\r\n\n<p>In this game, you play as Holden from \"Catcher in the Rye\". This game is inspired by a part in the book where Holden is talking to Phoebe and she asks him what makes him happy. He says that he would be happy if he could run around in a field of rye all day stopping kids from going over the cliff that is on one side of this field. The cliff represents a child losing their innocence. Holden stopping the kids represents Holden's drive to preserve kids' innocence. In this game, you stop the kids from going over the cliff (at the bottom of the screen). If any kids make it over or you fall off the cliff yourself then you lose. The objective is to try to catch as many kids as possible. Hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Built using the Tiny RPG Asset Pack from the Unity Asset Store.</p><p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/tiny-rpg-forest-114685</p>\n<strong>Key Pressed</strong><strong>Action</strong>W / up arrowmove forwardS / down arrowmove backwardA / left arrowmove leftD / right arrowmove right", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c758a095eaad59d51f2ae35325701e77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rpassmore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
