Levels will mostly involve reversing with your trailer and trying to avoid pylons. Then just adding some explosive barrels to the mix to keep up the pressure.</p>\n<p>The game works with both keyboard and gamepad, although I didn't set up the gamepad with any of the menus, so keep a mouse close by.</p>\n<p>I wish I could have added some more features but unfortunately, I wasted the first 6 hours of the Jam on a prototype I scrapped. Also in case, it isn't obvious I'm not a 3-D modeller, so try to look past the block cars lol.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, so I hope you like playing it as much as I enjoyed developing it!</p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think :)</p>\n<p>Shoelace.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to my wonderful girlfriend for testing the game.</p>\n<p>Music: March of the Spoons by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Engine &amp; Explosion\u00a0SFX: Provided by ProductionCrate.com</p>\n<p>Tween Library: Lean Tween</p>\n<p>Everything Else: Yours Truly</p>\n\r\nP.S.\u00a0<strong>Never Use the Unity Wheel Collider!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b5d837b0e00113f66c4d11884755d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shoelace"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
