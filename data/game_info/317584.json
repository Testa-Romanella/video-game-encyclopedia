You have been sent to retrieve a golden claw for a shopkeeper who lives in the town of Riverwood. The claw had been stolen by some bandits a few nights before. Once you retrieve the claw you must return to the shopkeeper to receive your reward.</p>\n<p>Note: The Golden Claw quest inspired me to make this game and I edited it slightly to make it more understandable and easier to tell in a text-based game. If you'd like more I would highly recommend playing the action RPG game The Elderscrolls V: Skyrim. It's one of my favorite videogames and would recommend it to anyone looking for adventure and questing. I do not own the music, character models, or environments expressed in this game. They are owned by Bethesda Softworks.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0created this game using Twine.
