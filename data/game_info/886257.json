There's a jump button! You might even learn a little something about what life is all about... fine footwear.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBOOTS QUEST is a fairly short game for players who just want to enjoy the story (~2-3 hours), but for players who want to complete all the quests and track down all the secrets, it could take a lot longer.
