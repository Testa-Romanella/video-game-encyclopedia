Defend him with your life by surviving rounds of enemy fighters to gain points and, most importantly, to discover the power of friendship from fighting for your monkey ally. Take caution though, the army doesn't surrender that easy so it may be a rough ride out there! Do you have what it takes to protect Kong\u2019s innocence from the power hungry dogs of the military?</strong></p>\n<p> <em>This game was made for the Ludum Dare Jam 46. This has been our first attempt for a game jam and we have all worked incredibly hard to produce this game for you to play. These are hard times we are living in right now and we hope that our goofy little game will bring a little bit of joy to you during all of this.
