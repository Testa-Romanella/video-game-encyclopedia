There are 3 maps on the game with increasing difficulty. When you clear the first 3 levels, the game starts over from the first map adding some wind effects on the balloon that will further increase the difficulty.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Put the joystick in port #2</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fire </strong>- make the balloon go up</li><li><strong>Left </strong>- move balloon to left</li><li><strong>Right</strong> - move balloon to right</li></ul>\n\n<p>The game was written in Assembly using Kick Assembler and Visual Studio Code.
