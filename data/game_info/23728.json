{"id": 23728, "slug": "windsoul", "name": "WindSoul", "name_original": "WindSoul", "description": "WindSoul - is a project dedicated to the revival of the gameplay of the classic strategic game for two participants of the \"Sea Battle\", in which players in turn indicate the coordinates on an unknown opponent's map. If the rival has a ship on these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is considered to be destroyed, and the striker gets the right to make one more turn. The player's goal is to first hit all enemy ships.<br/><br/>This project is the first public released on Steam for us. We change the familiar formula and the game concept by introducing our new rules and game modes that significantly transform the gameplay inside of it.<br/><br/><br/>Inside there are two versions of the game, each one represents a different gaming experience, the classic \"DOS-version\" and modern \"Remastered\".<br/><br/>The classic version offers you to play the game based on a special engine written by Turbo Pascal for launching from the DOS environment. Feel nostalgic for the 80-90s, when the games were pixelated, colorful and bright, and the gameplay is not so convoluted. This version has 2D sprite graphics with support of 256 colors. Among the game modes there is only a standard according to the classic rules (for now) for one and two players in the Hot-seat mode (turn-based).<br/><br/>In this version of the game, we use the full capabilities of the modern 3D engine to make the gameplay more interactive and exciting, and the strategic part is more visually saturated.<br/><br/>\"In the development process of the DOS version of the game we were restrained by a huge number of environmental restrictions, with which we could not do anything, then in this version our freedom is practically unlimited, and we can realize almost all our new ideas and game mechanics.\"<br/><br/>In addition to the mode with standard rules in this version there are also new ones that greatly change the gameplay and the strategic component of the game. Also in addition to this, the \"Global Campaign Mode\" is in development, which turns the game into a real-time strategy game with its economic system and rules: leveling up, fleet management, territory control and battles, all of this and much more awaits you in the \"Global Campaign Mode\"(also includes multiplayer). Do not forget that the game has now migrated to full 3D engine with beautiful animations and many other graphical innovations.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Instead of our own system of automatic distribution of cumulative updates called \"KaiZen\" Steam update content system came.<br/></li><li>A multiplayer games are available through the SteamWorks network services.<br/></li><li>Steam Cloud will help keep your profile data and saved games safe, synchronizing them with the cloud storage.<br/></li><li>Steam achievements, as well as collectible cards, exclusive icons, smileys, and backgrounds are available only in this version.</li></ul><br/><br/>We certainly plan to develop our project and follow the model of releasing big updates every month and small hotfixes every two weeks. Here is a short list of what we plan to add in the near future:<br/><ul><li>A flexible system of saving, which will allow you to start the game on a PC, and then easily continue the game on the Android tablet.<br/></li><li>First DLC with codename \"Oriental Manners\".<br/></li><li>The ability to self-customize the game content.</li></ul>CreditsGame Design, Code and Graphics: <strong>Alexey \"LexPest\"</strong>.<br/>Composer: <strong>Vincent Black OST</strong>.<br/>2017.
