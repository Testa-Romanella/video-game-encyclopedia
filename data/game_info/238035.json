Simply tap with your super sharp finger to keep a black or white color circle objects moving in the air and match black or white color target objects in order to cross through it. Cross through as many different types of target objects as you can before hitting into a different color than your circle. The best charm of the game is that the target objects are moving differently and the circle object is switching its color black or white randomly. Moving further to different levels, the target becomes more challenging utilizing different unique and tricky shapes. Moreover, the game may be simple but black or white colour switching circle objects randomly in the air makes game more addictive.The speed at which you tap the black or white color circle determines how fast or slow the circle moves up the smart screen. With every different switching movements, the geometry polygon objects and shapes all alters, so players has to constantly focus for the solution.<br/><br/>The minimalist and colorful design makes the game feel very unique and fresh. <br/><br/>The physics of the target objects are fun and surprising.
