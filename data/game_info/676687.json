A dragon has been found in a local cave that serves as a sanctuary to a critically endangered species of bats. For this, the dragon must be destroyed. You brew your dankest of brews - an explosively unstable concoction of black pepper, cilantro, and nitroglycerine. It's so dank you can't even hold it in your hands, so you summon a table to hold the potion. Go destroy the dragon, but don't drop the potion!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW to move left and right. Use Q and E to tilt the table. Hit SPACEBAR or click <em>Play</em> to begin.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Dankity Dank Games Inc., Incorporated</em></strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Joseph Mortensen - Programming and Sound Assets</li><li>Jacqueline Loerincs - Graphical Assets</li><li>John Luke Lusty - Programming and Sound Assets</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/deebad33d810717dcea7d30b9c4b39f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jllusty"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
