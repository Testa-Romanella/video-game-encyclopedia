In true street of shame style the erstwhile hack has to snoop around all the rooms looking for her. He must also find his equipment (a flash bulb) and a key for the open some door. If it wasn't enough you've got a deadline.\u00a0The game has 3 difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard. At each difficulty level, 7 levels must be completed to play through the game.
