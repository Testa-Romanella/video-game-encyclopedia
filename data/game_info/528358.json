This current version is an early access version due to it not currently having enough content.\u00a0Some things to say though. If you are connecting the battery to a solar panel put the solar panel on top of a HORIZANTOL battery. Batteries need to have the little square at the top touching the factory to energize it. Eflux is this games electricity. The Screwdriver can pin and unpin objects. And finally, theres a hidden Candy\u00a0factory :D<br/>Feel free to discuss glitches you find or cool new contraptions you make in our discussion board.<br/><br/>A new update is out! A devlog will be posted with the new how to get bullets, as well as a list of the new things!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75b/75b41f9ccc1a47a17708581efe1e6d17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Habetis Invalidum"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
