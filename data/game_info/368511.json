If you remember, this game used to be on Nokia mobiles. Yes, the old monochrome display ones. Me and my friend decided to revive this,\u00a0 as it was really successful back in it's time.\u00a0 The enemies come at you the exact way like on the old mobile version - at least we tried. The game is currently in alpha stage, you can play the first two levels. If you find any bugs, please let us know. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebee27b5d2d9f82ac343a6e5fba26191.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["warifari"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
