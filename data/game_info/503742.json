Gather \u2018round and I will tell you a story about Ax, Chel, and October in their quest to save their home. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting: in this story,\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0get to pick what happens!</p>\n<p>Kamishibai is a love-letter to JRPGs. Unfortunately, our eyes were too big for our stomach with this one. We wanted a full experience with between-battle visual-novel cutscenes, fully voiced intros, and enough eye candy to make the game truly pop. We were close to done, and a lot of the assets are finished, but we don\u2019t have the time to put it all together and playtest it to the extent it deserves. This submission is just the combat engine as a tech demo, but keep an eye on the page because we plan to develop this even more! Since you can\u2019t beat the game, I guess you\u2019re\u2026 stuck in a loop hahaha\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, please let us know!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Archie Reid </strong>- Designer, artist, composer, voice acting (Chel, October, Rocc, Slime)</li><li><strong>Finn Truman</strong> - Programming</li><li><strong>Aly \"AlyNotAllie\"</strong> - Voice acting (Ax, Slime)</li></ul>\n<p>Made in GameMaker: Studio 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4026cbd1c8af1a4bd8374149ee70a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["finnttruman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
