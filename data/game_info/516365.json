I make video games for fun. This is a project I made with my girlfriend. She did the pixelart and I the programming. It is part of a training we do right now to train for game jams. We made the version 0.1 in 15 hours and will work another 9 hours on another day for the boss enemy of the game. This is a short fun training project for gamejams. I will upload a full development video at somepoint and update the version. Love to you all &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T02:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db3292e71ab8fa6a2da2549591cb9b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boscoJones"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
