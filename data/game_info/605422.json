It is a large Interactive Fiction game which can be run either from Windows or in a DOS window. All files in the zipped folder (with the exception of the Read Me file) must be present for the game to run.</p>\n<p>Some of the puzzles and problems in this game are quite fiendish, and I would consider it to be very difficult. Unlike my later games it is possible to get yourself into an unwinnable situation, so regular saving of your position is recommended. Also, The parser, while still fairly comprehensive, is not quite as developed as it became in my later games.</p>\n<p>To get more information, type HELP within the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T10:04:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3e7d000ba594a5dd4c4b3d887590523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Older Timer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
