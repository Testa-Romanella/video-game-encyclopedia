People are required to pay a fee and then have the ability to choose an\u00a0escape room theme they would like to complete with a group of friends. Throughout these\u00a0rooms, people must solve unique puzzles with the hints they are given in each room in order to\u00a0progress to different rooms and inevitably escape (e.g. unlocking doors, finding hidden paths,\u00a0collecting items, decoding ciphers, etc.)</p>\n<p>There is also a timer that gradually goes down (in-person it is roughly around 50 minutes, in\u00a0Evadere it is 10 minutes). Once time runs out in an escape room, the player(s) lose and have\u00a0failed the escape room as a result.</p>\n<p>Contributors:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Alexander Dispenza (Gameplay programmer)\u00a0</p>\n<p>-John Annoya(Gameplay programmer)</p>\n<p>Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-dispenza-920226175/</p>\n<p>Github:https://github.com/CrescentLua/Capstone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a62b6f19c6a6c6f1d86873f1e3ead8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlexanderDispenza"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
