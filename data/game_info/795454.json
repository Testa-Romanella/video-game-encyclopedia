{"id": 795454, "slug": "dark-dimension", "name": "Dark Dimension", "name_original": "Dark Dimension", "description": "Dark Dimension is loosely inspired by the classics Resident Evil and Silent Hill. A man locked in a mansion faces the ineffable interdimensional-horror to try to get out. Resist insanity even paralyzed after a jump scare, try to aim precisely at that putrefying head, the demons' only weak point, as with each staggering step they approach you frighteningly\u2026 Without crosshair, you aim as if you were using a real gun, with a desperate reload delay and between shots. You see your chest, arms and legs, simulating a much more realistic and immersive POV movie. The subtle puzzles are natural with the dangerous environment, not forced. Enemies change their locations each game to maintain unpredictability, scares and replayability. Would you escape a more real survival horror?<br/><br/>If you buy it now, you'll get the game cheaper than the final release. But if you can't, you can add the game to your wish list to be informed when you have a new promotion. Thank you very much for your visit!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T04:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/96357ad5704e9852b72a3b6958e75805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heroic Hearts"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Heroic Hearts"], "esrb_rating": null}
