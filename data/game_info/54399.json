Fighters&#39; NEXTream (Generation of Arts, Speed and Power) is a fighting video game for the Nintendo 64 released in 1998. The story follows a series of fighters that have each received a mysterious letter to compete in a legendary contest, and about a champion that has disappeared. The American and Canadian versions are known as Deadly Arts, however the story, and the player&#39;s profiles with age and notes about the characters doesn&#39;t appear in the instructions for the North American version. Except for the name change it is basically the same as the Japan and Europe versions, with slightly changed voice messages, and different character&#39;s name plates. Despite its US title none of the characters actually die nor bleed, but use of choke holds and other animated violence earned it a Teen 13+ rating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T20:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bc/3bc4e135bca317d3d48ef087420ccb20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
