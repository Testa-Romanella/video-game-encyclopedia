It's nothing to panic over! Just folks coming into the park and getting lost, being underprepared to deal with the wilderness. I decided it was about time we addressed the issue, so we hired some more staff, like you, to keep an eye on things. Just get your to-do list finished every day, and respond if anyone pings the help phone. <br/>Stay safe, Ranger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Search, you'll play as a park ranger, patrolling the map for those in need of help. Most of the time, you'll complete menial tasks like taking out the garbage, cleaning cabins, and making supply runs for underprepared guests. On occasion, you'll track down a lost guest somewhere in the park.<br/><br/>This game contains the following features:<br/><ul><li> Jump scares<br/></li><li> Pixelated Blood<br/></li><li> Low poly stylized graphics<br/></li><li> First person camera and controls<br/></li><li> Collectibles <br/></li><li> Clearly laid out objectives<br/></li><li> Very low intensity combat <br/></li><li> Auto saves</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T02:48:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b2b9ed118f7e35719f12b19c2e2392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ahmad R.H.", "ParsonsGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ahmad R.H.", "ParsonsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
