You press the attack button to initiate a sequence where you press either the 'z' or 'x' key to deal damage. The one with the sword, a.k.a swordog, uses 'z', and the magician, a.k.a, magidog, uses 'x'. You use these keys to block attacks from the enemy when they are attacking.</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by the <em>Mario and Luigi</em> series.
