Lose  yourself in the world of Maive\u2019s magic book by playing as the\u00a0characters  on her pages, and discover why she left, how she became a storyteller,  and\u00a0the courage it takes for her to finally come home.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Maive - Prologue </strong>was created for our final year  university project. Our small team of 3\u00a0worked hard on the game for as many  months as we had. But we couldn't seem to leave Maive behind once we'd  graduated. She, and her story, deserved more time than we were able to  give as students. So we wrapped up what we are now calling the  \"prologue\" - a proof of concept for an idea that we have since  dismantled and are building from the ground up.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T11:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc62a4a9bbf57b9f036b5d77a15f0376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["\u2728 Sid \u2728"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
