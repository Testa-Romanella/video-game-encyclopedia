A maze is a path or series of paths that leads from one point to another, usually from an entrance to a goal. Basically, the purpose of this game is to get from the start point to the end point by taking the correct paths. To complete the goal, the player must maneuver the character in the center of the screen onto the correct path. Movement, collision, and distance traveled are some of the basic aspects. Power up items (the screen will be 'zoomed out' and the camera position will be adjusted from the above so the player can see the map more clearly) are among the additional features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/165f3d7e022a024467d600c910a4d6d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NothingToSayy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
