It's a surprise to many that we Finns have mastered our dart throwing skills and are unquestionably the greatest dart throwers in the world. We Finns have played our dart game little differently than the rest of the world, but that's just because hundreds of years ago we didn't know how to count beyond 10.<br/><br/>The main reason behind releasing Finnish Dart Game was to bring a traditional darts game onto mobile devices. The other reason was to prove the world that Finns are the greatest dart throwers in the world - and we challenge you to prove otherwise!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3fcd05854fbfa95c6142ee774c4fb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jani Paakala"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Jani Paakala"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
