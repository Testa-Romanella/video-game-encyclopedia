Using the Unity game engine and assets such as Sunny Land and Warped Caves, I developed a game that pays homage to a beloved childhood character with its choice of background music, Sonic: After the Sequel. The result is a nostalgicically charged game that is sure to bring back memories for players of all ages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b711a204e96046e21b05d659286af702.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoaoNoronha"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
