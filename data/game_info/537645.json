I would be glad if you can give it a try and leave some feedback and rate it (button top right). It is a 2.5D explorative motocross racing game with loot and physics puzzles.<br/></p>\n<p>Here are some pictures:<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>If you want to know more about me and my games here is my website:<br/>https://airborne.kamgam.com<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Here is my marketing pitch (which I would love to get feedback on as well):</p>\n<p>----------<br/><em>Explore to find items. Fly with your bike. Race other players. Solve puzzles.<br/>Delve into the levels to relax or race others to get excited. Find items like a hang glider and solve some (optional) physics puzzles along the way.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>Airborne Motocross features some unusual mechanics and items. For example once you have got the hang glider you will spend a lot of your time in the air, especially after you have found the nitro booster.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Exploration (work-in-progress):</strong><br/>Combining items to reach new spots in the levels is at the heart of the game. Use them to overcome obstacles, unlock new areas and eventually, find new items.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Racing (work-in-progress):</strong><br/>Global highscores, clans, tournaments, pvp. You will find all these familiar features to make you feel at home. But there are some odd challenges too, like getting a huge ball into the goal as quickly as you can (rocket league anyone?).</em></p>\n<p><em>Use the items to speed up your times in the PvP races. But don't make the mistake of thinking there is no skill involved. To make it to the very top of the player charts you'll need to get good.</em><br/>---------</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your feedback.<br/>Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d751e74209cc4a101008860d1f13b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["kamgam"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
