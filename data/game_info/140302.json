{"id": 140302, "slug": "dungeonis", "name": "Dungeonis", "name_original": "Dungeonis", "description": "Some of the cast! left to right: vampire knight Claire, half demon Mira, Ryss the Werewolf, Grimlord Varyl.\r\n<p>Dungeonis is a challenging dungeon crawler with some story elements. It is created with unity and most models are my own. The short version of the story is this: Mira is searching for her father who went missing. He left her with a headband that conceals her half demon heritage which is a good thing because the townsfolk would never trust a demon outside the walls. However, Mira has no real plan other than to investigate the ruins, and to do that she needs to become an official Ruins Investigation Agent. Then she can work up the ranks and freely search for her lost father while making a living for herself... win win right?</p>\n<p>currently the build is in a demo stage and has a mostly empty town and a couple dungeon levels. However, gameplay should be pretty stable.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/730dade67b4a3522969a96683ed25878.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dracon85"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
