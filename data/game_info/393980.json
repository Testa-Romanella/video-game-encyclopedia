The idea of this game is to collect the coins to advance to the next stage (there are no different stages at the moment). There are moving platforms that you can ride on to get around, but be careful to not go out of bounds. The boundary shrinks as you collect more coins. Use the arrow keys to move, \"z\" to jump and hover, and \"x\" to fall slower for a short time.\u00a0 The code (I am no professional) for this is open and free to download.</p>\n<p>*double click the game screen to activate the controls*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a39/a3912dfe2983e3dfc6af59746d895dd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zachary Goldsmith"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
