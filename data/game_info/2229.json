And there will be plenty of THOSE too \u2013 Achievements, Challenges and Collectables to hunt down, that\u2019ll keep the whole family entertained for hour upon happy blood and oil splattered hour.<br />\nThe game features:<br />\nSingle Player Career mode<br />\nFreeplay mode<br />\nOnline &amp; Offline Multiplayer mode<br />\nCarMODgeddon mods mode<br />\nThe Car Is The Star! Carmageddon: Max Damage features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive \u201ccharacter\u201d. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand \u2013 wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it\u2019s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents\u2019 and your own car \u2013 smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and today we take this to a whole new level!  Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades are available for your car, along with other customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your rides.<br />\nA host of old favourites from the original Carmageddon make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory \u2013 usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!<br />\nThe new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. \u201cBleak City\u201d, &quot;Devil&#39;s Canyon&quot;, \u201cDusty Trails\u201d, \u201cMagNuChem\u201d and &quot;Snowy&quot; levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop \u2019de\u2019 Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we\u2019ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!<br />\nThe topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. \u201cNice Shot Sir!\u201d And talking of pedestrians\u2026<br />\nOnce again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species. Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry \u201cI was in the war!\u201d, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces \u2013 including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!<br />\nPowerUps are back and this time they\u2019re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos &amp; Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like &quot;Pelvic Thrust&quot; and a variety under the heading \u201cTossers\u201d! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin\u2019 Helium Filled Peds, or Peds without legs at a Temporary Rapture!<br />\nLeaderboards. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard using skill or brute force!<br />\nAchievements. A suitably warped array of mad Feats and Exploits will garner you the rewards that every gamer dreams of.<br />\nChallenges: Do the most stupid things, collect meaningless trinkets and waste hours of your life in the pursuit of ultimately pointless goals!<br />\nSmelly Bushes: We\u2019ve hidden a variety of these specially fragrant Easter Eggs throughout the game to keep you busy and entertained!<br />\nCarMODgeddon: The whole game is MODdable for your MODding pleasure!<br />\nCheck out the official Carmageddon comic series!
