If anyone asks us why we decided to make our first game based on such dark and matured topics when we could have made something simple and lightweight, the reason was no brainer.<br/><br/>The main reason we decided to take this road was based on the question why many of us play video games in the first place? For a lot of players, video games offer an alternative to cope with depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems (Contrary to popular beliefs of course?). Also, according to reports, 46% of teenagers suffer from mental health-related issues and it is estimated that Eight hundred thousand people die due to suicide every year. (WHO - September 2019)<br/><br/>Our goal while creating Forgotten Hope was to increase mental health awareness because mental health affects everyone differently and recognizing when to get help yourself or offer support to someone else is a crucial step in changing those statistics for the better. ~ Black Hammer Studios \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddf0", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T04:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/325efdc86ce1285d42e78760a00b9649.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/forgottenhopegame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Hammer Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Hammer Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
