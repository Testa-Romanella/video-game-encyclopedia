{"id": 906443, "slug": "crop-carnage", "name": "Crop Carnage", "name_original": "Crop Carnage", "description": "<p>Crop Carnage is a base-defense style shooter, with a twist. Your crops and your guns are the same thing! Plant new crops to keep a continuous supply of ammunition, but don\u2019t replant your entire yield, or you\u2019ll only have your scythe to defend yourself with! With three different crops to grow, and three different weapons to wield, how long will you be able to defend your farm from the hordes of zombies lurking in the forest?</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for Ludem Dare 52.<br/>There's a weird bug if you go to the credits *after* going to the \"how to play\" screen or playing the game. Everything breaks, I don't know if it's my fault or Godot's, but just reload and it should work fine? This problem only exists in the browser version of the game, so feel free to download for Windows, Mac OS, or Linux!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b75a51a4955985f0eb758aeec468764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["manchmalscott"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
