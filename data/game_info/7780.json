They farmed their loved flowers, which they ate with great appetite.<br/><br/>But that was then, before the monsters came. Now they are neurotic and constantly chased by the soot-lump creatures who love Pebble-meat more than anything else. And the monsters have a great advantage. With their great horror instil xray-eye, they see through the Pebbles stone camouflage, and they can't protect themselves against attacks. Until now! <br/><br/>The Pebbles discovered that their hats explode when they smash into each other at high speed. Suddenly they had a weapon to defend themselves. Now they can finally fight back. And they need your help.<br/><br/>Are your timing skills good enough to save the Pebbles? <br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>&lt;3 Thank you for playing Pebble Universe!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T03:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4636f82b60e52c9aeaa4f79eee17b1.jpeg", "website": "http://pebbleuniverse.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Itatake.com"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Itatake"], "esrb_rating": null}
