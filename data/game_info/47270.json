In the face of the destruction of an entire civilization and life on the planet, warring parties decided to call a truce and tried to repair the damage. For that, however, was already too late. Using all the remaining magic resources to cast a powerful spell, they managed to keep their world in a relative balance. <br/><br/>Many dark ages have passed, but when all seemed lost, a spark of hope shined once again: new sources of magic appeared and the whole planet began to give birth to new mages. Now, the rediscovered power can either restore Driftland to its former glory or devastate what's left of the planet, when the old conflict inevitably returns.<br/><br/>You take the role of a Mage Overlord with your own castle, tower, and a small realm on one of the islands. With your unique powers, you can explore a procedurally generated world and connect floating islands, expand your increasing kingdom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay focuses on setting general goals for all the units, without the need for micromanaging each one of them. Under your command, warriors, archers and mages are able to tame and ride different types of flying beasts, creating various aerial units.<br/><br/><ul><li> procedurally generated world<br/></li><li> resources and magic based economy<br/></li><li> move and terraform scattered islands by magic<br/></li><li> tame and ride dragons and other creatures<br/></li><li> explore and fight on the same map<br/></li><li> set goals instead of directly control units<br/></li><li> single player campaign and multiplayer</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-10T21:50:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/6641780de3a7f6c4bd93b73042b5ca91.jpg", "website": "http://www.driftlandthegame.com", "rating": 2.93, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 87, "owned": 1284, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Star Drifters"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Star Drifters"], "esrb_rating": null}
