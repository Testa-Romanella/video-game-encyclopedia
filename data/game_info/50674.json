{"id": 50674, "slug": "battlesky-vr", "name": "BattleSky VR", "name_original": "BattleSky VR", "description": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)BattleSky VR is a <strong>Multiplayer VR game</strong> at its core, bringing <strong>MOBA</strong> style gameplay to the VR platform.  Each player picks a Hero with vastly different size, powers and gameplay style to engage in fast-paced aerial combats against other players.  Play online against other players with classic Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and other teamplay modes of up to 4v4 players!  Pick your Heroes wisely, your unique powers will determine gameplay strategies as you team up to defeat the opponents!Single Player Mission ModeEach Hero has a single player mission mode where you'll learn the back story about the Heroes, and get familiar with the controls and the unique Flying Locomotion.Unique VR LocomotionEach Hero uses a completely different flying locomotion mechanism, giving you a wide range of aerial experiences in this game.  We have tested our flying locomotion mechanisms with over 500 testers, and found that less than 10% of the testers had experienced motion sickness.  And out of this 10%, most of them only experienced motion sickness with one of the Heroes, and not with the other hero (roughly half of the 10% only experienced motion sickness with Draco, and the other half only experienced motion sickness with Jet-9.  A very small percentage experienced motion sickness with both Heroes).  So you will be sure to find a Hero that fits your gameplay style!Which Hero do you want to be?At beginning of early Access, two Heroes will be accessible: <strong>Draco</strong>, and <strong>Jet-9</strong>.  The third Hero is <strong>Lady V</strong>, and it is being developed.  Will you flap your wings to soar through the sky as <strong>Draco</strong>? Or, zoom through the sky with the hand thrusters as <strong>Jet-9</strong>? As we develop the game further during Early Access, we look forward to YOUR feedback and suggestions as we add more Heroes, each with unique flying and battle capabilities.Early AccessWe want to engage the gaming community during Early Access and continue to add more Heroes, Maps, and Gameplay Modes as we develop the game continuously.
