Hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Dungeon Dweller is a story-driven physics-based puzzle platformer. It revolves around an archaeologist named Sara who falls through a hole in the ground after a cave-in and ends up at the entrance to a dungeon, in which strange writings on the walls guide her out. Along the way, you'll find Sara's logs explaining the story and setting.</p>\n<p>Once this project is done we plan on releasing it for $4. This is a very small demo just intended to show off the gameplay and concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d5aef1db0d89bd4851f445894daf9b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ph4370n"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
