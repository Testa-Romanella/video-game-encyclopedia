These corporal punishments aim to purify the faithful through pain in order to open the doors of the Shimmering Fields to them. The sect always operates in the same way: one of these members strips naked and begins his path of atonement in a remote town or village. He will invariably head for Galgenbeck, enjoining others to join him in this deadly pilgrimage. Rules and background to introduce the sect into your MB journey.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Flagellants is an independent production by Olivier Delattre and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Gamesor Stockholm Kartell.
