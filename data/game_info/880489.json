I decided it was in dire need of a mini-game and ended up with <em><strong>Spectrobes: Brawl.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Control <strong><em>Spikan</em></strong>, the wrecking-ball-tailed monster, as you defend against ever-oncoming waves of <strong><em>Krawl</em></strong>,\u00a0creatures of darkness. This 3D arcade-style beat-em-up aims to give you a quick session of good old-fashioned browser-based brawling as you try to beat your high-score.</p>\n<p>This game was made in a month for personal fulfillment. If it is received well, it may be updated with more content in the future.</p>\n<p>Downloadable PC version coming soon.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>3D real-time brawling<br/></strong>Based on the combat from the Nintendo-DS Spectrobes titles, this monster-battler lets you control Spikan in real-time and battle monsters based on timing, reflexes, and 3D movement. Dodge and demolish!</li><li><strong>Many monsters<br/></strong>Dozens of different Krawl with completely different attacks will come at you during the waves. Learn the attack styles of different species to out-maneuver them!</li><li><strong>Simple controls<br/>\n</strong>Designed to be an easily-accessible browser game, the controls were kept very simple. With only 2 attacks, a dash, and a burst, you can focus on the action with a regular\u00a0keyboard and\u00a0mouse.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Rampage!<br/>\n</strong>Special attacks charge up to turn the tide of battle, and when that's not enough,\u00a0<em>Evolve\u00a0</em>Spikan into the invincible Spikanor to mow down enemies!\r\n</li><li><strong>No hassle</strong><br/>\r\nPlay the entire game in-browser.
