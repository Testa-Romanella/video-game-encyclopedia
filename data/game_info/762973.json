Every so often, someone comes in from another world, typically with unresolved baggage from their past life.\r\n<br/><br/>With little idea of what can be done, and with everyone sharing the same story of how they got here, life has grown calm, if unremarkable, for these former adventurers.\r\n<br/><br/>That is, until you came along.\r\n\n\n<p>A pseudo-canonical Isekai visual novel about finding happiness even when it feels like life lacks direction or purpose.</p>\n<p>I wanted to immortalize the various D&amp;D characters I've made over the years, knowing fully I won't be reusing a lot of them in other projects. Thus, Peaceful&amp;Purgatory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was originally intended to be a webcomic, but I thought it best to instead write it stream-of-consciousness style instead of constantly fretting over the details. It's sure going to be messy, but I hope it's earnestness\u00a0shows as well.</p>\n<p>You may see some of these characters in different forms in different projects of mine\u00a0years from now, with different backstories or even designs, but for now, here's them as I remember them.</p>\r\nfeatures:\r\n<ul><li>5300+ words and counting</li><li>Characters from the 3+ years I've spent playing D&amp;D, drawn purposely by memory</li><li>At least three of them are cats</li><li>You can date them, if you want</li><li>Multiple routes,\u00a0variations and endings, depending on player choices</li><li>Self-indulgence</li></ul>\r\nplease read before playing.\r\n<p>Peaceful&amp;Purgatory is currently in active development, and thus is not yet playable to completion. As mentioned above, this is being written with minimal planning and thus elements therein are subject to change (I'm learning ren'py as I produce the game, in fact).\u00a0Think of it like I'm writing fanfiction for my own characters here.</p>\n<p>The game is currently playable up to the end of the first day, with some major and minor\u00a0variations depending on player choice. Hope you enjoy it. Or don't, I'm not your parental figure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T19:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d47e8221a671235061278fcf3c68afba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anpu Camilla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
