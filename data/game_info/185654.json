Fly, shoot, dodge missiles, die. Use arrow keys to turn, and Z to fire. Turning is slower while firing, which gives greater accuracy.</p><p>If you or your enemy dies, nothing happens. Restart the game! Also, damage calculations are not really working right. This is just all about flying around.</p><p>I've been toying with the idea of adapting the concept for mobile devices, and making some kind of space exploration and trading game, but nothing concrete has been done for that.</p><p>(This is also an experiment in using OpenGL ES 2.0 as a cross-platform 3D API. With libraries like ANGLE, it is quite easy to get it running on Windows, without even requiring OpenGL drivers to be installed.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/9388e2aa1c8bd760eaafa013eb3ec52a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dag \u00c5gren"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
