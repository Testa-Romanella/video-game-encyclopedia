Ciphers aren&#39;t a thing here, and local shoddy mystical beliefs are really irritating and dejecting to Roui. He dreams to return to his old life... But how can it be possible if you have no money? In search of quick earnings, Roui has picked up his old jewelry tools once more and seeks out customers himself. Roui\u2019s latest customer has charged him with a task to make a bracelet from a special wood for his bride \u2013 due within a month! But, as soon as Roui gets to work, strange and unpleasant things start to appear. Which, due to the superstitions of the local people, became much more horrific and absurd than they actually are. Roui apparently isn&#39;t meant to finish the work on the bracelet... because it was stolen! An unexpected helper says that the bracelet was taken by the legendary Latorian spirit - the Mad Rook. Is the Rook real or is it just her sick imagination? Roui has no time to figure out the details - he has to believe the helper and start looking for the bracelet as soon as possible, all while incidentally deciphering the mysterious cryptograms he&#39;ll be facing along the way.<br />\nWill Roui succeed and get the bracelet back? And what&#39;s waiting for him at the end of his long and full of mystical riddles journey?SettingWhere is it set?<br />\nThe setting is a fictional world called Shang-La, a world of mixed cultures and eras, and home to various strange creatures. This is a place of old magic and new ideas, where science works together with mysticism. You can find glasses and phones, electricity and radio here, but no guns or television. The inhabitants of this world still fight with swords. The continent they live in is surrounded by the boundless ocean. The Sun and the Moon take turns alternating in the sky, and the stars are made of metal and hiding tons of secrets in them.<br />\nWho are the Sahash?<br />\nSahash are the second intelligent race in Shang-La, alongside humans. They are divided into five nations, differing from each other by their physicality, shape of their horns, and muzzles. Every nation has its own unique traditions and culture: ranging from habits, religion, law, and even tastes in fashion and food.<br />\nDespite the complicated relationships between these ethnic groups of Sahash, as a whole they get along with humankind, and even try to emulate them in spite of their more animalistic nature.Key featuresPlaying our game, you will be able to:<br />\nCommunicate with multiple characters, forge friendships, and make bitter enemies.
