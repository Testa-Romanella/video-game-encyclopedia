{"id": 170179, "slug": "endless-arena", "name": "Endless Arena", "name_original": "Endless Arena", "description": "<p>Endless Arena is a mysterious place full of AngryGuys\u2122 who really want to kill you. They will keep spawning, forever and forever, and the more you kill them, the faster they spawn. How long can you survive?</p>\n\n\n<p>I have updated the game to version 2.5, where enemies shoot projectiles instead of hitscan, rocket launcher damage radius is bigger and hud flashes when the player is hit. Enemies only fire at you if you're in their line of sight, too. There's also background music made by my friend Lotus! <br/></p>\n<p> I doubt I will update this game further, since I'm making another FPS with bigger levels and that sort of thing. This game provides a base for that game however and I'm gonna use some of the same mechanics. You could think this is sort of demo, but not quite.<br/></p>\n<p>Originally I made this game for Alakajam 3 gamejam and it took me around ~36h. The theme was \"Always growing.\" I wondered how I could make this work in FPS, so I just kept it simple: <em>The number of enemies keeps growing and growing!</em><strong><em> </em></strong>If you want to play this version of the game, download the old \"Gamejam edition.\"</p>\n<p>Hopefully you'll like it!</p>\n<p>Also, if you like the game and/or have any feedback, join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/PZkYZRx<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>WASD -moving</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel or number keys 1 2 3 -Switch weapon<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse -look and shoot</p>\n<p>Space -jump</p>\n<p>Ctrl -crouch</p>\n<p>Alt+f4 -quit game<br/></p>\n<p>Run around the map collecting pickups and avoid going too close to the enemies, or they'll shoot you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has bunnyhopping and walljumping: You have to jump the moment you hit the ground to gain more speed. There's no upper cap, so you can go super fast, and the enemies can't hit you that well if you go faster. Walljumping works by going against wall and jumping in air. You can walljump three times before falling down.</p>\n<p><strong>Protip: Bunnyhopping makes the bullets easier to dodge!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Every ten kills you get, the spawning rate gets faster. The fastest it can get is spawning a new enemy every 0,5 seconds. It should get chaotic rather quick!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/882/8820adcfc568b09a4e67b28e9f32eec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akselmo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
