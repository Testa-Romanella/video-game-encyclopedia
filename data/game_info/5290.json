{"id": 5290, "slug": "fat-princess", "name": "Fat Princess", "name_original": "Fat Princess", "description": "<p>Frantic and fun, Fat Princess pits two hordes of players against each other in comic medieval battle royale. The player&#39;s goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her with the cake that grows in a nearby forest to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it&#39;s going to take most of your army working together to carry her back across the battlefield. Luckily, Fat Princess supports up to 32 players online simultaneously so plenty of help is available. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess, one of the PlayStation Network&#39;s most anticipated titles ever, as players can switch between five different character classes literally at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it&#39;s flinging another player over the enemy&#39;s walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding your muscle to carry the princess faster.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2009-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8ff/8ffe21d043312b43eb7ab3e2a2b26b8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 374, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 54, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 78, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Tritan Studios", "Titan Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["SCEA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
