Use it to practice different strategies and grow your bankroll.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game uses 8 decks of 52 cards each. The first card is removed and depending on its value, an additional number of cards are removed from the deck. The cut card is placed 75% into the deck after which the game is over and the cards are reshuffled. This is the way Baccarat is played in real life so that is the way it is done here. <br/></p>\n<p>There are 3 scorecards, the red and blue circles marking a player or banker win, that can be used to track results and work different strategies.
