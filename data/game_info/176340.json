You click the top of the\u00a0deck to draw a card<br/>2. You throw the card towards the\u00a0face down cards<br/>3. When/if it hits one of those cards, it'll have a different reaction.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0If your card is lower, it'll\u00a0stack.\u00a0(Stacking a 0 will remove the entire\u00a0stack)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0If your card is equal, it'll remove both cards<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0But if your card is greater, the cards will all fall back to the table<br/>4. You can grab cards that are falling back (but you can only hold 1 card at a time!)<br/>5. You'll lose if too many cards fall off the table<br/>6. And you'll win if all cards are successfully hit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d521b70729d4744fc7982851e54825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
