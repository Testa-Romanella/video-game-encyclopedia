A few hundred years ago this world had an advanced technology , but 300 years ago a nuclear war has taken place that tipped the world in a medieval era.</p>\n<p>Then, the world was divised into some twenty realms and now swords rub shoulders with wizardry and pre-war weapons like revolvers and laser beam weapons.</p>\n<p>Most of people had to live cloistered in cities because of mutants : Those are humans having undergone high radiation doses and they mutated into soulless bloodthirsty creatures.</p>\n<p>In recent years, scientists tried to control and improve pre-war quantum techniques in order to discover new life form. Thanks to the development of Reality Rippers they opened portals on other universes and they met indeed new life forms but...they were...very hostile.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, scientists were unable to control these interdimensional portals and breaches began to appear\u00a0throughout the world by letting in monsters and demons from other universes. Furthermore, a virus from one of these universes spread over the Lands of Aty and it turned\u00a0people into lobotomized zombies\u00a0that might contaminate others...</p>\n<p><strong>And then the bells rang the Apocalypse...That's where you come in !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0cf9e404a00478be01796710723bd3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atygeek"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
