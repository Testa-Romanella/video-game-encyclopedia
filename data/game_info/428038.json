You\u2019ll have a chance to change you deck before each fight. Different encounters may require you to change and adapt your strategy before taking on a creature or guardian. Quickly switching out Bleed cards in favour of Strength gain could be the difference between victory, or an agonising defeat.<br />\nThe more you play, the more you\u2019ll learn about each mob group, and which deck type would be best suited to handle the challenge ahead.Customise your CardsOne of the most unique features in Vault of the Void is the ability to customise your cards. You\u2019ll gather Void Stones as you progress through a run, and have the ability to socket them into any card in your library, giving them extra abilities.<br />\nTake the humble Master Slash for example, which will deal 5 damage. Taking a Yellow Void Stone will now also grant you 2 Block. Or maybe a Blue Void Stone, which now gives it the added ability of &quot;Draw a Card&quot;. There&#39;s hundreds of variations to try out, and how each of these interact with each other is part of the fun (and learning) that comes as you play.<br />\nBut that&#39;s not all! The variations continue, as all cards have the ability evolve into more dynamic and powerful versions! Turn any humble card into potent backbones of your strategy that are only further enhanced with those precious Void Stones you collect.Fast paced combatVault of the Void offers card fights that are fast paced and familiar, with some subtle unique changes.<br />\nAlthough you\u2019ll regain some energy at the start of each turn, Purging cards gives you the final decision on which cards you should play, and which you should sacrifice to setup for later turns.<br />\nAs creatures attack during their turn, they\u2019ll increase your Threat. At the end of your next turn, your Threat stack will trigger, dealing damage to your hit points equal to its total value. Play Block cards to reduce your Threat reactively, and make the hard choice between damage, or survival.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-04T01:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1e6a5bb30ff067bd9b34ef46d790e27.jpg", "website": "http://www.vaultofthevoid.com", "rating": 4.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 122, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 167, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spider Nest Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spider Nest Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
