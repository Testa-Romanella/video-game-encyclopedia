Restarting the game is a workaround as progress is automatically saved every level.</li>\n<li>Rarely, when loading existing solutions, the last step will be skipped, but its cost will still be deducted. Usually, this will result in a $200 increase in budget compared to the solution's supposed cost. It's not currently clear which kind of situations will lead to this issue. This can be worked around in smaller levels by resetting and manually rebuilding the solution.</li>\n<li>Some pipe colors may be difficult to differentiate for players with alternate color vision. The shortcuts 1/2/3/4 can be used to locate pipe endings of the same color as a workaround.</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits\r\nStaff\r\n<ul>\n<li>Gameplay / Level Design: Aemetta</li>\n<li>Stylistic Direction / UI: toasteater</li>\n<li>3D: Aemetta</li>\n<li>Music / Sound Effects: toasteater</li>\n<li>Writing: toasteater</li>\n</ul>\r\nExternal assets\r\n<ul>\n<li>M+ FONTS by M+ FONTS PROJECT.
