Each level presents a new challenge, with different enemy types and numbers, and you must strategically place your towers to best defend your base.<br/>There are five different types of towers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. You must carefully choose which towers to use in each level, as using the wrong ones can quickly lead to defeat.<br/>The game is not easy, but it is immensely satisfying to beat a level that you thought was impossible.<br/>If you are looking for a fun and challenging tower defense game, with endless replay value, then look no further than my game. Give it a try, and see if you can defend your base from the hordes of enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T11:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/319adaa61ffe4e2c577cebeeb6651b60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CalzarStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
