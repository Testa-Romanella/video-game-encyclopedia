Take out enemies to rack up as much score as possible. Collect health pickups and score multipliers that randomly spawn as you play. The catch is that as you destroy enemies you don't gain, but instead lose experience. As you level down your stats decrease making it increasingly difficult to survive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c70ed44abf3f93f264dd0915af258b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Searcy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
