The only thing you control is the box's color, switching to black for as long as you are tapping. Because you can only pass obstacles if they are the same color as you. As soon as a black little box comes up next, tap the screen until you passed it. This game is simple, dynamic and easy to learn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T03:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/def/def7e1d07b53409ff2e02cf97d6296a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Edwin Chavesta"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Edwin Chavesta"], "esrb_rating": null}
