No sweat though, your vehicle has the perfect speed to pass through - with a bit of finesse, you will be fine and not fall off.<br/><br/>DOZENS OF HI-TECH PROTOTYPES TO RIDE<br/>Collect dozens of unique racing vehicles with futuristic designs. Unlock new bikes by completing tasks, beating challenges or breaking track records: there\u2019s always a new objective and a new reward to look forward to. From trials bikes to ATVs, WW2 era motorbikes to space rockets, they\u2019re all in there.<br/><br/>NO GRINDING<br/>Here\u2019s a list of what you won\u2019t find in Gravity Rider Zero:<br/>- No overpriced upgrade parts<br/>- No grinding<br/>- No tickets<br/>- No time gates<br/>- No difficulty spikes<br/>- No artificial difficulty <br/>- No limited garage space. <br/><br/>WHAT YOU WANT, WHERE YOU WANT<br/>You can unlock all the racing cars and bikes you want. You can dash on your moto, mmx buggy or quad whenever you want. You can speed with them on any track you want - their stats are always perfectly balanced for the race you\u2019re in. Yep, no secret ultimate cheat bike, no special wheels of doom - here, all motorcycles are good.<br/><br/>IT\u2019S ALL YOU<br/>The controls in Gravity Rider Zero are simple and precise. Accelerate and tilt your bike in the right places to pass over obstacles faster. Brake in time to avoid traps. Always tilt after a jump to touch the ground earlier and gain more traction. Brake before a jump to minimize your air time, try and try again. <br/>Or, just focus on making sure you pass obstacles, don\u2019t crash and beat the level. Bike racing is a customizable experience: you decide how deep you want the mechanics to be.<br/><br/>FULL CAREER MODE<br/>Enjoy a classic solo career progression system: you get enough lives to clear 3 stages and then move onto the next world. Each new world features a new gimmick, and you will see a planets\u2019 load of environments. That\u2019s not an image: you will literally travel from planet to planet to face the craziest tracks in the universe. Oh and of course, your vehicle stats will increase along the way: it\u2019s all balanced, but you will get faster.<br/><br/>COLLECT AND CUSTOMIZE <br/>Admire and customize your vehicle collection. Give your race car a new paint job, give your motorbike a different color, or upgrade your kart with a neon lights trail. Even if your motorcycle is always perfectly tuned, that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot upgrade your style!<br/><br/>JUST CHILL <br/>Gravity Rider Zero is all about two things: getting cool rides, and pure racing. That\u2019s how we do things here, in the career mode. We focus on what matters, and to heck with the fluff. You want to optimize your turns, race against the clock, get the best time? You can.<br/>You want to take your time getting through creative levels? You can too.<br/><br/>Just enjoy the ride and pop a wheelie. :)<br/><br/>Got a question?
