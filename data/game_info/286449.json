In high school I played a mobile game called Galcon, itself an indie game made by one person. Over the Christmas break I wanted to make another small project and decided to try my hands at cloning that game. The premise is simple: conquer territories to increase your numbers so that you can conquer more territories to increase your numbers so that... again and again until you're the last one standing!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay is also incredibly simple. Click on your territories (the green ones) to select them, then click on an enemy's territory to attack. Or you can click and drag to select as well as target, and this lets you target your own territories to send reinforcements. In the bottom right corner you'll see a little half-circle button next to the pause button, this lets you toggle between 4 settings for what fraction of a territory's units are sent when attacking: 50%, 75%, 100% and 25%. Territories generate units at rates determined by their size, with larger ones producing units faster. But be careful as they're also a bigger target!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:21:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b51c2b73354253b08dc6ead9ef72a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Attic Muse"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
