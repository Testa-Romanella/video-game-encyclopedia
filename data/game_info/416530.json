LW Creations on Twitter) , I'd</em>\u00a0love too see it working on a real cabinet.</p>\n<p>Currently in version 1.10 it only has\u00a0keyboard controls but I aim to add game pad in a future update, I've added fruit pickups that randomly appear as well as extra time pickups, four baddies that are quite dumb and sometimes even get stuck and 2 player at the same time.</p>\n<p>It also\u00a0saves high scores but it doesn't currently allow name entry as I had some issues implementing a name entry without it having to be typed with the keyboard.</p>\n<p>I am also making some bonus content to go along with the game including a small digital owner manual, these will be optional downloads should you want them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:00:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/380ee669cb29aaa148597758b07c0d2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leighton Williams"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
