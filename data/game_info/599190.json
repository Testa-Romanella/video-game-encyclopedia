By clicking the  \u201cGenerate Recipe\u201d button, a random cake recipe will generate. Next, the  user will add cake ingredients to match the recipe by clicking on each  respective ingredient button in the craft panel. After ingredients are  added, clicking the \u201cBake\u201d button will send the cake to the oven, where  an oven timer will begin to countdown. The user will earn money and  receive critic feedback depending on if the cake was good or not. The  oven can also be upgraded by taking one second off overall bake rates  for $100.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By: Jordan London\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T05:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/20800833a8e249660f7889d133e85d48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlurryBit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
