Although the script extract will only show the beginning act of the game, the arc the player would have would depend on the choices they made throughout the game, such as what faction they join and what ending route they pursue.<br/><br/>The extract finds the player at the start of the game, down on their luck and low on funds, which leads them to take on a job from the rich landowner, Jack Bennett, which unintentionally puts the player in the centre of the game\u2019s major conflict between violent, water-worshipping religious extremists and pacifist earth-revering monks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8fa81c01258fd6e8495f43c1663ea35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Freya_Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
