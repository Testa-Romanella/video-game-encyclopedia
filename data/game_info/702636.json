She was honored by the gods and they gave her much. Thus her name, which means \u201cthe one who bears all gifts\u201d. However, this blessed woman would become the one to bear all evils because of one simple choice. Pandora was given a jar that was said to contain gifts from the gods, but was not permitted to open it. Riddled with curiosity, Pandora opened the jar and released all manner of evil upon the world. Now, she alone holds responsibility for mankind's suffering, at least in the eyes of her fellow man. Now, Pandora has her own, self given quest: to conquer the evils she has released. The gods will rue the day they used her in their twisted games.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Background/Scenery: Jenna\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Character/Enemies: Caleb\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Design: Sabrina\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Dialogue/Story: Jessica\r\n</p>\n<p>Level Design (platforms, placement, behaviors/effects, layout): Everyone\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b5e07f195820f98ba3fec7ca21b3787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cjm0077"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
