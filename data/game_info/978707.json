With him explore the Trash Moon, Deimos. Enter and secure it's most dangerous locations, each step drawing you closer to finding the Encryption Disks (E-Disks) needed to access restrict areas of the Moon. Return the toy bear home.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\ud83d\udd3bCOMBAT:</strong>    This moon is under strict lockdown and enforced by amped drones, and merciless mechs patrolling unknown corridors. What's left of humanity has been whittled down to unrecognizable entities, gathered in hordes, lying in the darkness feeding on uninfected matter. The conflicts that transpire aren't limited to surviving ambushes, but hacking data terminals, quarantining rift leaks, and outlasting spreading Nanocite. Don't worry, you're designed for confrontation, and equipped with a capable movement system. Master your Jump and Dodge Thrusters, and hold your reflexes relentless.  Move, and keep moving.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\ud83d\udd3bDEATH:</strong>    You've been connected to a dedicated Reboot Terminal, your home base. When your lives deplete, you will lose all carried resources including credits, only then will you be rebuilt at the Reboot Terminal.<br/><br/><strong>\ud83d\udd3bSTATAGY:</strong>    At your disposal is an arsenal of weapons and utilities. Discover unique combinations and strategy between them all. Utilities offer a wide range of approach; Proximity Mines, Gun Buddies, and Bubble Barriers, to name a few types, should be used with maximum efficiency.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not all weapons are created equal as modifying them gains an offensive advantage, and no Mod Schematic is ever the same. You Assault Androids are all the same, try not to get too attached to your armaments; you'll lose them if you're destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Check your local Depot, and spend Credits to resupply on armaments. Prepare to explore the moon not only by purchasing Ammo, Shield Cells, or Extra Lives, but access your locker system to retrieve or store the right weapons and utilities for the job.<br/><br/>There's no telling what you'll find in the deepest parts of this wasted moon, but preparation, focus, and determination will be required.
