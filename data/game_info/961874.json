Choose your specialisation and physical attributes, then compete in races to upgrade your skills and ultimately become the best cyclist in the world. The Tour de France 2023 and the year's major classics are yours to win!<br/><br/>In Tour de France 2023, you can manage your own team over a full cycling season in Pro Team mode. Start at the bottom of the world rankings, upgrade your team and show your tactical acumen to get noticed by the organisers of the biggest international races and be invited to race against the best. <br/><br/>Compete against other members of the community and prove you belong among the elite in the Race of the Moment world rankings. New challenges await every week: win a race as fast as possible, claim the yellow jersey or score the most points as possible in the mountains classification. No matter where your talents lie, everyone has a chance to shine.<br/><br/> <br/><ul><li>All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2023<br/></li><li>Updated rider and team ratings<br/></li><li>New Medium Mountain and Agility rating added<br/></li><li>New \"\"grupettos\"\" between riders added<br/></li><li>New challenges added to Race of the Moment mode<br/></li><li> A new mode has been introduced: Descent of the Moment<br/></li><li>Distinctive bibs added for \"\"super combative\"\" and the best team<br/></li><li>Improved rider behaviour and trajectories for more realistic races  <br/></li><li>Updated equipment items and official brands</li></ul> <br/><br/> <br/>To add more realism to races and more variety in the race to win the Tour de France, ratings for Medium Mountain and Agility have been added. Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d.<br/><br/>But be careful, because the lower the Agility rating of your cyclist, the more control you need! <br/><br/> <br/><br/>To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the \"\"super combative\"\" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! <br/><br/>Just like in real life, the riders now have the possibility to organize themselves in Grupetto to finish a stage quietly and keep their strength for the rest of the race. The riders also know how to regroup to form the morning breakaway and thus be more efficient to give more trouble to the teams leading the chase! <br/><br/><br/><br/>In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. <br/> <br/>All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. <br/><br/>The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety. There's also a brand-new mode: Downhill of the Moment. <br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062690/TDF23", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T02:33:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/246/24691adbf629a079a56671689c1c1aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 365, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyanide Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Nacon"], "esrb_rating": null}
