A character can be guided through a selection of literature genre-themed levels, ranging from horror to adventure and fantasy worlds. Magic can be used, and stomping enemies to death by jumping on their heads is permitted. Enemies include bats, flying books, giant hands, ghosts, pirates, and more. The PC version of the game is completely different; it is an interactive adventure game that has a plot unrelated to that of the movie.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe7cf6002602278015cb5d052f82e17a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SNES", "Game Boy", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Acclaim Cheltenham", "Probe Software", "Mammoth Micro Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Fox Interactive", "Turner Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
