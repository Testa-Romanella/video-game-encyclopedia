The version that is submitted at the end of the project is named GumDrop_SubmittedVer_OS. Future updated versions will be named GumDrop_V##_OS, if any.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Arrow keys or A/D to move left/right</p>\n<p>Use mouse to aim</p>\n<p>Left click to shoot</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<p>Jump in mid-air to slow your descent!</p>\n<p>The faster you clear a level, the more bonus score you get!</p>\n<p>Be careful of what you don't choose; it ends up in the enemy's hands. An enemy can be spawned with powers you didn't pick!</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<p><strong>Dynamic Game\u00a0Feel: </strong>Choosing a power up will change the level's colour scheme and give each side a random animal with its respective colour. Level decorations will also spawn in the level according to the power ups the enemies have.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Difficulty &amp; Pacing: </strong>The game paces back and forth to bring you moments of\u00a0high and low intensity. The game will increase its difficulty by an amount that's dependent\u00a0on how well you did, reducing the risk of sudden difficulty spikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cell Propagated Levels:</strong> Level generation made from a mix between cellular automata and modular generative techniques creates a versatile level that spawn as you go!</p>\r\nMusic Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Menu:</strong> \"Extreme G3\" by The VGM Man</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/user-839264154/extreme-g3</p>\n<p><strong>In-Game:</strong> \"Reggechill\" by RRound<br/>https://soundcloud.com/rround/reggechill</p>\n<p><strong>Game\u00a0Over Screen:</strong> Unnamed by my classmate Haseif</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5f6e924f4ee830ccc2af71ca95b1c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["elcoms"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
