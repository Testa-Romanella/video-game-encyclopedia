In this game you play a sphere trying to traverse the world I've made to reach the WIN objective at the end. Falling will be punished with a restart or return to a checkpoint, clever use of the jetpack function (Ctrl) and jump(spacebar) will separate the great players from the good! Enjoy my game and please feel free to leave feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded5a73e268e4269c3a073e1bb084876.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zultahn"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
