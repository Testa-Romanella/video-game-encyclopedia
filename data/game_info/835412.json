The Nazis have enjoyed massive success today;\u00a0your convoy has already encountered multiple U-boat wolfpacks on your crossing\u00a0back to Britain. All the other escorts have been sunk by German torpedoes; only\u00a0your battered and lonely corvette remains to give the unarmed merchant ships\u00a0hope of returning home safely. Now another wolfpack circles around the edges of\u00a0the convoy, waiting for night to fall...</p>\r\nThe Situation\r\n<p>Intel report is that tonight's wolfpack only has three u-boats, but they will\u00a0likely come from wildly different directions - meaning you will be very busy\u00a0tracking and sinking them, Lieutenant. With the Nazis now aware of our RADAR\u00a0advantage, their u-boats are no longer using surface tactics, so you're going\u00a0to be relying on your ASDIC and depth charges to get the job done. Fortunately,\u00a0this is expected to be the last wolfpack your convoy encounters before reaching\u00a0port, so get rid of these three without losing all your merchant ships and we'll\u00a0consider that a job well done. Oh, and keep yourself alive, too. No heroics this\u00a0time around; you can't protect the convoy if you've been sunk by a Nazi torpedo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few reminders about your ship and the information\u00a0at your disposal:</p>\n<ul><li>You're equipped with both <strong>ASDIC </strong>(active sonar) and <strong>hydrophones </strong>(passive).</li><li>You may manually <strong>engage the ASDIC</strong> so you can decide for yourself how long to\u00a0 wait between pings. The longer you wait before your next ping, the farther\u00a0away you'll be able to hear your targets.</li><li>U-boats in silent running mode are so quiet that you'll never hear them on the\u00a0 hydrophones at long range and you probably won't hear them at short range,\u00a0 either, unless they try to run to escape your depth charges.</li><li>Going slowly <strong>improves </strong>the performance of your ASDIC and hydrophones, going\u00a0 fast <strong>degrades </strong>it. This is especially true of the hydrophones.</li><li>Your <strong>throttle setting</strong> is shown in the bottom left of your tactical plotter.</li><li><strong>Three(3) depth charges</strong> may be loaded at once and once expended, your crew will\u00a0 reload the launchers<strong>; the number loaded is shown at the bottom right of your</strong><strong>\u00a0 tactical plotter.</strong></li><li>A depth charge takes several seconds to fall to its detonation depth and\u00a0 explode; <strong>you will need to time your drops to land on the enemy u-boats!</strong></li><li>Depth charges do more damage to submarines than to surface ships, but they\u00a0 can still hit you; <strong>don't be caught in the blast zone or you may sink yourself!</strong></li><li><strong>Depth charges also degrade ASDIC performance,</strong> so don't expect much of the\u00a0 device if you use it immediately after your charges go off.</li><li>Be careful when you're in the vicinity of a u-boat. They'll try to sneak away\u00a0 from you and if they manage it, <strong>they might just send a torpedo at you!</strong></li><li>A vessel that has taken enough damage will lose maneuverability and may not be\u00a0\u00a0able to use its engines at all!</li><li>Your depth charge crews will not reload as effectively if your ship is damaged\u00a0- an indicator will appear on your tactical plotter if so.</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard controls\r\n<ul><li>Left/right arrows:\u00a0steer left or right 45 degrees</li><li>Up/down arrows: increase/decrease throttle</li><li>S: sends out one ASDIC/SONAR pulse</li><li>D: drops one depth charge</li><li>P: pauses the gameplay</li><li>ESC: skips cinematics</li><li>ENTER: toggles fullscreen</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, pixel art, sound effects by Ryan Alban.
