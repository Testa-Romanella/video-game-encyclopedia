In their frequently challenging line of \n      work, the Rangers rely on their Capture Stylers--special devices that \n      only they are allowed to use. Using their Catupture Stylers, the Rangers \n      borrow the abilities of Pok\u00e9mon to uphold Fiore's peace. But look out \n      for the Go-Rock Squad--they want to use Pok\u00e9mon for a more sinister \n      purpose, and it's up to the Pok\u00e9mon Rangers to help stop them. It's an \n      adventure that gets you into the Pok\u00e9mon action like never before!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
