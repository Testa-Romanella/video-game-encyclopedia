It is a 2016 update from the 2014 version found on google's store. This is why I'm calling it special edition! Because you guys are awesome! Any feedback of the game is highly appreciated! Keep it though as constructive as possibly can. </p><p>Also, this game was made with gamemaker studio. I tried my best to fully get this game from literally a dream to game code reality. You will encounter many glitches and game breaking bugs. As I am alone in developing this, I wish I could get extra help on it. I want to remake it in Unity with added features, like multiplayer and actually have story mode. Right now it's only arcade style, but if I could get that extra help, it would be highly appreciated! </p><p>Thank you for your interest in this game! Hope you have a wonderful day!</p><p>-Gerardo-</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8203d6bb18598059b99f6a96437dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Gerardo Valerio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
