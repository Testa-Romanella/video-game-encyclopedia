{"id": 410138, "slug": "death-rocks", "name": "Death Rocks", "name_original": "Death Rocks", "description": "<p>Death Rocks is an edgy (possibly overly so) game\u00a0 about dropping a rock on your own head. Unlike most runners, the goal is to die. Obviously, this is meant to be a fun, light-hearted game. If you actually need help, there are countless resources online. This isn't one of them. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in Collaboration with IDislikeNames!<br/></p><p>In order to achieve your end goal---landing a rock on your head, you must first throw the rock, which includes two steps: determining the angle you throw it in and determining the strength you throw with, both can be accomplished by pressing the spacebar. After throwing the rock, you must catch up to the rock via running (and occasionally an ambulance car). However, there will be obstacles in your path, and you can avoid them by going up and down with the arrow keys. Note that some obstacles will harm you, which helps you accomplish your goals better since the rock, by\u00a0itself,<strong> will not kill you.\u00a0</strong>Make sure you stay ahead of the rock, since, if it lands before you get there, you'll need to find some other way of getting your HP to zero beforehand. Press left and right to speed up or slow down.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/008536b6c7ed0bbbda1b6a2efd641518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
