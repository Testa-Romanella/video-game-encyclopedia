Converting the project for webGL\u00a0did strange things to my canvas scaling and I did a few quick fixes for now but it will need some more attention when I have some free time!\u00a0<strong>The UI is worse in fullscreen mode \u00ac.\u00ac</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The pieces can sometimes\u00a0get a little lost or bugged so there is a reset pieces button at the top (left-hand side) of the screen that will respawn any of the pieces that are not currently placed!</strong></p><p><strong>Also also! If any of the pieces are acting a bit strange just let them go and pick them up again! That often sorts them out!</strong></p><p>(As you can see I\u00a0had some physics bugs that I couldn't fix... ^^;;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T18:08:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/6323664f092575902cad13f51d39eccd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NinetailedJay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
