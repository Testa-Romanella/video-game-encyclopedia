{"id": 12361, "slug": "wargame-red-dragon", "name": "Wargame: Red Dragon", "name_original": "Wargame: Red Dragon", "description": "<p>Wargame: Red Dragon is the second part in Wargame series and a sequel to Wargame: AirLand Battle. Its campaigns are based on alternate history concepts. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the Cold War era. Wargame: Red Dragon follows a series of fictional yet plausible conflicts between the various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the campaign mode, its timeline covers the 1970s, 1980s, and up until 1996. The player controls various factions, both from Eastern and Western bloc. The story campaign includes a civil war in Korea, a Chinese invasion of the Russian Far East, a conflict over British-occupied Hong Kong, a Kuril islands border conflict, and a Soviet invasion of Korea.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls his or her units from a top-down view in the real time. At each level, the player and his or her opponent, whether AI or the other human player, start at the different sides of a map and fight to control it. Being a wargame by definition, Wargame: Red Dragon doesn&#39;t have much of economic element. The player deploys the already existing units rather than creates them. To receive reinforcements during the battle, the player has to capture and hold specific parts of the map that serve as deployment zones. </p>\n<p>Besides the campaign mode, the game offers its players to choose from more than twenty nations, and additional nations are available through DLC. Wargame: Red Dragon also has a competitive multiplayer mode.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2014-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-30T13:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecb32cf472d803aabd3a18c35866186b.jpg", "website": "http://wargame-rd.com/", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 107, "owned": 1113, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 42, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 81, "suggestions_count": 439, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 83, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eugen Systems"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
