With him, he has his sense pedestal. It allows him to have senses again, but with a limitation. He can only have at a time. Help him explore the house, lick it all, and find the limited amount of things to interact with.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Use Q and E to change sense. Some items are intractable, press space with the right sense selected to interact with them. Press escape to end the game.</p>\n<p>This game was created Smorg and Magicanz, and this is our first time competing in a game jam, which may explain the lack of content. However, we will continue with this concept further, so stay tuned!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15e/15e6d17db259c7a357ae40d4c9687033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smorg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
