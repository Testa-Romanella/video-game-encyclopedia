Experience intense tactical online multiplayer action and explore a deep plot and unique storyline built on both single-player and multiplayer missions.<br/><br/>In the near future, Earth is hit by an unusual meteorite swarm: the remains of alien fleets decimated by an ancient galactic war. To avoid widespread panic, world governments hide the truth from the population by sending elite mercenary squads to crash sites \u2013 gaining access to the alien technology before anyone else can do the same. <br/><br/>As a leader of one of these paramilitary organizations, you have to successfully scout, secure, and deliver the weapons and intel found in each alien crash site to paying governments indifferent to loss of life. In time \u2013 while performing extremely dangerous incursions for alien artifacts \u2013 you begin to lift the veil behind government conspiracies and state-sponsored attempts to use alien technology to control the world\u2019s population. This is only the tip of the iceberg as far as \u201cfirst contact\u201d goes: Humanity faces a much more real serious threat that could lead to the total eradication of mankind.<br/><br/>In physics, \u201cram pressure\u201d is a pressure exerted on a body moving through a fluid medium, caused by relative bulk motion of the fluid rather than random thermal motion. It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body. . . . A meteoroid traveling supersonically through Earth's atmosphere produces a shock wave generated by the extremely rapid compression of air in front of the meteoroid. It is primarily this ram pressure (rather than friction) that heats the air that in turn heats the meteoroid as it flows around it.

Establish contact with any surviving alien beings and uncover the factors that led to the extinction of their civilization. To succeed, you will need to equip and customize your soldiers to make them a well oiled, effective fighting force \u2026 eventually gaining knowledge of secrets literally beyond imagination.<br/><br/><ul><li>Experience intense tactical online multiplayer action.<br/></li><li>Explore a deep plot and unique storyline built on both single-player and multiplayer missions.<br/></li><li>Upgrade your weapons and armor from a massive selection of 100 guns and 10 weapon classes \u2013 including high-tech and alien weapons.<br/></li><li>Customize your characters with 12 classes and 160 skills.<br/></li><li>Lay waste to the environment for tactical purposes!<br/></li><li>Enjoy procedurally-generated maps, day and night missions, and changing weather conditions.<br/></li><li>Join clans and take part in a complex alliance system.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c684959f32f1163370d579d2469233c.jpg", "website": "https://rampressure.game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 545, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["QuadCom Interactive", "GDT"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GDT"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
