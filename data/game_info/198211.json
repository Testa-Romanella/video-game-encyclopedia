I won't be actively fixing these things in this build since I already have limited time to work on this game and having to support another platform is a huge amount of work on top of what I already have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f237355c2b31db705dde3debfdc3a5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["p0isonedpanda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
