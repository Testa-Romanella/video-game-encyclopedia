The character flees from this powerful and lethal source of radiation (Alpha radiation), while players have to avoid obstacles and hazardous elements, such as other kinds of radiation (Beta and Gamma), by jumping or deciding not to jump, depending on each case.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Xbox controller:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>X/Y:</strong>\u00a0Choosing easy mode and putting glasses on/off.</li><li><strong>A/B:</strong>\u00a0Choosing hard mode and jumping.</li><li><strong>ESC (Keyboard)</strong>: Close the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard and mouse:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>G:</strong>\u00a0Choosing easy mode and putting glasses on/off.</li><li><strong>SPACEBAR:</strong>\u00a0Choosing hard mode and jumping.</li><li><strong>ESC</strong>: Close the game.</li></ul>\n\r\nPlay the game here!<p><strong>You can play the game online right now at the following site:</strong><br/><strong>\u27f6</strong> https://itch.io/embed-upload/1755248?color=baa50e<strong> \u27f5</strong><br/><em>*We need to fix a bug regarding the size of the HUD.

Next, all the alarms start to ring as loud as they have never rung before. As soon as the worker realizes the current hazardous situation, they let everyone know about it, and when everyone has been alarmed, the former worker heads to an emergency exit. It is now when they start to run as fast as they can, as some radiation is already spreading due the nuclear meltdown.</p>\n\r\nA comic featuring the narrative of Nuclear Panic\r\nGameplay video\r\n\r\nGitHub repository\r\n<p>You can find the public repository of <strong>Nuclear Panic</strong>\u00a0at the following GitHub link:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdrianNP57/Nuclear-Panic.</p>\r\nFurther information\r\n<p>You can read more about the IDXPO\u00a02019 where the video game was showcased at the following link:<br/>\r\nhttps://adriannavarroperez.wordpress.com/activities/idxpo2019/.</p>\n<p>You can even read more information about <strong>Nuclear Panic</strong> at its official website:<br/>http://www.idxpo.se/2019/Nuclear-Panic/index.html.</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li><strong>Adri\u00e1n Navarro P\u00e9rez.</strong></li><li><strong>Alexia Dauvergne.</strong></li><li><strong>Christopher William Black.</strong></li><li><strong>Jesper Jansson.</strong></li><li><strong>Muhammad Ashar Imtiaz.</strong></li><li><strong>Samuel Soutullo Sobral.</strong></li></ul>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Here I list the free copyright assets we used for the implementation of the game:</p>\n<ul><li>2D Simple Character : Swordsman by Black Hammer:\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/2d-simple-character-swordman-133259.</li><li>Free Halloween 2D Game Backgrounds by craftpix.net:\r\nhttps://craftpix.net/freebies/free-halloween-2d-game-backgrounds/.</li><li>Walking on Metal Sound Effects by Nick Judy:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlrnABUcyzE.</li><li>Sound FX - Retro Pack by Zero Rare (Levi Moore):\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/sound-fx-retro-pack-121743.</li><li>04b_30 Font by 04:\r\nhttps://www.dafont.com/04b-30.font.</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to all these talented and collaborative authors!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:11:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd469f6ae8947d58430eb4152a655752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adri\u00e1n Navarro P\u00e9rez", "ChrWBlack", "Samuel Soutullo Sobral"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
