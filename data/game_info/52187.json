You'll play cards and roll dice to increase conversation points, decrease the threat level, and release hostages. Hostage Negotiator uses a unique \"hand-building\" mechanism that puts cards you purchase directly in your hand for next turn rather than leaving you wondering when the cards will show up like in deck-building games.<br/><br/>In Hostage Negotiator there are multiple paths to victory, but the hostage taker has other plans. Will you try to calm him and get him to surrender? Will you stall and bide your time before sending in the team for a major extraction? How many hostages will you save? These are many of the exciting decisions you will make in a game of Hostage Negotiator!<br/><br/>Features: <br/>Play against 4 villains, each, with their own personalities. <br/>Interactive tutorial teaches the rules and basic strategy as you play.<br/>The app tracks a variety of player statistics.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T00:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/784/78449978520cbac9c2f21d55968a20a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Peter Kossits"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Peter Kossits"], "esrb_rating": null}
