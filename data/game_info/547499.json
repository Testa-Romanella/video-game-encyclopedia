If the algorithm is able to solve the game, it's then added to a stack from which games are picked every time you start a new game. (It's not a guarantee that you'll solve the game tho, it depends on the choices you make, in which order, etc)</p>\n<br/>\r\nCustom drag-and-drop code\r\n<p>The default browser behaviour requires you to place the cursor directly on the element on which you want to drop something. But what if you grab a card by the bottom-right corner and drop it on a pile with just the top-right corner above the pile\u00a0? I take that edge case into account\u00a0(and some others) to make sure\u00a0it's\u00a0friction-less and pleasant to use.</p>\n<br/>\r\nHints and auto-complete\r\n<p>Using the game-solving algorithm, I added a button that can give you hints or auto-complete the game when all cards have been revealed. There is no pre-calculated path to victory, the algorithm just suggest the most useful move based on the current state of the game (it does not see in advance every possible outcomes).</p>\n<br/>\r\nLightweight and fast\r\n<p>It's made\u00a0with VueJS and other web technologies so it's pretty fast and has a small footprint on ressources.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>I couldn't find a plain and simple Klondike solitaire game that is also good-looking and\u00a0well executed so I (hopefully) made one.<br/><br/>There is still some things I want to add (like sounds, daily achievements, tutorial,\u00a0a more rewarding winning screen, multiplayer somehow?,\u00a0etc.) but so far the game is very playable as it is.</p>\n<p>The game is hosted here\u00a0if you want to play directly\u00a0<em>(the itch.io version is just an embed of this url).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:51:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3e75aa08578e5015e97bbc65632bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wmcmurray"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
