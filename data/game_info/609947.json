My name is Nikko. I'm the developer of this game. Although it's really not much more than just a game\u00a0environment. You can run around and explore the terrain. There are also a few weapons you can play with as well, but the game lacks any interactivity beyond that.\u00a0When left idle though, the game does enter\u00a0a demo mode that uses slow camera-pans and fly-throughs to showcase views around the island. Which can actually\u00a0make for some pretty chill background visuals.</p>\n<p>This game was\u00a0made in 2013 using Unity 4, and was the first in a series of island themed game projects, including Isla Noir and The Island Project.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in this game. If you enjoy the experience, please consider making a small contribution to the project. <br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0appreciate the support.\u00a0Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/8498506e9f4f2339dce63a845f05b1e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nikkolai Davenport"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
