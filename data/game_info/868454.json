{"id": 868454, "slug": "mathknight", "name": "MathKnight", "name_original": "MathKnight", "description": "<p>MathKnight is a mobile game that will help you in studying and practicing in science - mathematics. But unlike other similar games, MathKnight does not turn into boring cramming, since the player has a goal - to reach a new location, get a new trophy or earn a new avatar. Also, MathKnight has a large and interesting world, with unique creatures and an original plot:</p>\n<p>The MathKnight game takes place in the familiar Middle Ages, with knights, princesses and dragons, however, mathematics plays a huge role in this world. Mathematics is found everywhere and is used almost everywhere, because why is it stupid to swing a sword if you can calculate the angle and force of impact?</p>\n<p>In this world, people are not alone, there are many creatures here that we would call monsters, but here they are ordinary residents, with their own traditions, lifestyle and society. They, just like humans, use mathematics for their lives, but their use is different from human. Most of the \"monsters\" are unable to use mathematics on their own, so they take advantage of the mistakes of others who are capable of independent solutions. Such a system is very difficult for people to understand, but \"monsters\" use it on an intuitive level, for example, the same slimes.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to be in such a world, but there is one thing that ignores mathematical laws - magic, and magicians have magic. Possessing great power, the wizards immediately began to do whatever they wanted, 4 wizards stood out, who were able to develop their magical abilities to the limit. One of these wizards decided to take control of the entire island, using a spell that works like a virus. It can capture the mind of \"monsters\", ordering them to get rid of people and other creatures that the spell did not work on.</p>\n<p>Almost the entire population of the island has already managed to sail away, in search of new islands. But many people and thousands of other creatures are left here, some are trying to fight, and some are just surviving as best they can. But one noble knight (and part-time player) decided to get rid of this curse and destroy the wizard. The path will not be easy ... as many as 5 different locations with a variety of opponents, hundreds of levels and a huge amount of new knowledge. The path will be difficult, but interesting. Good luck, knights!</p>\n<p>We hope we were able to interest you and you will continue to follow our game, now you can test the beta version of the game in our\u00a0Discord. We are waiting for everyone!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T08:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdf24699849ca969f239fff2d93aee47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["aMaskStudio"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
