This is an arcade, pixel art space shooter with the ability to play with both your friend through sharing a keyboard or fighting the A.I.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get the most amount of points before the game ends by shooting the sun into your enemy goal before the can put the sun into yours, you could also gain points by shooting and destroying the sun with your shots!</p>\n<p>\u00a0You can only move in two directions using the keys you set yourself, you also have the ability to shoot a normal shots and a set amount of special shots after you get a powerup.</p>\n<p>These powerups are(for now)</p>\n<p>Power Shots: Slower Shots with More Damage and Further Knockback</p>\n<p>Delay Shots: They stop the sun in its place and remove the ability to be affected be other shots for a time. Then once that time is up, it sends the Sun in the direction the delay shot hit.</p>\n<p>Change Positions: This will move all players around the map in a clockwise rotation, forcing the borders and goals to move as well.</p>\n<p>As this in a work in progress I am still working on updating Sprites, Powerups, Balance, Sounds and potentially online multiplayer if I can figure out how that works!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time reading all of this! I hope you enjoy this early experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:33:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a25a88c4d47347992a2c71118ca429.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingWeirdo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
