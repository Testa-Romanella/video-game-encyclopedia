You sole objective is to find minerals that you can use to create Oxygen, because that's important in space. As well as minerals for crafting fuel. You have to hop from planet to planet to find more resources.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watch out! Space is vast. Don't run out of fuel and drift in the void forever.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Use your Jump Thruster[space] to begin lift off from a planets surface. Toggle your Main Orbit Thrusters on[R]. Move Up and Down [Q &amp; E], and use WASD to move about in space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>LMB - Interact / Range Finder<br/>RMB - Shows some information</p>\n<p>Once you have drifted close enough to a planet. Just relax and let gravity do the work for you. Remember to not approach a planet too fast. Gravity acts weird in deep space. The chances of gravity throwing you back into deep space is high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you find yourself drifting off into space. Reset yourself by pressing \"P\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Judging</strong></p>\n<p>Not all code was done by me. I did use one outside source for the base character controller, and planet physics.\u00a0 See the special thanks section below for more details.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no background music, or sound effects in the game. My art style is lacking at best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to judge the game in all areas you see fit.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final\u00a0Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>Once you look past my lack of anything artistically related. I believe there is a good game in there somewhere. I would like in the future to update this game to what it should have been. A full space survival game with better crafting abilities,\u00a0 and even some building. That is just my personal opinion, please let me know what you think.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0 @GamePartum</p>\n<p>Youtube Channel:\u00a0PartumGameTutorials<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>************Special thanks goes to Sebastian Lague************</strong></p>\n<p>His code and tutorials provided the base gravity mechanic, as well as the base First Person Controller script used in the game.
