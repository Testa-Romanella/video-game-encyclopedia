An unknown, corrupting force has begun to take root among the denizens of this mystical plane. Twisting, perverting, and corrupting them into monstrous forms and damaging their connection to the natural order. It is up to Eyvrali, a young planestrider, to restore order and balance to the Seelwylde by cleansing the inhabitants of their corruption and bringing back the connections that once harmonized them all. Your objective is to go around the Seelwylde and collect wisps. With wisps, you are able to purify any corrupted creatures that you come across. To deal with these creatures, first, you must stun them then you must get close to purify\u00a0them. If you get hit, you will lose all of your wisps and have to collect them again. If you get hit without any wisps in possession, the game is over.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD: Move around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spacebar: Jump.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Click: Fire.
