Your actions will have an impact.</p>\n<p>For Ludum Dare 40 in December 2017 I teamed up with Lorelei who made the beautiful graphics. The theme of the jam was \"The more you have, the worse it is<strong>\"</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>I never posted this jam version here, at the time we wanted to make a nice polished post-jam version. Lorele\u00ef worked on another game during the jam so she did the graphics very quickly and wanted to improve them, I wanted to add or correct some gameplay aspects based on input from Ludum Dare community but we never did find the time nor motivation, both caught with life matters :(</p>\n<p>Therefore the game is a bit rough around the edges.<br/></p><p>It's obviously inspired by the excellent \"Where The Goats Are\" by Memory of God (play it it's excellent ! \u2764\ufe0f). <br/>\r\nThe author of the beautiful ambient track you can hear in the game is Jack Taylor the same composer who made music for Where The Goats Are.</p>\n<p>This game reminds me of IndieCade Europe in Paris in 2017 where I met Lorele\u00ef and other wonderful people :) <br/>It's also where I discovered Where The Goats Are are had the chance to briefly speak with it's developper.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>\r\ngraphics by Lorele\u00ef<br/>original ambient track by Jack Taylor (licensed under CC 4.0)<br/>\r\ndesign, coding and all the rest by axoona <br/>\r\nMade with Unity3D. <br/></p><p><strong>BONUS<br/></strong>Finished background graphics by Lorele\u00ef' \u2764\ufe0f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc6141170da9e9144b3b12f897781590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["axoona"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
