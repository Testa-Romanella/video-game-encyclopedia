The point of the game is to have players interact and manipulate the fractional pieces to build the whole because all fractions come from one whole of something.\u00a0 Players need to identify and obtain the scattered fractions from around the pond to create one whole.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1a947ddedee0cb966999440d60298c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrwilliams"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
