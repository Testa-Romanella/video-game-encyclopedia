{"id": 140978, "slug": "8-bit-battles", "name": "8-bit Battles", "name_original": "8-bit Battles", "description": "<p>A simplified take on RPG combat inspired by classic games like Sword of Hope and Dragon Warrior. 8-bit Battles captures the feeling of exploiting enemy weaknesses and leveling a character without having to micro-manage stats. It's perfect for anyone who wants the flavor of an RPG in the amount of time it takes to ride the train to work.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>- 30 monsters to fight, including the ultra-difficult boss Heltos</p><p>- Discover enemy weaknesses and exploit them for massive damage</p><p>- Gain new attacks and abilities by unlocking items</p><p>- Simple gameplay that gets more nuanced as you progress</p><p>- No scary clowns, giant lobsters, or singing pigeons.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p>- Tap an action to select, then tap an enemy to attack.</p><p>- Enemies attack more frequently when the screen is full, so focus on eliminating them as quickly as you can.</p><p>- Enemies only have a few hit points, but your attacks do only a few damage. To maximize efficiency, try learning each enemy's elemental weaknesses. Some of them give you a clue if you tap and hold on their icon. You can also listen for the \"swish\" sound, which indicates an effective attack.</p><p>- Your XP bar also serves as a HP gauge. You gain XP by killing enemies and using all of your attacks. You lose it when enemies attack you or you use the manual attack refresh button.</p><p>- Fill the XP bar up to gain a level, unlocking new items and new enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a54ce86e8b2fab321c7f354e1b11e3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bard"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
