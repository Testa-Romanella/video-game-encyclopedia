{"id": 101645, "slug": "emma-a-ladys-maid-demo", "name": "Emma: A Lady's Maid - Demo", "name_original": "Emma: A Lady's Maid - Demo", "description": "Emma is the lady's maid to the eldest daughter of the Beresford family, Eveline. With no interest in ladylike persuits, the young lady feigns illness at every opportunity for a ball, soiree, or other social activity.\u00a0\r\nBut Emma is no ordinary maid. So when she and her mistress are sent on a journey in the sky, with balls and soirees that are host to many eligible bachelors, the adventure is only just beginning...\r\n<p>Word Count: ~7000</p>\n<p>Single playthrough: 15-45 minutes</p>\r\n\r\nSetting\r\n<p>The 19th century.<br/>Victoria is Queen of Anglia.<br/>William Darwin is Prime Minister.<br/><br/>Steam-powered technology has spread across the world like wild-fire, enabling global trade and travel of the grandest scale. Ships travel the skyway with ever more interesting cargo - transglobal goods, contraband, princesses - perfect treasure for sky pirates, many of whom operate without a piracy license. Land transport, on the other hand, is dominated by trains, though the locomobile is slowly gaining traction with forward-thinking gentry and nouveau riche.</p>\r\nLove Interests\r\n<p>Although you only meet the love interests briefly in the demo, there are two in the game: a nobleman and a female scientist. I would also like to include a male pirate, if there is time.</p>\r\nSpecialisations\r\n<p>At the start of the story, you can choose a specialisation in three different areas: academics, social graces, and forbidden science. These specialisations unlock additional scenes, solutions, and dialogue options throughout the game. In the demo, you get the opportunity to fully explore a challenging puzzle based on a specialisation.<br/></p>\r\nChoices, Choices\r\n<p>The game features a mixture of VN-style choices and RPG-style choices, where some heavily impact the story, while others just add a bit more flavour to your interactions. For those choices that affect the grand scheme of things, there is a slightly different graphic, so you always know whether your decisions are big or small.<br/></p>\n\r\nBackgrounds\r\n<p>Only 1 background in the demo, I'm afraid. I am using an image drawn during the era that is now in the public domain - with a couple of photoshop tweaks. I know that doesn't exactly sell the game, but I thought I'd be honest about this. :)<br/></p>\r\n\r\nRelease Date\r\n<p>This project is not my main project, I'm working on it on-and-off while doing other things, such as Stranded Hearts and work I do for a living. As such it will probably take a while. I hope to commit a lot more time to it in the future, once I've released a few more shorter VNs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a53076ddcd2a339bcefb00ed69f5da9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DreamGate"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
