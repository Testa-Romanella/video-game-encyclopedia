It's a fast, safe and effective way to transport people and goods, a rarity in a world where the sea and air space are getting more and more dangerous... With their new train, the company seems to live up to their slogan \"Better future, for better people\". But already some are wondering, is it a promise, or a threat? <br/></p>\n<p>Is destroying the train, the symbol and the pride of the company, enough to leave the whole corporation vulnerable?
