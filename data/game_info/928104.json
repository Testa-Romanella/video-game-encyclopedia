It\u2019s kind of ironic, come to think of it, as I\u2019ve never left my village. Neither had my dad and his dad before him. It\u2019s the same for everyone in our land since our four statues of wellness were stolen one night moons ago. Everyone seems to be cursed with numbness, immobility and indifference. Adventure, curiosity, audacity and courage are words that have disappeared from our vocabulary. </p>\n<p> I was born in Porkville and, as sure as the gods made little green apples, I know I\u2019m going to die in Porkville. Without ever leaving the valley. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s a nice and pleasant lowland with green pastures, fruit trees, wild mushrooms, flowers and a beautiful little pond. <br/>The only thing that disturbs the peace of this little haven are the mosquitoes and the fireflies. I hate these stupid insects and I sometimes chase them. I have to be thankful to them though as it is during one of my mundane bug hunts that I stumbled upon the entrance to a cave... Could this be my quest?
