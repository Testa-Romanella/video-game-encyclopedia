Every row and column will have one or more numbers, every number will represent a group of correct squares (For example, a single \"2\" means that in that row or column there will be exactly two black squares, next to each other). Between every group there will be at least one empty space (a \"1-5\" consist of a single black square, one or multiple spaces and 5 black squares next to each other).\u00a0 The number order matters (\"1-5\" and \"5-1\" aren't the same thing), also remember that these are logical puzzles, random guessing won't help you!\r\n  </p>\n<p>How to solve a pictogram:\r\n  </p>\n<p>-First of all, an \"8\" means that every square in the row or column will be correct, a \"0\" means the opposite. You can start by filling every \u201c8\u201d and marking every \u201c0\u201d.\r\n  </p>\n<p>-Some sequences will fill the whole row (\"1-6\", \"3-4\", \"1-4-1\"...). Try to sum up the numbers and the minimal required number of spaces, if it results in an \"8\" then you are good to go.</p>\n<p>-After you find every correct square in a row or column, remember to mark the rest of the cells as empty spaces\r\n  </p>\n<p>! harder techniques that you'll need in the advanced puzzles!\r\n  </p>\n<p>-Bigger numbers and sequences will always occupy some squares, no matter the number's position (for example, if you have a column with a single \"6\", you can count 6 up from the bottom and 6 down from the top: you'll see that the 4 central squares will always be used).\r\n  </p>\n<p>-And for smaller numbers, after you find some squares, you'll see that some cells will always be excluded (for example, if you have a row with a single \"2\" and you already found a correct square, you can mark every other cell as an empty space but the two ones adjacent to the correct square).\r\n</p>\n<p>tanks to Nyan and Aridai for playtesting, and Kat for fixing my broken english!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc34261b3d980df7b138c4bde0c2eb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmmaBelotti"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
