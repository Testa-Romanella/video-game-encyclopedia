It was invented by the ancient Hawaiian Polynesians. The game begins with all the counters laid out on the board in an alternating pattern of black and white. Players then hop over one another's pieces capturing them similar to checkers. The first player who can no longer make a capture is the loser, and the other player is the winner.<br/>In ancient times, the pieces used were black and white lava stones played over a large rock which doubled as a board and table.<br/>The game appears somewhat similar to draughts. Pieces hop over one another when capturing. However, the similarities end there. In draughts, one player's pieces are initially set up on one side of the board opposite the other player's pieces. In Konane, both players' pieces are intermixed in an alternating pattern of black and white that covers the whole board. Furthermore, in Konane all moves are capturing moves, and they are done in an orthogonal direction (not diagonally).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:41:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c301c3730be90f52f1e87712d410d7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["POK"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Pok Wong"], "esrb_rating": null}
