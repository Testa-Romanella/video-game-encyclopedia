You know that most newbies don\u2019t know what gear is best for them, so your store advertises accurate class recommendations. If a customer doesn\u2019t like your choice, they get that equipment for half the cost! So, do your best to listen and pick the gear that matches their personality - that way everyone wins!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tough game out there. Just keep up with demand and you\u2019ll do great!<br/><br/></p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Hi, I'm Zach, half of the team at studio Haiku. This jam, I decided to push my limits by solo-developing. And, indeed, my limits were pushed! A lot of ideas had to be\u00a0scrapped to make the game playable come submission time. You'll no doubt notice that there isn't any real goal in the game as of yet, and that's because I let myself get sidetracked by all the systems I wanted to set up. Regardless of fun-factor, I think it's a quaint little experience and I'm proud of it!\u00a0Ideally, both of us at Studio Haiku will continue working on the game, adding class\u00a0materials and a side-quest system (conspicuously absent on the side panel).<br/></p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<p>The game will soft lock itself if you run out of inventory supplies or money. Basically, that's the only end possible in the game for now. Sorry about that!<br/></p>\r\nCreditsDesign, Visuals, Code, Music: Zachary DelgrosWriting: Jasper Andrews, Kyle LimSound Effects: Freesound.org (CC0)\r\nThanks for playing! :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T04:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d534f0a99e53e07026338acfaeccd9d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Studio Haiku"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
