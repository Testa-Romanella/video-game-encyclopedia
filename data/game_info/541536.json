There might be one or two other bugs, which i will try to get rid of them as soon as possible, however i can't seem to reproduce them in my developing app, thus it might take a while [/edit]<br/></p>\n<p>ISORROPIA is a Tetris clone with a unique Twist. The game board is split in two and placed onto a scale. Try to keep the scale in mind when placing the tiles. It won't revolutionize the Tetris world, but it sure is a fun experiment :)</p>\n<p>Proper introductions can be found in the game itself, just as well as the Keys. But just in case:</p>\n<ul><li>[z] to rotate counter clockwise</li><li>[x] to rotate clockwise</li><li>[space] to instantly hit the ground</li><li>[ArrowKeys] to move</li><li>[M] to toggle Music</li><li>[ESC] for the pause/exit menu</li></ul>\n<p>Made in under one week  for Game\u00a0Endevaours GameJam#3 with the theme \"Duality\".\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/ge-jam-3</p><p>Due to working on it until the last minute it's not quite as optimized as it could have been. But it is playable and that's the important part.
