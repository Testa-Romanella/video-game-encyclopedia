Playing as a peaceful and nice blue cloud of particles, traverse randomly-generated node-based labyrinths and avoid spooky red  clouds of particles. The game is open-ended - each level beaten increases the complexity of the following levels.</p>\n<p>HOW</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to click on the nodes and move the player between them. Only the nodes connected to the currently-occupied one can be moved to, naturally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The level is won when the player occupies the green node.</p>\n<p>The level (and the game) is lost when an enemy either moves to the node the player is currently on, or collides with the player while they both traverse between connected nodes.</p>\n<p>OTHER THINGS</p>\n<p>There are probably some bugs and glitches here and there - I haven't tested the game all that rigorously for obvious reasons (though I know of at least one bug already).</p>\n<p>All code and assets were created from scratch over the course of the development time, apart from music and sound effects which are re-used from other projects of mine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T17:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4257381e6bd9e7ba0d38f14f5c0d3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
