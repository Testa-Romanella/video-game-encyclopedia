It's a fun enough sandbox where you can dig around! But there isn't a real objective, or a reason to dig. Except seeing how the minerals get sent into space. Unless they drop back down.</p>\n<p>I modeled and added the mineral storage hut (seen right at the start of the game) during the last half-hour, so it is a little buggy. The most noticeable issue is probably that it will disappear if you wander around the planet one too many times (literally: make one lap and it won't be there).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f7/8f7e03135d48720148e6cb6aea66e1d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Neon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
