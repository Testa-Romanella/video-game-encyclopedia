{"id": 789262, "slug": "cold-massacre", "name": "Cold Massacre", "name_original": "Cold Massacre", "description": "<strong>Story:</strong><br/>People are fragile, and if they get pushed too much in an order of magnitude for too long then you could say the glass will break. Maybe this person was just unlucky. Going to Norway in a secluded place and everything, or maybe he just sought out such an adventure, but something tells me he did not expect what was coming for him. Perhaps that mask he saw in the darkness is ingrained into his mind. I wouldn't know, he was the one that was a part of the cold massacre after all.<br/><br/>You do know who I am, right?<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>This game has 8 endings you have to get, you can do whatever you want within the game, but there is a killer chasing after you. The most important thing to remember is to look for the subtle clues you find in this desolate place...<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>- 8 endings<br/>- Many puzzles<br/>- Thrilling chase-scenes<br/>- Relentless killer<br/>- An underlying story<br/><br/><strong>Optimizations:</strong><br/>This game can easily be played on a low-end computer, but expect a little stuttering every now and then if your computer is really bad. If your framerate is exceptionally awful try turning off V-Sync and Chromatic Aberration in the options menu. Do keep in mind that V-Sync will typically make the game smoother on a high-end PC. Overall the game should be pretty smooth even for low-end PCs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T04:32:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/292/292e550c29bd4cb5e35b5099413acd40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeventyFour Productions", "Nithriotto Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nithriotto Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
