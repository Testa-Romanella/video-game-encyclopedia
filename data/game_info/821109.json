In this table-top-style dungeon crawler, you'll need to be careful about every move to avoid the blood-thirsty creatures in your path.

No matter which of these roads you go down, one thing's for sure - things are gonna get dicey!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:09:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/3633346fab4d3726333b49b3cfa0de8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Scaroficous"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
