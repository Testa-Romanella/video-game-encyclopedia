{"id": 714116, "slug": "ultramarine-turtles-dream", "name": "Ultramarine Turtle's Dream", "name_original": "Ultramarine Turtle's Dream", "description": "1. About \r\n<p>Ultramarine Turtle's Dream is a Bishoujo/Ren-Ai/Visual Novel type game. Meaning, we have pictures, music, text, and we traverse it by clicking and reading. In our case, there are no branches or choices - the game has one static path, and so it belongs to a subgenre sometimes called \"Kinetic novel\". The story is simple, and I hope it grabs your interest.</p>\n<p>The game was made for the Best Ren-ai game competition, that was held at the Animefest 2009 convention, where it received the 3rd place prize. Originally written in the Slovak language, translated to English by mikey.<br/></p>\r\n2. Installation\r\n<p>Nothing fancy. Download the game, extract it, and run STK.exe.</p>\r\n3. Controls\r\n<p>Click the left mouse button or press Enter to move the story forward.</p>\n<p>Main menu is accessible by right clicking. There are some functions available there, like save / load and exit :)</p>\n<p>To hide the text field, press space.</p>\n<p>Fullscreen experience is enabled by the fabled Alt+Enter combo.</p>\n<p>History is opened by mouse wheel up, and you can use the mouse wheel to scroll through it. Click to exit the history mode.</p>\n<p>Close the game by Alt+F4 or the big bad X in the corner.</p>\r\n4. Problems\r\n<p>The game is done on an old .NET framework, so hopefully if you have version 2.0 or newer, it should work. It even runs through Wine on Linux!</p>\r\n5. FAQ\r\n<p>Q: WTF Turtle?<br/>A: So what? You weebs would be fine if the name was Kame Aoi.</p>\n<p>Q: Why?<br/>A: It looked like a fun idea. When we learned about the Animefest competition, harph got slapped around with a muse, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>Q: A sequel maybe?<br/>A: You wish. So much work, who would have time for that. But who knows?</p>\n<p>Q: That was meh, couldn't you give it more effort?<br/>A: Of course we could. Everything can be done better. But we were amateurs in dire time constraints! We think it went pretty well, considering.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the intro movie so late in the game?<br/>A: If you played this type of game before, you know it sometimes is like that. And harph wanted it like that, the tyrant.</p>\n<p>Q: Will there be an English translation?<br/>A: Oh look, this is it! It's 2021 and thanks to mikey (http://atpprojects.mygamesonline.org/) the game is fully translated to English.</p>\r\n5.

Final thoughts from the future (harph, 2021)\r\n<p>Getting back to this fun little project brings back some really nice memories.</p>\n<p>How we were looking for an artist and found one amazing talented recluse who we never met.</p>\n<p>How we transformed my old school short story into a longer text fitting for a VN.</p>\n<p>How I coded all of the game engine and had a blast doing it.</p>\n<p>How I made music in this weird software called EJay Dance by just slamming loops together.</p>\n<p>All in all, nice trip down memory lane for me, and a great experience for (I hope) everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d0120b51f1c9dbdb61f9246b664e71e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["harphield"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
