The investors have a lot riding on you to make it to Gold Ridge. Ride through 5 towns on your way their upgrading your wagon, horse, and gun along the way. Also try endless mode, where you start with the bare minimum and see how long you survive!</p>\n<p>In this infinite runner game, you must dodge and shoot your way between towns. Obstacles and enemies pop up in your way. The Dusty Trail gets more perilous as you go, with faster obstacles and more enemies, so plan your shots and route accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD To move your horse, the wagon will follow close behind.</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys To aim. You can aim in 4 directions, so take time lining up your shot.</p>\n<p>Space Bar To shoot. Your bullet will go in the direction you're aiming.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>When in town, the banker will always give you 100 loot. Use this to get upgrades or heal your wagon and horse. Wagon and horse only go up to level 3, which you should try to get both there as soon as possible. Shooting barrels and crates have a chance to drop loot as well! Not sure about your stats in town, go pet your horse to get all of the details, and walk into your wagon to get back on the dusty trail.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!
