But unlike other similar games, this game is played, 100%, on a Mini Map of the level. The winner of each level is decided by who ever reaches a preset number of kills, which is decided by the Host, first. After a player wins, a new level is loaded up and the cycle continues! When the round starts, weapons will spawn randomly around the map, allowing the first player that touches it, to pick it up. Each weapon has different stats and accessories, some shoot fast, some slow, some have laser sights, and others don't.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Custom Map Support</li><li>\u00a0Built in Map Maker</li><li>\u00a050 built in Maps</li><li>\u00a010 weapons</li><li>\u00a07 Player Colors</li><li>\u00a0Highly Customizable Lobbies</li><li>\u00a0Compatible with Steam Multiplayer</li><li> LAN and Direct IP multiplayer</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0WASD: Moves Player</li><li>\u00a0Left Mouse: Shoots</li><li>\u00a0Mouse: Aims</li><li> Shift: Sprint</li></ul>\r\nMap Maker Controls:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Left Mouse: Places a Tile</li><li>\u00a0Right Mouse: Removes Tile</li><li>\u00a01: Selects Grey Tiles</li><li>\u00a02: Selects Dark Red Tiles</li><li> ESC: Opens Menu</li></ul>\n<strong>Multiplayer:</strong>\n<p>Play with friends through steam,\u00a0 on LAN or by Direct IP, the choice is yours.
