He has been reactivated in an  old facility for an unknown reason and is now searching for his origin.  Along the way, many dangers and puzzles await him, which the player must  avoid or solve in order to reach one of the portals that connect  important points on Earth. We developed the game with Unity, programmed  in C#. At the moment we mainly use freely available assets from the  internet, but as soon as the system works we will create our own. \r\n </p>\n<p>Industry tileset: https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset \r\n </p>\n<p>Pixel art Forest: https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest \r\n </p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<p><strong>Full screen:</strong> Toggle Full screen via Main menu &gt; Options &gt; Full screen(-toggle) or via Unity/Itch.io.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Volume</strong>: Set the <strong>volume</strong> each of the <strong>music</strong> <strong>and</strong> of the <strong>sound effects! \r\n</strong><strong>So you can play with your preferences!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Quality of the graphics (Beta): Change the quality of the game from <strong>Very Low</strong> to <strong>Ultra</strong>!\u00a0 \r\n<strong>Play with your specs!</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Quit (Feedback-button): </strong>If you don't want to play  anymore, you can 'quit' (in the pause-/main menu) and then, you will be  redirected to the feedback-/criticism-/bugreports-topic, <strong>where you can tell us your experience with the game!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We would be so happy, not important whether good or bad experience, but we hope, you have a good experience.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</strong>\n</p>\r\nTo do that, we need <em>your input!</em> Without this, <em>we can can't </em>do big and better things.
