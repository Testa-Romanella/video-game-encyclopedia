It's a demanding gig, but the benefits are great - immortality, mystic powers and a high-fiber diet of mostly insects.<br/><br/>Renfield: Bring Your Own Blood is a single-player adventure that combines the simplicity of one-touch gameplay with frenetic, room-based action for a new roguelite experience. With unique stages, dozens of enemies, diabolical bosses and enough weapons for a bug-powered bloody rampage, Renfield: Bring Your Own Blood shows you the ups and downs of being the lackey/employee of the most demanding boss in history - Dracula.<h3>Battle horrifying and hilarious horrors</h3><br/>Fight, die, and resurrect while you obliterate dozens of enemies and multiple bosses in a visual explosion of style and charm, all inspired by the Universal Pictures film. You're not doing this for your personal glory, you're doing this to feed the boss and maybe get a promotion.<h3>A gore-geous pixelated world</h3><br/>Power through a stylistic version of New Orleans with beautiful environmental objects, collectibles, and branching paths. Your choices will be the difference between career advancement or eternal unemployment.<h3>Even more anarchy and armaments</h3><br/>Level up to be the best lackey/overworked employee. Equip yourself with dozens of upgradable weapons and pest-powered skills to become Dracula's very best (and only) employee. More gear and challenges will come over the next several months so your gameplay will always stay fresh.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-30T01:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/912c5e815b8cf6738f0e321e01634f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 17, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 93, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mega Cat Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skybound Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
