Disc golfers have three different types of \n      discs at their disposal when out on the course: a driver, a mid-range \n      disc, and a putter. Also, there are three different types of throw \n      available: forehand, backhand, and the hammer throw. The forehand and \n      backhand throws change based on the handedness of the player, and can be \n      used to draw or fade a shot, while the hammer throw is less about \n      distance and more about height. At the end of the round, scores are \n      tallied, and the player with the lowest score is the winner.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2be136b147d710a1d746d392103c2fd.jpg", "website": "http://www.hbarcade.com/HBArcadeDiscGolf/discgolf_main.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HB Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
