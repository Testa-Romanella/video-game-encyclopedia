But then you spend another 3 hours to imporve your game and then another final 3 hours to make the final build. And you get three themes to pick from!</p><p>So this game was made in 9 hours total.</p><p>The Web-Version on this page is the end product after 9 hours of work. But in the downloads you can find all three versions.</p><p>Version 1 after 3 hours, Version 2 after 6 hours and the final Version 3 after 9 hours.</p>Snakebomb<p>Snakebomb is my game for the Triple Trijam in 2020.</p><p>Snakebomb is a twist on the classic game of Snake. You eat food to get larger and at some point you run into something and die. But here you don't just die, you explode! Because you are a Snakebomb!</p><p>And your goal is to destroy all ghosts in a level with your explosion.</p><p>Snakebomb features 10 Levels with\u00a0increasing speed and ghost numbers. Can you finish all of them?<br/></p>How to PlayThemes<p>The Triple Trijam has three themes from which you can choose to implement one, two or all three in your game.</p><p>These are the themes for the Triple Trijam 2020 and how I implemented them:</p><ul><li>\u00a0Novel Twist on Classic Game<ul><li>This one pretty obvious as the whole game is a twist on the classic game \"Snake\".</li></ul></li><li>Chain Reaction<ul><li>Chain Reaction is what gave me the idea to have the Snake explode, in a chain reaction.</li></ul></li><li>Negative Feedback Loop<br/><ul><li>Not that directly implemented, but there is a decision to make how long you want to become before you detonate yourself. Getting longer makes the game harder but at the same time makes it easier to hit all ghosts in your explosion.</li></ul></li></ul>Diversifiers<p>Diversifiers are a set of optional challenges.</p><p>Here are the ones I (more or less) completed and that directly affect the game. Visit the Triple Trijam Page (https://itch.io/jam/triple-trijam-2020) to see the whole list.</p><ul><li><strong>Code</strong><br/><ul><li>Upload the source code of your project to your game's itch.io page!<ul><li>The source code is hosted at Github:\u00a0https://github.com/TLochow/Snakebomb</li><li>There are even different branches for each of the three versions, if you are interested:</li><li>Version 1: https://github.com/TLochow/Snakebomb/tree/Version_1</li><li>Version 2: https://github.com/TLochow/Snakebomb/tree/Version_2</li><li>Version 3: https://github.com/TLochow/Snakebomb/tree/Version_3</li></ul></li><li>Make a procedurally-generated game with functionally infinite levels (or an infinitely long level)!<ul><li>Snakebomb features randomly generated levels.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Design</strong><br/><ul><li>Make a game that uses randomness!<ul><li>Randomness is part of the core design of Snakebomb. The game generates random levels, places the ghosts and the player randomly in said level and the cherry-bomb is placed randomly.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Accessibility</strong><br/><ul><li>Make a game that can be understood regardless of what language the player speaks!<ul><li>While this game features english text and the \"How To\" is in english it is also not very complicated and I'm pretty sure even somebody who doesn't understand english can figure the game out pretty quick.</li></ul></li><li>Make a game that can be played with WASD, ZQSD, Arrow Keys, and IJKL!<ul><li>All of these inputs are accepted.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Use a color-blindness filter to test your game's art and make sure it's clear for people with all kinds of color-blindness!<ul><li>I used a filter and also asked a friend of mine with a red-green colorblindness about Snakebomb. We both agree that, while certain sprites appear as the same color (the snake and cherry in his case), all things behave differently enough that the similar looking color is not too much of a problem.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Meta</strong><ul><li>Make a game with a main menu!
