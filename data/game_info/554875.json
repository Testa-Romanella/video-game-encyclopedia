After weeks of relentless pecking, you've broken out of your cage in the chicken battery. You can taste freedom. All that's left is to make it past the guards undetected and find your five friends. However it's not going to be quite that simple...\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou see, the entire game is played on a Nokia 3310 and, well... let's just say it's seen better days (it's 20 years old after all), and it keeps turning itself on and off. The guards can still capture you even if the Nokia is turned off, so make sure to take cover in a safezone before that happens.\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRescue your band of beaky brethren and bolt from the battery before the battery bolts you!\r\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\nNum Pad 1, 2, 3 &amp; 5\r\n  \r\n  \r\nMove\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\nNum Pad 0\r\n  \r\n  \r\nLay an (explosive) egg\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\nEnter\r\n  \r\n  \r\nStart the game\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTips\r\n<p>\r\nKeep your eye on the battery level.
