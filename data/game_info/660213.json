The theme was Rotation, and so my thought went to a level that if you saw it, you could see that the background rotated - the game makes up a full rotation. I don't think I displayed it well, but oh well. This was also my first time working with Game Maker Studio 2. I don't know why the 1-bit style called to me - perhaps I'm just feeling retro.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this short experience. While there are sound effects, I decided to leave it music-less - I tend to play my own music while working and playing. (And, ahem. Sound was... well, there were ISSUES debugging it.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e657964c504587d976bd73eacf4b07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kururuchan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
