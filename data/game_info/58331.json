It is up to you \u2013  if you roam freely, perhaps practicing some kickflips, or if you head directly to the marked waypoints.<br/><br/>All the game\u2019s 5184 areas are procedurally generated. The landscapes early in the game, are reminiscent of NASA\u2019s Apollo program. But, when you reach the far side of the moon, the terrain algorithm gets increasingly out of hand, producing an ethereal topography, suited only for the most experienced of players.<br/><br/>Moon Surfing\u2019s online server keeps track of your progress and the progress of all other players. You will know which areas have been conquered already, and when. All players are in this together.<br/><br/>Privacy notice: the player IDs are randomly generated for each device and are anonymous.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b41bdc3657466e5116ed081b85fc0d5.jpg", "website": "http://www.moon-surfing.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Christian Schnellmann"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Christian Schnellmann"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
