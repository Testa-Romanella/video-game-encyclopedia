Telewar is a 2d singleplayer, fast paced shooting battle between you and a bunch of cloned AI's. For the theme of the game jam I used screen wrapping so that once you exit one side\u00a0 of the screen\u00a0you come out the other. Same thing with the top and bottom screens. This allows for enhanced combat moves. Therefore, the 4 sides of the screen are<strong>\u00a0linked together or joined</strong> (Yes, I Improvised on the theme).<br/></p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Use the A and D keys\u00a0 or the arrow keys\u00a0to move left and right.</p>\n<p>Use the Space bar to Jump.</p>\n<p>Use (Rotate) your mouse to aim the player's gun, and cleft click to fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Your goal is to shoot as many red enemies as possible without dying.</strong></p>\n<p>The more you shoot at them, the more they take action and shoot at you.</p>\r\nCredits:\u00a0\r\n<p>All art was made by me.</p>\n<p>The Music is the <em>Toon Battle Soundtrack</em>\u00a0 by TFSui\u00a0and\u00a0I downloaded it from the Unity Asset Store. -\u00a0\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/toon-battle-soundtrack-60676</p>\n<p>Sound Effects were obtained from the <em>Wowie Resource Pack</em> made by Jonas Tyroller. -\u00a0https://jonas-tyroller.itch.io/wowie-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25586a82926cae822f051332fb91ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MigDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
