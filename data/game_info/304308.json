The world exploration, search of alien artifacts, gathering and development of a unique team as well as battles in space and on the ground are waiting for you.<br/><br/>You are a squad leader, working for the galactic commercial rescue service. It\u2019s up to you to decide where to go and whose distress signal to take: you can protect the colonists\u2019 ships from the attack of space cannibals or defend merchants from pirate raids, save the settlers\u2019 colony from biological threat or neutralize the AI gone out of control, dig out the asteroids or travel to the limits known space to discover new galaxy mysteries.<br/><br/>It depends on you how the story will develop, who will be your customer and how exactly will the open sector of galaxy change. SOS is a familiar fantasy in a new form, it combines freedom of actions, an extensive plot, interstellar flights as well as ground tactical operations.<br/><br/>The combat system consists of two turn-based types of fights, one takes place between spaceships on the star clusters background and the second suggest the sensitive guidance of each squad unit. During the game you will have to make difficult choices: to control several ships in battle or to slip quietly on one assault spaceboat, to get through the intricate corridors to silently disarm the enemy or launch an attack head-on right from the start of a level.<br/><br/> <br/><strong>At this stage alpha-version of project includes:</strong><br/><ul><li>Three-dimensional environment in the Sci-Fi Style<br/></li><li>Upgrading and development of squad members<br/></li><li>Ability to assemble a fleet of spaceships<br/></li><li>Turn-based tactical battles on ground and in space<br/></li><li>Upgrading ships and customization of their appearance<br/></li><li>Customization of team\u2019s armor and weapons<br/></li><li>Diverse factions with their own history, mission and features<br/></li><li>Opponents combining different combat styles<br/></li><li>Classes, skills, modules, properties, combinations, effects, ratings, and other elements of a tactical turn-based strategy!</li></ul> <br/><br/>\u201cWe ask the captain to come aboard, the cosmic adventures begin!\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/042bf1e1ed57fb176059ee2537ef0390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rummy Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MV Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
