The game starts after Francisco Madero has assumed the presidency of Mexico. You play as Madero, and you must avoid being shot by your generals, ousted by rebels, or overrun by the United States. Keeping Mexico out of WWI would also help. To win, you must ratify a new constitution that solidifies the goals of the revolution: land reform, term limits, secular education, and complete sovereignty over Mexico\u2019s mineral resources.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is an attempt to raise the profile of the Mexican Revolution a bit.\u00a0   </p>\n<p>The Mexican Revolution is one of the more interesting conflicts of the 20th Century, but it really does not get the attention that it deserves.\u00a0 This is most likely because it overlapped with the Communist revolution in Russia.\u00a0 The two conflicts are actually quite similar.\u00a0 \u00a0Both revolutions involved violent regime change that ultimately ended in one party rule, the PRI in Mexico and the Communist Party in Russia.\u00a0 Both of these regimes held onto power into the 1990s without any real challenges or opposition.\u00a0 Finally, the US intervened militarily in both revolutions.\u00a0   </p>\n<p>The big difference is that Russia became the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union pointed nuclear weapons at the US, so the Russian Revolution gets a lot of attention.\u00a0 The fact that the Russian Revolution also altered the course of a world war also helps keep the Russian Revolution in the spotlight.\u00a0 Finally, the Russian Revolution has an amazing cast of characters.\u00a0 You can\u2019t really compete with Rasputin, Lenin, or a murdered royal family.\u00a0 To Americans, the Russian Revolution is a Sunday night HBO scripted drama, with Al Pacino playing Trotsky.\u00a0 In the American popular imagination, the Mexican Revolution is a BBC costume drama, with Benedict Cumberbatch playing Pancho Villa (Villa was actually a pretty low-key guy.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t swear or drink).\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:59:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca35ee48234cdc2a391434c605123d49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
