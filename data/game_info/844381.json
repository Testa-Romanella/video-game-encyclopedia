At the same time, the tracks will have various traps that you can control to add to the chaos and influence the race.<br/><br/><strong>Each racer is a real person!</strong> Your audience can join through their mobile device (with our companion app), or via the chat interface. The racers get to customize their car, boost with nitro, charge the traps and do other things to be seen.
