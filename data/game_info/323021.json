Specifically about my habit of pressing the snooze button when the alarm goes off. I hope I'm not the only one going through this.\r\n\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!\u00a0Please feel free to share it with other who share the same feelings. If you'd like to see a physical version of it, please let me know and I'll make it printable!\r\nAny feedback is welcome!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T05:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d51b3f40f7d4530a6a92b643caa150c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsNemo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
