Due to some technical difficulties with our Unity Collab files (hate how they made them small as hell for free users...), we lost the files for what I had made and only had the gameplay itself, but luckily I do have a build of my work from before this happened. It isn't playable, but I'm proud of my work on this one, I did a lot of stuff I never expected to do, I got to experiment, and I have some cool stuff to show off.<br/><br/>NOTE: The .zip file attached to this project contains both the Windows and Mac versions of the game, but only the Mac version has both the files needed to play it. Also the Mac version is the only one that has my work in it, the Windows version was made after we lost my project files.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf8a77237cef090b29d9e62b9fe95ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CabooseNomerson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
