This puzzle game is inspired by a board game, Master Mind, invented in 1970. You have 13 chances to guess the correct sequence of colored cells to open each door on your way to escape. There are six different colored cells to choose from and the same color can be used twice. The correct sequence is totally random therefor no two games will be solved the same. The system gives you clues to let you know if you have cells in the correct sequence and if you have the correct color but the wrong sequence, however you will not know what cells are correct or which are out of order. To make things a little more pressing you only have so much air or time to figure out the sequence before you suffocate.</p>\n<p>At this time there are virtually 40 levels but I have not created the ending yet.</p>\n<p>Any input would be great. I am working on saving where you left off.</p>\n<p>If you like puzzles I hope you will like trying to solve this one.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1996fe3f2f3f3113d5686c3f06d35e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dlgcreations"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
