Gravity pulls all the orbs down but the player has a great power - he or she can transfer directionless momentum across the orbs! Bouncy floors, antigravity antics, gravity warpers that want to be black holes, big orbs, little orbs, intractable orbs and stubborn orbs - play Momentum, a game of puzzle solving moments! Save who you can, the red orb is your favorite, enjoy the sweet jams, and -above all else- press \"r\" to restart.</p>CREDITS<p>Director: Jackson Ekis</p><p>Lead Designer and Programmer: Zach Danz</p><p>Senior Programmer: Thomas Sparks</p><p>Programmers and Level Designers: Trad Goover, Reid Bixler, and Liam Dwyer</p><p>Music: Raymond Zhao</p>CONTROLS<p>click - select<br/></p><p><strong>left/right - navigate worlds in level select screen</strong><br/></p><p>space - toggle pause</p><p>r - restart level</p><p>ESC - toggle in-game menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/6527c793baa9851b09f9dc2d577dc834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Zachary Danz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
