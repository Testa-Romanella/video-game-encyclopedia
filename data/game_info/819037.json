The rules are simple - survive for as long as you can.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is a turn-based strategy game where each decision you make comes with a price. Will you be able to challenge your enemies without shooting yourself in the foot?</p>\n\n<p>The game consists of a duel between two characters, each containing a set of cards they can pick from. Each turn 8 random cards from each of the players are displayed and the 6-sided dice of current player is rolled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are presented with the cards at the position of the number in the dice (a 4 means the player sees the 4th card from both you and the enemy). You now have choice - you pick a card to play against your enemy, while the other card is played against you! When a card is picked, both cards are consumed along with all cards before the number picked - this means that if you pick the card at position 4, for the next turn the cards at position 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 are discarded and a new list is generated, putting the then 5th card at the beginning and filling out the rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For each enemy you have 5 Rerolls available.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d0cfde1e51974ee861ed692cb7da0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Lotosos"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
