Instructions on how to play can be found ingame.</p><p><strong>How the Tagging works:</strong></p><p>The job description that the player receives has two components. The first is a randomly selected tag, the second is a randomly generated year range. The player is told to only steal images that match both criteria.</p><p>The player sees if the image matches the tag but can not see the year it was made. To reveal the year he must get close to the image and scan it. By tracking which images the player looks at and scans the game tags the images. </p><p>Example:</p><p>Mission: Find art with people on it from the years 1914 to 1954.</p><p>The player will ignore all images that have no people on it. So the game tags all images that the player passes but doesn't scan as \"NOT People\". Each image the player scans will be tagged as \"People\".</p><p>When the player steals an artwork the game can only verify one of the criteria, but since the player doesn't know that he will try to match both, giving us the information if the images matches the tag or not.</p><p>Art Treachery source code is available on Github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85c/85c9feaecd03c88f62e28931ddcc43a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Headmade Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
