To learn to control these powers they are sent to Military Academies where they learn to use these skills as well as put them to use. Although there are several Academies spread around the world, seven stand out among them, being the largest and reference in the world, powerful enough to have the status of even sovereign and independent nations, among them the Insolita Academy, where the story takes place.</p>\n<p>In this game you take on the role of one of the students at Academia Insolita, as a newly accepted recruit at the Academy, you'll face challenges both from school life, such as tests, physical exams, relationships with your friends, as well as dangerous missions that include battles against monsters, wars between nations, mysterious conspiracies and a mysterious shadowy figure that appears in your dreams...</p>\r\nPremise\r\n<p>The game is divided into two major forms, which are the school period and the time of the mission.</p>\n<em>School term:</em>\n<p>During school term you will control Alec during his day to day life at the Academy. During lessons you may be asked to answer questions. If you answer them correctly, you will receive Study Points, which symbolize your school development in the game. There will also be tests where several of the subjects and lived experiences may appear.</p>\n<p>After classes there will always be a 'Free Time' option, which you can choose what to do with the rest of the day. Among the options is to strengthen your friendship with the members of your group. By spending enough time with them you will receive Friendship Points with them, and by raising the friendship level your colleagues will be able to awaken abilities and acquire unique statuses, not accessible in any other way.</p>\n<p>Another way to spend your free time is at the library reading a book. Through books you can increase Alec's attribute points (such as ATK or DEF), learn more about systems and the game universe, consequently increasing your study points, discover an item that can be added, as a result, the game stores or even learn some exclusive technique, which cannot be acquired by leveling up.</p>\n<p>In addition, throughout the game, secondary missions, single events that can be achieved according to your choices and conversations will be made available, among several other ways to spend your day.</p>\n<strong><em>Missions:</em></strong>\n<p>During the mission period you will have to fulfill a certain objective. Like a typical JRPG you'll explore locations, talk to people and defeat enemies. In Insolita, however, be aware of the answers you'll give because, even though there's only one goal in the end, you'll be able to reach it in different ways and some choices can affect the difficulty of the game, generate unique dialogues and interactions, provide you with items that won't be acquired elsewhere and even unlock side quests involving different characters that could play an important role in the future...</p>\r\nLanguage\r\n<p>At this time, only the Portuguese version (PT-BR) is available for download. English version coming soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T13:30:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/935772e576e0e788ce4f7f39ca40d908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafael_lobo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
