You have crash landed on a strange world and can make weapons out of the pasta you find there. I rushed to submit it to JamCraft5 with 1 minute remaining, so there are some bugs. Notably, your melee weapon disappears if you shoot with no ammo with the melee weapon equipped. I'll update later to fix these things and add in a few more features to use my unused animations. <br/></p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p>D - Right</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>J - Melee; Open Chests<br/></p>\n<p>K - Ranged</p>\n<p>P - Crafting Menu</p>\n<p>Mouse - Crafting Menu Navigation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58eb14f87b14582750d21f64d25b8e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["futebutesiku"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
