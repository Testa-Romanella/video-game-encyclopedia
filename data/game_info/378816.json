This is a kinetic novel made for fun, there has also been made a short movie (School Project) about the story\u00a0back in 2017. This is a my first visual novel in Ren'Py I tried my best. I highly recommend downloading the game for optimal experience. ^_^</p><p>Average read ~20 min.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>A game created/written\u00a0by Nikita</li><li>Grammar corrected by Patrick</li><li>Orignial script by Magnus</li></ul>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<ul><li>Nikita</li><li>Abdi</li><li>Stock photos from\u00a0www.dreamstime.com</li><li>Google</li></ul>\n<p>Music:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sora The Troll:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/user-265680042/i-dont-have-a-life</li><li>Cantina band - John Williams</li><li>Sound effects are homemade</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/5164edd02bc82b7d2573639d8b107501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Minenik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
