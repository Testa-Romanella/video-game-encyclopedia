After the last game of the series was published in 1996, reimagining the established format as a first-person shooter, the game was brought back to its roots, returning not only with the improved graphics, engine, and design but with the classic top-down shoot \u2018em up genre. Theodore J. Conrad is a space engineer that has to restore the engines after the collision with a mysterious empty ship.<br />\nAlien Breed: Impact is an updated version of Alien Breed: Evolution that adds not only new designs for the enemy aliens but an entirely new upgrade shop. It has two full story campaigns for both single player and multiplayer. In the multiplayer cooperative campaign, two players are taking the roles of two other survivors, Thadeus and Eddie, that are trying to find Conrad and assist him on his mission.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2010-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T00:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e9290d51aa334b846c791cde16f5b5f.jpg", "website": "http://www.team17.com", "rating": 2.91, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 102, "owned": 1621, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 25, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 75, "suggestions_count": 603, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
