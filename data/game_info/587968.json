Each scorpion only has one weapon. Upon death, the player/scorpion can revive as another of the seven... as, thus, use a new weapon.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>BASIC Controls...</strong></p>\n<p>W-A-S-D - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump/Revive</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Fire</p>\n<p>Escape - Quit<br/></p>\n<p>---</p><p>The idea for this game is very loosely based on\u00a0Isis and the Seven Scorpions. As much as I tried, only two \"scorpions\" (player character) made it in the game in the form of weapons.<br/></p><p>---<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Godot Wild Jam #32. I attempted to make something I've never tried before... a FSP. I'm not very skilled in 3D game development and, while I tried to keep things simple, most things still did not make it into the game, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Please accept this game for what it is... a first attempt at trying a new skill set during a game jam.</p>\n<p>Thank you!<br/>- ObsidianBlk<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:19:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/497/497098f0622c945665b181dcc7024e07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
