I didn't decide to do the theme which was \"reusable\" (but you could say the car runs on reusable energy)<br/></p><p>Game designed and programmed by John Macca and music made by Romello Moss</p><p>3D models from cgtrader and turbosquid\u00a0</p><p>In the game you are texting while driving and while you are texting the car keeps on moving and you are going to crash into whatever is in front of you. Everytime you successfully type out the words the you loom up from your phone for a brief moment to be able to move the car out of the way of whatever is in front of you, but if the car crashes into something you lose. So the game is somewhat educational as well because not only does it teach fast typing but also the dangers of texting while driving.</p><p>The object of the game is to type as many words as possible without crashing, and as the game progresses the harder the words get and the faster the car moves.\u00a0</p><p>Post your High Score in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e386aff39d1daba764c8e52f76d6e7fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Macca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
