The idea came when we first heard the theme for the 2021 GMTK \"Joined Together\". As our team is composed of friends living in different parts of the world, as most of our team live in Brazil where the pandemic is still not controlled it seemed obvious where we wanted this game to be. Every character in the game represents one of us! we even decided to record our instruments and compose the music for the game. We had a lot of fun developing this game and we hope you all find this game an interesting experience.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>-WASD to move your character around\r\n<br/>-\"E\" to interact with the NPC\r\n<br/>-Move close to the PC to go into the game map\r\n<br/>-Move close to the bed to sleep after a day gaming\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66dacc2749c00b5a8580a16eecae4f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Destroyall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
