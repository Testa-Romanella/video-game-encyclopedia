Wrongly accused of demolition, CC-37 must confront these villains in order for him to clear his name. During his journey he can complete missions for the local friendly droids to obtain valuable items or information, making it possible for CC-37 to uncover secrets that have long been hidden underneath rust and dust. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe journey decisions are yours to make. Do you want to attempt to get a high rank by finding all the secrets or would you like to skip quests and try to set the fastest speed run record? The game offers players multiple ways and play styles to finish the story. Obtaining higher ranks will unlock more bonus content. The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse or a joystick. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n**This game features a photo-mode (press P / Start) where it is possible to hide the user interface, control time and weather and apply a depth of field effect for making nice screenshots. While it is possible, it is not recommended to play the entire game in photo-mode. See in game control options for more info.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you like the music, you can listen to it again via the music player in the main menu, or check it out on Spotify : Rust 'n Dust - album by Jelle Dittmar<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(Rust And Dust - Full Playthrough (Version 0.99) - YouTube)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSAE Student project 2021 <br/>\r\n(SAE Institute Amsterdam)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3 months time <br/>\r\n7 game students <br/>\r\n2 alumni<br/>\r\n5 audio students <br/>\r\n1 programmer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Game Department -<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLilla Balazs<br/>\r\nDennis Boersma<br/>\r\nFemke Harberts<br/>\r\nRobin Keiman<br/>\r\n\u017dan Kunej<br/>\r\nMihai Lungu<br/>\r\nDavid Mkrtchyan<br/>\r\nJulia Schlotter<br/>\r\nRemon Ploeg<br/>\r\nEri Carrillo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Audio Department - <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAgnar Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Halld\u00f3rsson<br/>\r\nJelle Dittmar<br/>\r\nWilliam Hatfield<br/>\r\nEamonn Nolan<br/>\r\nHrafn Posocco", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/add55b9397f7dcd6b61b78d70068ee74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 501, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dennis Boersma", "Covid Cowboys"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Covid Cowboys"], "esrb_rating": null}
