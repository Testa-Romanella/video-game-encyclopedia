Played out like a futuristic sport, the playing field is a large rectangle made out of squares. A Plasmorb ball must be moved into a goal as many times as possible within the course of three minutes. This is accomplished by using a Rotofoil vehicle. This game even allows Rotofoils to race against each other (basically a normal game but without the ball).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c52dd6022b70b3eac82539547048571.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Rainbow Arts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
