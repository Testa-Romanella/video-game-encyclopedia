If you don't like where you've ended up, you can backtrack to previous nodes and try a different path. <br/></p>\n<p>You can use the map to plot cities or planets in a story, or zoom out a bit and use it to draw a shape, or just click away and see where it takes you. Apologies for the extremely rudimentary name generation, I threw it together in a few minutes.<br/></p>\r\nControl notes\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD </strong>move the camera around </li><li><strong>Left click</strong> selects the next node, and centres that node in the camera</li><li><strong>Mouse scroll</strong> (or\u00a0<strong>J/K</strong>) zooms in and out</li><li><strong>N </strong>shows/hides node names</li><li><strong>M </strong>shows/hides the signature/title in the bottom corner</li><li><strong>Right click/'Save image as' </strong>allows you to save a snapshot of what you've done directly from the browser (of course you could take a normal screenshot instead)</li><li><strong>Spacebar </strong>shows/hides debug information but there's not much interesting there</li></ul>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>I'm super pleased with this one. It's another step towards feeling like I can just build stuff <em>myself</em> in the browser, rather than needing libraries to do so much of it. I like building stuff! I've basically been carrying forward some general-use functionality like update/draw loops and other utilities through these few JS games I've made, and it feels like despite their very basic looks I am getting more competent at putting what I want onscreen using just plain JavaScript. Which is cool!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy a long drive of your own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>#onegameamonth January 2020<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T05:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f3/2f3ca8f4b1291a6e0b84adebcfdd3509.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
