However, she suddenly found out that she seemed to be trapped in this castle. Just as the girl looked for ways to get out of here, she found that she didn't seem to be the only one who came in here...<br/><br/>This castle once belonged to the famous Duke Shewell's family, and it is said that the people in this castle suddenly disappeared a hundred years ago. It is time for you to unlock the hidden secret in this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this game, the character you operate is Hinata, a normal school girl. <br/><br/><br/>(You can see the game trailer and those screenshots.)<br/><br/>Besides Hinata, there are two more characters in this game, and you have to find out them by yourself. Because they are part of this story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is a single player adventure game. All you have to do is to explore the castle, solve various kinds of puzzles, and follow the storyline. It is not particularly a horrific game, and some puzzles are somehow a little bit challenging. So I'm hoping you will enjoy the process of solving puzzles, and also enjoy the story of RICA.<br/><br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Moving: \u2191 \u2193 \u2190 \u2192 ,<br/>Dash: Shift,<br/>Menu: X, Esc,<br/>Enter: Z, Space, Enter,<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game contains two endings, a normal ending and a true ending.<br/>Both endings take the same amount of time to achieve.<br/><br/>Normally it will take you 2 hours to complete one ending, but once you finish it, it will take you less amount of time to finish it again.<br/><br/>The BGM in this game is composed by Seldom Ludious, so please do not republish it to somewhere else.<br/><br/>And finally, hope you guys will enjoy it!!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba044268d2f8795a2c712bf3c3520be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seldom Ludious"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seldom Ludious"], "esrb_rating": null}
