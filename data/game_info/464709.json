It's your power - they're all after it. You build towers to defend yourself, but even they will turn on you eventually. Perhaps the only way to win was to never play in the first place...</p>\n<p>This game is just like any other tower defense game. You buy towers, defend your base from alarmingly cute enemies, and then deal with an uprising within your own ranks as your towers lose respect for your orders.</p>\n<p>Wait, what was that last one?</p><p>Note: there were meant to be 2 more types of towers on top of the Grunt and the Enforcer (I forgot to put their names in the shop, whoops), but I ran out of time. I feel like the game lacks a certain depth and chaos without them, but I hope I was still able to get across the general concept- a story about the collapse of a regime told mainly through the mechanics of a tower defense game .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1fd2ccabc54a0fbaea18f384f0d4452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MsJofish"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
