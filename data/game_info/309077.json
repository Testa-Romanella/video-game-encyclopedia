{"id": 309077, "slug": "hibernator", "name": "Hibernator", "name_original": "Hibernator", "description": "<p>This is a test drive of the L\u00d6VE framework that I went a bit overboard with. Collect the seven foodstuffs scattered throughout the maze-like game world. Once all are in your possession, return to your den to prep for hibernation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys, WASD</strong>: Walk, jump, climb, activate machines.<br/><strong>R</strong>: Restart from the last checkpoint.<br/><strong>Tab</strong>: Display the automap. All visited screens will be shown, and all food locations will also be indicated.<br/><strong>F2</strong>: Return to the title screen (restarts the application)<br/><strong>Escape</strong>: Open the options menu. Use up/down or W/S to select an option, left/right or A/D to adjust a numeric parameter, and Enter to toggle an On-or-Off parameter. Press Escape to leave the menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong></p>\n<p>In order to progress, you'll need to pick up coins to activate moving\r\nplatforms, and also increase your jump strength by collecting new sneakers,\r\njust as in nature.</p>\n<p>Checkpoints are represented as torches. When defeated by the bad things,\r\nyou will be returned to the last torch with all progress since then undone.\r\nYou can touch the same torch twice to update the restore point with new stats.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, you will have to deal with swimming. You float\r\nupwards to the surface, and the only way to move further downwards underwater is to\r\nhave jumped in from a sufficiently high point. To leave water, hold the jump button to continuously hop out. It's not possible to drown in this game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Menu Options That Warrant Explanation</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Screen Scale</strong>: Magnifies the screen. Lower is smaller.<br/><strong>Time Scale</strong>: Changes the speed of gameplay. Lower is faster.<br/><strong>Vsync</strong>: When enabled, synchronizes draw updates to the refresh rate of your monitor or television. When disabled, the game renders at a rate as fast as your system and L\u00d6VE will allow, which may cause screen tearing artifacts.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>System Requirements</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In general: your system needs to support L\u00d6VE 11.2 to play this game. A 32-bit Windows package is provided below, as well as the <em>.love</em> project file which can be used with the Linux and MacOS versions of L\u00d6VE. Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to a MacOS system for testing and packaging a standalone Mac release. I intend to resolve this at some point in the future, and also intend to make a Linux AppImage or similar all-in-one package as well.<br/></p>\n<p>I tested the Windows package on an old HTPC with an AMD A6-6400K\u00a0running Windows 10, and experienced substantial frame drops while Vsync was enabled. Disabling Vsync seemed to clear up most issues.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Things that aren't supported because I didn't manage my time well enough but<br/>will be in the next game I swear</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Gamepad input, key rebinding, fullscreen, and saving and loading the game<br/>to/from disk are conspicuously absent. I apologize for any issues this causes.<br/>If there is demand, I can try and patch them in. Given these absences, I'm leaving the Itch project status for this as 'Prototype.' I will be refactoring the core and adding these things in for future projects as my next action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made in 2019 by Rabbitboots<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.rabbitboots.com/</p>\n<p>Using the L\u00d6VE 2D Engine / Framework, version 11.2<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Tools used:<br/>Ad Lib Tracker II<br/>Audacity<br/>Gedit<br/>GraphicsGale<br/>MilkyTracker<br/>Pillow<br/>Tiled<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/>v1.01 - 8 Apr 2019 - Fix \"S\" not working to activate machines.
