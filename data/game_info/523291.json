Me and my team have been successful in creating a game we were all happy with, there is definitley more we would have liked to do with the game but timing limited our ability. I am not typically a coding person but I thought I would challenge myself on this Jam and be the main coder, I found it to be hard at times but with help from others I managed to wrap my head around the code and managed to produce a simple fun game. !! You may run into the 3 objects all at once giving you no escape, im very sorry, I tried to fix it but\u00a0 I had no idea how !! Thanks for playing the game, leave any feedback so we can improve on the next jam. <br/></p>\n<p>My social: https://twitter.com/TobyKershawCGD<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c393d5e44bfd99dbda8239ef2dd0469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TobyKershaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
