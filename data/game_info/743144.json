Even back then I knew it wasn't very good but it wasn't really\u00a0meant to be. It was just something I made to improve my skills. Unfortunately 5 years later I'm old enough to go back and cringe at what I made back then but I can't say that I've improved since then, though admittedly this is mostly through lack of trying. I tried to get back into \"game development\" recently but I found that after years of not using RPG maker I didn't really know where to start. I pride myself on writing stories well (this game being an exception) and having many great ideas for games but my skills and motivation to sit down and code a game (even one as simple as an RPG maker game) is sadly lacking.</p>\n<p>All this is to say, in fewer words, that I decided instead of creating a new bad game I may as well put this one to good use and give people something to make of, (don't feel bad about it, I'm laughing along with you) so here it is!</p>\n<p>In what was meant to be the first part of a series, the \"richest man in the world\" Appollo Moon is found murdered in his home, so his widow calls upon the help of the world famous detective Sherlock Holmes (that's you!) to solve the case.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/8594198a846365642398ac84b63ba264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garry Found"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
