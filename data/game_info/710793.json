Your goal is to activate the portal in order to escape. On the way there you have to prove yourself against different enemies like hunger, wolves or dangerous diseases. Can you do it? Can you survive? Try it now!</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The game is currently in beta. There are several known issues, for example behaviour of animals, hit detection when interacting with animals or issues with the UI. The project was a student project which has already been completed in relation to the university. It is not yet clear whether the project will continue to be worked on in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art Department:</p>\n<p>- Theresa Bek</p>\n<p>- Tim Gerber\u00a0LinkedIn</p>\n<p>VFX Department:</p>\n<p>- C\u00e9line Perauer</p>\n<p>- Marc Sacco</p>\n<p>Programming Department</p>\n<p>- Louis Schmidberger\u00a0LinkedIn</p>\n<p>- Denise Osterloh</p>\n<p>Sound Department</p>\n<p>- Kilian Balling</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef833490e30796741f2757aeddcb2da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 321, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Louis Schmidberger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
