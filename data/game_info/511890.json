There's no such thing as bad press, right?</p>\n<p>Important note:</p>\n<p>- This is a <em>narrative</em> idle game. That means that,\u00a0unlike other idle games, this game does not have an 'infinite' mode that you can play forever and/or reset with additional bonuses. And unlike many idle games, this game is telling a story that has a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>Also - There are some weird issues with short sounds not loading/playing immediately in the WebGL version of the game right now. If it really REALLY bothers you, well, the mobile versions' sound works great!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07603d5da74457e5d8d51a636e987b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
