On regular base robots are spawning and want to reach a certain floor. You can control the cabin of the lift. With a simple click it will halt at the closest floor. Then robots can leave and enter the cabin. So you are actually the liftboy (or girl).</p>\n<p>You will get points based on how fast a robot reaches his floor. Robots won't wait forever. If it takes too long then you will loose points.</p>\n<p>The game comes with several levels (also endless ones) plus an interactive tutorial.</p>\n<p>Liftboy is completley free and without any ads or analytis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are interessted in what I'm doing at the moment (of course game related) then you can follow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/tomate_salat<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:31:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc1b840f3ed91e591e73488e9df3b143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
