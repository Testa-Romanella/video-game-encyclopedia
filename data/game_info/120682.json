Each player takes a side : Germans use the keyboard; Great Britain uses the mouse and buttons. Playing involves you sending waves of soldiers across no man's land and employing countermeasures to combat enemy assaults. Each side has two machine guns, to kill soldiers crossing the field, although this is not always enough.</p><p>Controls : <br/></p><p>- ANZACs/Sturmtruppen : Quicker than BEF, but more expensive(1st button for britain, 2 for germany, 100 points) <br/> <br/>- BEF/Landwehr : Basic unit, slow but plentiful (2nd button for britain, 1 for germany, 50 points) <br/> <br/>- Artillery : call in some shells on the enemy position (3rd button for britain, 3 for germany, 150 points) <br/> <br/>- Gas : shell with gas clouds across the enemy frontline ! (4th button for britain, 4 for germany, 200 points) <br/> <br/>- Escape exits during and after the game <br/> <br/>Audio on and off should be clear <br/> <br/>Once 100 soldiers have crossed the a side, the other side wins. But was it really worth it? </p><p> <br/> If this game doesn't work, try running it in windows xp sp3 compatibility mode. Updates are planned in the future for performance problems.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d373a3ec6b74353e4d7f620ceca2720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gigaraptor"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
