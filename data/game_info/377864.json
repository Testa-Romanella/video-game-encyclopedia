{"id": 377864, "slug": "necrofugitive", "name": "Necrofugitive", "name_original": "Necrofugitive", "description": "<p>Gameplay in Necrofugitive is focused on replicating the feeling of being hunted and on the run. This means if you are captured or killed, you are down for good. Enemies will patrol the world looking for you, and you only have one life, so make it count!<br />\nClaws, tendrils, armblades, and even disguises are in your shapeshifting arsenal to assist you in your escape. Survive long enough, and you gain the opportunity to fight back with tremendous power - the Prisoner has a unique ability to violently morph into a very powerful monster - the Slaughter Demon, a frighteningly powerful creature with the ability to massacre entire armies!<br />\nExtra focus is being placed on making enemies with intelligent and  aggressive AI. There is a very high bounty placed on the prisoner\u2019s head, and there are  merciless bounty hunters and mercenaries roaming the world, eager to collect. AI enemies have the ability to platform just as well as  a player can. Wherever you go, enemies can follow.<br />\nNecrofugitive will also feature a highly customizable skill tree that allows you to adapt your playstyle in between stages. You have the option of choosing between many different branches, from a silent but lethal shadow crawler or an all out killing machine focused on leaving the messiest possible remains of your enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-04T12:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba94046397a7e4d4ab82d265a757fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Black Garden Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Garden Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
