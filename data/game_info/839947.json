So catch many, you get extra points if you use your tongue (click and hold near the flies) but watch out, you can't count on your tongue working sometimes it's on the fritz that's all part of the frog struggle. So RIBBIT and whatnot, get the flies before your rival gets em cos he's hungry. USE WASD to move and mouse aim / click - hold to tongue if it's working in that level, it's kinda random.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e150493a9199fe4956c350a5489d4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stiggzz22"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
