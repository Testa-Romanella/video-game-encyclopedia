It was later ported to a wide variety of consoles, including the Sega Master System. The player controls a sentient spaceship named Opa-Opa who fights an enemy invasion in the titular group of planets. The game contains a number of features atypical of the traditional scrolling shooter. The main character, Opa-Opa, is sometimes referred to as Sega's first mascot character. The game design and main character had many similarities to the earlier TwinBee, and together the games are credited with the creation of the \"cute 'em up\" subgenre. Numerous sequels were made over the years. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T10:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227b7ae15676daa387de25dcf7c164f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Wii", "SEGA Saturn", "SEGA Master System", "Nintendo 3DS", "NES"], "developers": ["SEGA", "SunSoft", "Pixel", "Bits Laboratory", "GRC"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Tec Toy", "Sunsoft", "PAL", "BRA", "Japan", "NEC", "GRC"], "esrb_rating": null}
