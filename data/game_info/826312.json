For the realization of this project I used my free time that I had to improve my knowledge on Unity and the development of video games. I am proud to present you this little project.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is based on simple mechanics but it will surprise you with its difficulty. You can approach this game in two ways.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ol><li>First, you can try to create the best time to compete against the time of other players. Although there is only one level in the game, you will have to start over several times because it hard to master to rocket.\u00a0<br/><br/>If your goal is to be the fastest, you don't need to go into the vaults.</li><li>Secondly, there are a lot of rooms in the level with clues to find the answer to the riddle. If you try to find it you will have to break your head very hard to get it. The answers are not only in the game. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0//You can bind the key you want to any action in option menu. //</li></ol>\n\n<p>\u00a0Item\u00a0 1 :\u00a0 Select Weapon // Attack<br/>\u00a0Item\u00a0\u00a02 :\u00a0 Pick //\u00a0To collect Eth<br/>\u00a0Item\u00a0 3 : Harvester //\u00a0To collect Fuel</p>\n<ol><li>When you harvest a resource you must bring it to the rocket.</li><li>When you are out of your rocket, the oxygen will decrease. It is important to return before you are completely empty.\u00a0</li><li>There are several platforms throughout the game level. These are checkpoints that will allow you to recover when you crash or die from lack of air.\u00a0</li><li>You should avoid anything that looks dangerous. If you touch them, it's instant death.\u00a0</li><li>Watch out for gas cans. They can explode if you shoot them.</li><li>Take your time and have fun!</li></ol>\n<p>If you enjoyed playing my game and you want to support me, you can make a donation through hitch.io or you can send me your contribution through ETH, BTC or ADA.</p>\n<p>ETH : 0xf87a07d07694629393f89cc7058548d917fb6047<br/>BTC :\u00a0 3CjvxBuztzpQrZ7D47QLMVRM6YG4RDehp1<br/>ADA:\u00a0addr1qy8wv4m7eeq0tnfuy4p3yfgkj274gx5pksjexef0lt5f5mw2ghy505dlvqphnmk2fw5ta9rx7j2ct4gfj4ut4n8erslqhwktvh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cf6a369e25873991d786adae515a123.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black-turn"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
