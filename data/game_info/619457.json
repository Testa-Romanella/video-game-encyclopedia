You are trying to fix one of the servers that is faulty, and it keeps shutting off your friend.\u00a0There is this room that has a computer, and a robot arm. The robot arm has a connected tablet that you can control. The computer can be controlled by the robot arm and can give you speed, jump power, and\u00a0reveal the final platform. The computer can also control you, so use the tablet wisely! All you have to do is touch a button on the back of him (by running into him). He is in the server room.\u00a0Good luck, and help your friend!</p>\r\nTheme Connection\r\n<p>This game fits the theme Joined Together because:</p>\n<ol><li>The computer, the robot arm, and the tablet are Joined Together.</li><li>You have to Join Together the wires to unlock certain things.</li><li>You have to make the robot Join Together with his friend.</li></ol>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The controls for the game are:</p>\n<p>D - Right</p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>E - Open Tablet<br/></p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p><strong>Some of the wires might be on the same side, so be careful not to waste all your wires looking for one on the opposite side.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Some of the platforms may not be of use and just a waste of time. ; )<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>If the level is impossible to complete, and you click a wire, it will auto-restart the level for you!</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Made by</strong>: The Gamestormers Group</p>\n<p><strong>Made with</strong>: Pygame</p>\n<p><strong>Music from</strong>:\u00a0fesliyanstudios.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:47:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee1cabf2d62f38c41e796f062ebfa40f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uberBuilder24"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
