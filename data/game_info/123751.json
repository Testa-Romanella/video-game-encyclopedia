{"id": 123751, "slug": "summoned", "name": "Summoned", "name_original": "Summoned", "description": "<p>You ever get tired of dealing with bullshit?<em>\u00a0</em>How about other people's bullshit? Actually, don't you just get tired of other people? Because you'd definitely start\u00a0if <em>all</em> your interactions with them suddenly came down to \"Hey, I need you to do some fucking shit I\u00a0don't wanna do.\"</p>\n<p>My name's Flin Paltwell, and this is the story about how I got forced into helping random people deal with that awful, whirling maelstrom of bullshit we all like to call \"Life.\" See, I had one of those not too long ago. A life, I mean. I had a house, a job,\u00a0 a plan, and a girlfriend whom I'd still very much like to marry.</p>\n<p>Then I, you know, FUCKING DIED, discovered that <em>demons</em> were apparently real, and got offered the chance to come back to life by a particularly desperate one. But the price? I have to serve him for an entire year, which means serving the people who sign contracts with him.</p>\n<p>So what's on the menu today? Will I get summoned by James, the high school student who's having bully issues? Or does Stella and her struggling rock band need me to set up all their equipment for a gig? Maybe the firefighter Brenda will send me into a <em>fire-filled fucking hellscape</em> to try to rescue someone!</p>\n<p>...It's not all bad, though. I'm learning how to do all sorts of crazy things, and as much as I hate the work, it feels good to help people. Plus, some of the people who summon me really aren't so bad, and I daresay there's a thing or two I can learn from them about what it really means to not only help someone, but to be a good friend.</p>\n<p>Over 61,000 words, 380 images, and 26 background songs, all made by one crazy motherfucker.\u00a0About 3 hours\u00a0are complete, representing roughly the first 15% of the story. Please enjoy.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Summoned contains quite a bit of explicit language.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b662f01c53dd8cf2d95b656b9d35e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Semicolonkid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
