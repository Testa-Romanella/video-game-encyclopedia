Where to begin? Might as well start with the worst of it: our home's gone. I think I'm still processing that. Every time I go to sleep, I keep thinking I'm going to wake up in my own bed. At least the nightmares have finally stopped.</p>\n<p>I've almost caught the one responsible for it, though I can't wrap my head around why he did it. With how much damage he's done across the world, I guess one small village didn't mean much to him. Funny. That village was my whole world. Well, whatever he's planning, I have to stop him; don't think I'll be able to find a new home if I don't.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm finally getting to see it all, just like you started to. Plenty of new friends, too. One of them said I should write this letter. You know, to help me... deal with it... I don't think it's working. Day in, day out, the one thing that keeps me going is the thought of what I'm going to do when I finally get him. And that thought scares me. I want to slaughter him, to slice him limb from limb and turn whatever's left to ash just like he did to</p>\n<p>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.\u00a0 I guess I'm doing okay, sis. Things are bad, but they'll get better soon. You'll always be in my heart.</p>\n<p>Love,<br/>Cyrus</p>\n</em>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Now that I (hopefully) have your attention, Jewels of the Shattered Moon is a story-driven role playing game with an emphasis on the characters. Though the narrative is the main draw, it is still a game, and you can expect the following features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A combat system based on exploiting enemy weaknesses (fire\u00a0beats\u00a0earth, magically\u00a0strong enemies\u00a0are\u00a0weak\u00a0to physical\u00a0attacks,\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0on)</li><li>Eight party members, each with their own special attacks, roles, and weaknesses rooted in the combat system</li><li>Puzzles and dungeons that make logical sense (fortresses, mansions, and temples rather than maze-like caves)</li><li>Bad place-holder art (hey, if you can't draw, might as well go for entertainingly bad, right?)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T07:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8adf505f160d78487c35b7e8193a405.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dusk_Army"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
