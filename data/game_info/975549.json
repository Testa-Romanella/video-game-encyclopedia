Developed in <strong>Game Maker Studio 2</strong> for the first time, the game incorporates nostalgic elements of the video game era.<br/><br/>The story follows J, a boy who, while playing soccer with his friends at the neighborhood field, accidentally kicks the ball into the sewer's manhole. His friends, annoyed with the loss of the ball, push J into taking responsibility and retrieve it. Upon entering the sewer, J discovers that the ball is not where he imagined, thus initiating his journey to find it. While exploring the sewer filled with creatures like Slimes, Flies, Toe-Biters, and Catfishes, he encounters several hardships.<br/><br/>Across 4 distinct stages inside the sewer, filled with enemies and bosses, J interacts with several NPCs who call the sewer home, some of whom give valuable tips to overcome the challenges.<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/>In the game, the player assumes control of <strong>J</strong>, making use of simple commands, like moving right and left, jumping, and attacking with the slingshot, which fires rocks. The challenge lies in exploring the area, fighting enemies and bosses while interacting with the residents of the sewer on the quest for the precious soccer ball.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T07:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/1318cfa2dbfaf944f93d5e3ca98c9ac8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KellenKyo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KellenKyo"], "esrb_rating": null}
