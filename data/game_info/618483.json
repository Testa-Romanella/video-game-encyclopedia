{"id": 618483, "slug": "adjacenttd", "name": "AdjacentTD", "name_original": "AdjacentTD", "description": "<p>AdjacentTD is a Tower Defense game without upgrades. Instead, your towers grow stronger by building modules surrounding the tower. Most of the modules interact with each other, getting even stronger. This leads to some ridiculously powerful towers.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to <strong>protect home module</strong> (light-green coloured flag).<br/></p>\n<p>Using the <strong>shop menu</strong> in <strong>bottom right corner</strong> of the screen, you can select one of 4 buildings and place it anywhere on the map (light blue squares are building plots). I recommend placing <strong>tower</strong> first. Every building costs <strong>money</strong>, keep that in mind.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>pause</strong> the game at any moment using <strong>pause button in top right sid</strong><strong>e</strong> of the screen. Building works during pause, if you need the extra time to think.</p><p>Description of buildings:</p><ul><li>Power module adds damage to the turret</li><li>Frequency module reduces time between each shot</li><li>Multiplier module increases all values of adjacent modules/turrets by 1.2x</li></ul><p>You can chain these effects, but remember:\u00a0<strong>power and frequency module boosts are additive, while multiplier module boost is multiplicative.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:52:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c89badc7e1a089b34b0a93418c298f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quivscor"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
