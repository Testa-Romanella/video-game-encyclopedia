Gameplay mechanics weren't implemented in time, so this prototype can merely act as a representation of art direction chosen for this game.<br/><br/><strong>-&gt; Intended behavior:</strong><br/>You are an insect with a very short lifespan (10-30 seconds). You can spend this time sitting around until you die, or try to achieve something. At the very least, you can make the road easier for your successors... by placing helpful corpses along their way.<br/><br/><strong>-&gt; Controls:</strong><br/>- WASD / Space. 'E' - die.<br/>- 'R' - restart the game. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:06:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/919/9191a50f22b367d8106b992c00d41a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Khud0"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
