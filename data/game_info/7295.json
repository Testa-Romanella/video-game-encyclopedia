In an infinite world of abundance, we create new things by drawing them, build new places, hang out and chat, collect, make music, party, script objects, go on adventures... and have fun together in ways none of us can predict.<br/><br/>\"WONDERFUL ... so fun to explore, build, interact, and create ART. Such a variety of things in this world to do\" -Joshua C.<br/><br/>\"Exploring the world is a blast\" -Massively<br/><br/>\"The most exciting game I've played so far mainly because of its freedom to shape your world.\" -Cosmin<br/><br/>\"i love this game!!\" -Carie Corman<br/><br/>Draw, build, make music, party, go swim, script interacting objects and adventures, do sports, come up with puzzles, play, explore... Manyland is an open universe with no predefined story, theme or goal... it becomes what we will make of it!<br/><br/>Every pixel you see in Manyland is created by all of us together as community.
