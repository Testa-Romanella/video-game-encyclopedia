{"id": 593580, "slug": "snake-dungeons", "name": "Snake Dungeons", "name_original": "Snake Dungeons", "description": "<p>Control the Snake divinity and save the Elements' dungeons by purging the corruption! This game takes back the old formula of the Snake game, modifying some rules, in a dungeon-action style inspired by old classics like The Legend of Link Zelda. The goal is to progress through randomly generated dungeons of different elements, get keys to advance, beat the miniboss, get the boss key and finally beat the boss, saving the guardian.<br/></p>\n<p>The game moves at a set timing. Like in the classic Snake game, you can turn on the sides or keep going forward but not go back. The Snake will keep moving and can only stop against walls. Unlike in the original though, you can hit walls or even eat your own tail to advance without penalty. Your life is represented by the hearts in the top left corner and can increase by collecting hearts or eating enemies. Avoid hazards and attacks to survive. Dangers are signaled by red panels on where the attacks will hit. The brighter, the closer to losing a life you are. On the top right is your stock of bombs that you can use in emergency to kill nearby foes.<br/></p>\n<p>This game features a double speed mode (called double tempo) to speed up your adventures. Also, a scoring for your completion time, final body length and number of eaten enemies, for each dungeon. A seeding option also exists. Finally a list of achievements is available, complete them to get medals for each achievement. The game is designed for keyboards and basic controlers, with a rebind possible for keyboards.</p>\n<p>ALSO FREE DEMO ! Includes the full Water Dungeon, with all features !
