Known as a maze-based transport puzzle game, the player has to move a number of boxes to designated positions on the map. Because of the limited movement possibilities and various obstacles this job requires logic to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p>The Sokoban DS version contains a total of 250 levels of varying difficulty and has full usage of DS 3D graphics, that allows free panning and zooming within levels. For begiiners the basic game mechanics are explained in an included tutorial. It also includes an undo/redo function, individual characters and replays.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-12T12:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a4c13ba04e2fcfa6116a8960db1546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Braingame Publishing"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["RTL Playtainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
