My first game project!</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: Gamemaker's HTML5 export seems to not want to work super correctly, but it still plays well! I'll work to resolve that, but if you want the nice, crispy clear sprites and to be sure everything works properly, download the game!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Defeat the enemy before you run out of time! Increase your match counter, and then use your powers with Space to win the fight!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>ASD - Select the wheels you would like to turn.<br/>Up/Down Arrows - Spin the wheel up/down<br/>Right/Left Arrows - Spin the rightmost row\u00a0<br/>Space - Use your powers! Your most recent matches are indicated in the center of the wheels. You'll use all the powers currently shown!</p>\n<p><strong>Gems:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Red Triangle - Do damage to the enemy<br/>Green Pentagon - Shield yourself from enemy attack<br/>Blue Star - Increase your remaining transformation time! You run out of this, you lose!<br/>White Burst - Neutral! Doesn't do anything except increase your matches.<br/>Black Circle - When you take damage, your wand will take damage, and a gem will break. These do not match with anything!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>ASSET CREDITS</strong>: (itch collection)<br/></p>\n<p>Villager sprites from craftpix.net<br/>Slime/minion sprites by Warren Clark<br/>Police sprites by EvgeniyLuch<br/>Circles/Gems edited from the Kenney Game Assets pack<br/>Backgrounds by momeG<br/>Transform/fanfare sfx by @BunnzoSteel<br/>Sound effects made with https://sfxr.me/<br/>Music by Abstraction</p>\n<p>Fonts used:<br/>In-game font: Franklin Gothic Demi<br/>Menu font: Silver by PoppyWorks <br/>Logo font: Hiatus by Khurasan <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:46:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09b/09b38a7ef32a002541dae5a232fa7d9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BoredBanshee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
