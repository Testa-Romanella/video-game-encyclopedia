{"id": 771342, "slug": "command-line-attack", "name": "Command Line Attack", "name_original": "Command Line Attack", "description": "<p>[Made in 4.5 hours for TriJam 165, Theme : One Action at a Time]</p>\n<p>There is a creature willing to collect coins for you and you can tell him what to do\u00a0<strong>one action at a time</strong> from your command station. Try to survive as long as you can while attacking enemies and collecting coins. How many points can you rack up?</p><p><strong>Beat My Score Challenge:</strong><br/></p><p>Coins Collected - 14</p><p>Enemies Killed - 10</p><p>Final Score - 1900</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>This is all based in a command prompt on the right-side of the game window. You can use the following commands to complete actions:</p>\n<p><strong>face [direction] </strong>- Turn to face a given [direction]. Options are up, down, left, and right.\u00a0(i.e. face up, face down, face left, face right)</p>\n<p><strong>move</strong> - Move in the direction you are currently facing</p>\n<p><strong>heal</strong> - Use your health kit to replenish your health.</p>\n<p><strong>attack</strong> - Attack an enemy in front of you<br/></p>\n<p><strong>take_dmg</strong> - This is a command where you can hurt yourself (testing purposes)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>kill</strong> - This will immediately kill your character (testing &amp; exit purposes)<br/></p>\n<p>To use a command, type it in and then press ENTER on your keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The scrollbar on the command prompt is obnoxious but couldn't figure it out. I would've wasted more hours working on fixing it. Most fail safes for command issues are there, but I may have missed one or two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Palette : 2-Bit Dichrome (Lospec.com)</p>\n<p>SFX made using SFXR</p>\n<p>All art made by Metaphysics Studio</p>\n<p>Menu Theme : \"Great Boss\" by Spring Spring\u00a0(OpenGameArt)</p>\n<p>Game Theme: \"8-Bit Battle Loop\" by Wolfgang (OpenGameArt)</p>\n<p>Font Used:\u00a0https://universs.itch.io/cursed-script-font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf25c5b49696d34bbdb5757f305934e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MetaphysicsStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
