The air is filled with the hum of drones and ships. Your home is dying!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You must act now! Be the natural disaster and wipe out the alien cities. Unleash the power of the elements and become the ultimate warrior god!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gods Against Machines is an action-packed roguelike RTS where every run is different thanks to a wide variety of spells and blessings, as well as procedurally generated maps. Here is what you will do in a typical mission of the campaign:<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Protect and build your base</strong> - Huge crystals rising from the ground are your source of mana. Protect them and (optionally) build your base around them with spells that summon different types of buildings - mini volcanoes that bombard enemies from afar, or spirit dwellings that spawn powerful sprites to fight for you.<br/></li><li> <strong>Cast Epic Spells</strong> - Use your offensive spells to rain down destruction on your enemies - literally! Fire Rain, Thunderstorm, Meteor Storm - all powerful destructive abilities that unleash your wrath upon the machines.<br/></li><li> <strong>Control Corruption</strong> - Prevent machines from spreading corruption - either by destroying their terraformers or by cleaning the corruption yourself using various spells or minions. Do not let it get out of control or you will lose!<br/></li><li> <strong>Destroy the machines</strong> - destroy enemy buildings to deplete their resources - when they run out, you win!<br/></li><li> <strong>Boss Battles</strong> - When all of the machines' resources are used up, one of their commanders will appear - prepare for an epic final battle!<br/></li><li> <strong>Reap as many rewards as you can</strong> - the less corruption your world has suffered, the more rewards you will receive! Acquire new spells, add new abilities to existing spells, and use powerful Blessings to improve your build and find game-changing synergies!</li></ul><br/>But that is not all! Not only do you have several gods to choose from, each with their own special spells and mechanics, but there is also Gaia, the Mother of Nature. She will help you throughout the campaign and has her own special powers - and you will be able to activate some of them in each run! In addition, the game's roguelite progression is based on Gaia's powers:<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Meta Progression</strong> - Each run allows you to upgrade the abilities of Gaia, who will help you throughout the campaign. The more you play, the more powerful Gaia becomes, and the easier it will be for you to progress! Go beyond the normal campaign into the Void Realm - the game's endless mode. How far can you go?<br/></li><li> <strong>Synergize your powers with Gaia</strong> - Pick the right Gaia powers to activate and get crazy synergies that are otherwise impossible. Experiment, upgrade, and replay the campaign to get the overpowered build you need to conquer even the Void Realm!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>In this free prologue, you can try out two of the four available gods: Azzinoth, the god of fire, and Nadea, the goddess of water. You will have the full arsenal of their spells at your disposal, as well as dozens of unique blessings and curses. Gaia, the Mother of Nature, will also come to your aid, though only 5 of her 11 powers will be available for you to try. Even with these limitations, the amount of different builds you can try is massive. Progress through the campaign to level 12 (out of 40 total) and rain down epic destruction on your enemies!<br/><br/>The full game includes even more spells, a full campaign with increasingly tougher enemies to take on, and a challenge mode to push your build to its limits!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T04:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f2bb28b429b66a7851f95d1d8438de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver Eye Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Silver Eye Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
