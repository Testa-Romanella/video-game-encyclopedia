A story of a King lost in an eerie world filled with monsters and other unholy beings. This first chapter begins with the king but you will eventually take control of Vanya Cross, a mercenary/rogue\u00a0tasked with finding him and safely bringing him back.</p>\n\n<p>This is the second game I've made. \u00a0I've taken what I learned from my first game and applied that knowledge to this game. The criticism was a big help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f230f8c492ebea4e819e2a7ba3fbb67b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pantomime Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
