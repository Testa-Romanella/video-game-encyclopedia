Sack mead has a high concentration of honey.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T10:38:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847245711d58f0637692504efa9de662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TaftPunk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
