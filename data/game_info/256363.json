Thats right, I am talking to you.  Get behind the controls of this World War 2 plane and shoot down some enemies.  Hurry up Pilot, the war needs soldiers like you!<br/><br/>\"Super fun and easy to play, highly addictive\"<br/>\"One of the Best and Easiest 3D combat flight sims I have ever seen\"<br/>\"I am a game developer, and I can't put this thing down!\"<br/><br/>Those are some of the comments we have had from users who have played this game.  Get behind the controls of this World War 2 aircraft.  You will find yourself at the forefront of the most heated air battles possible.  Shoot down as many aircraft as possible before you get shot down.  There is little room for error; one wrong move and you will be toast.  And don't think these planes are going to go down with a single shot.  You need to really nail them to take them out.  This flight simulator has it all.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>--Realistic combat flight simulator<br/>--Easy touch controls<br/>--Excellent 3D graphics<br/>--Exciting gameplay<br/>--Highly addictive - you will want to play again and again<br/>--Excellent sound effects<br/>--Realistic guns and explosions<br/>--Multiple camera views - cockpit or behind the plane<br/><br/>There are 2 modes of Gameplay:  Either full on Head-to-Head Dogfighting, or Warzone Survival.  In Head to Head, you will find yourself up against very skilled enemy planes.  These guys are not going to just sit there and let you shoot them down.  If you go after then, they will try and evade your fire.  In Warzone Surivial, you must evade the gunfire from the ground as well as the enemy aircraft.<br/><br/>Some Tips:  I prefer to stay low when I play.  Fly between the towers to have the best chance of hitting your target.  The most aircraft I was able to shoot down was 7.  Try and beat it.  Its not easy.  Good luck pilot!  Don't let us down!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/980/980638606f94f4c5fb7159c82683c4be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ksenia Tsarkova"], "genres": ["RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Ksenia Tsarkova"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
