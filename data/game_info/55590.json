Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon is a computer game for Amiga and Commodore 64 systems, developed by Traveling Bits Production.</p>\n<p>P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon is a platform game with puzzle elements. It is influenced by the earlier game Lode Runner. In the game, the player controls a character called P. P. Hammer, who is on a quest to discover and acquire all treasures from a series of more than 60 levels. These levels are divided into four graphical themes: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Medieval castles, and ice. A fifth theme, LegoLand, appears on bonus levels.</p>\n<p>Each level in the game is made up of rectangular blocks, and contains various things including treasures, enemies, locked doors, bonus items and traps. P. P. Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him to drill through a block he's standing next to. As in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him.</p>\n<p>P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level. After completing each level a level password is displayed, allowing the player to continue from that point at a later time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23675166b1248a69ea9eaebad515fa03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Traveling Bits"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Demonware"], "esrb_rating": null}
