Her sole wish is to always be with her friend Makina. But will she find love one day?<br/><br/>Having magical powers that far exceed even our sorcerer protagonist, she is a \u201cspirit-seer,\u201d someone who can see otherworldly beings. However, she has a hard time fitting in with normal society because of this ability. But after meeting our protagonist, she starts to become interested in magic.<br/><br/>A former resident of Fukano, she has returned and is searching for something she lost named \u201cOtsuki.\u201d<br/><br/><br/>A picture-perfect, high-born woman from a good family. Kind and gentle, she supports our protagonist who has zero ability to take care of himself. Doing everything for him from cooking to cleaning, she is always there for him because she believes he is the best sorcerer around.<br/><br/>One fateful day, she was saved by the protagonist and decided to support him as his secretary. And in doing so, she might have caught the disease most fatal to her\u2014love.<br/><br/><br/>Always wearing a maid outfit and cleaning restrooms has earned Hanako the moniker \u201cMaid Hanako.\u201d Her usual mode may be being unexpressive in both face and voice, but her actions are often wild and unpredictable.<br/><br/>She\u2019s actually a spirit called a \u201cshuihu.\u201d As well as being a water god\u2019s personal messenger, she is the master of the Nekogawa River, leader of a band of red kappa, and kind of a big deal. Thanks to all this, she\u2019s well informed about the goings-on of the area. And when it comes to gossip in the school, she\u2019s got all the facts. The deck brush she carries may be the most powerful weapon in the world.<br/><br/>How does her constant testing of the protagonist\u2019s mettle fit into her goals?<br/><br/><br/>A very playful, older sister type... who\u2019s really, really small. <br/>She\u2019s a dyed-in-the-wool country girl with an accent to match. However, she thinks she has no accent.<br/><br/>She can\u2019t see spirits and doesn\u2019t understand magic in the slightest. Still, since she\u2019s the protagonist\u2019s honorary older sister, she\u2019s always on his side. She\u2019s a soothing presence in his life.<br/><br/>Lovebird spirits seem to really like her for some reason.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T02:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7d2a94829c76a55e6b9aed12b66b68b.jpg", "website": "https://shiravune.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azurite"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
