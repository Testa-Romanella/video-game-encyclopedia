{"id": 886363, "slug": "cube-rush-kiwicave", "name": "Cube Rush (KiwiCave)", "name_original": "Cube Rush (KiwiCave)", "description": "<p>Cube  Rush is a simple puzzle game featuring Green and Purple cubes that move  along, going about their day. They need to get to their respective  portals, and only you can guide them there. However, they react to the  same directions differently, and you have to create two separate paths,  one for each of them to get them home!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are simple, click on a button on the right side of the  screen to select that Item, then you can place it upon one of the Pads  in the main area by clicking on it. When a Cube moves over this pad,  they will change directions. There's also a Portal Pad, setting up two  of these will link them together, and if a cube touches one, they will  teleport to the other. Each cube can only teleport once, however. And  keep and eye out for Danger Pads, as any cube that touches one will  cease to exist.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Made for the 2022 Koia Game Jam, check out the other games at\u00a0https://koia.nz/games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/44162c913c53e6e8453fc5939d10eeea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KiwiCave"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
