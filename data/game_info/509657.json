In this case my project uses ImGui, SFML and irrKlang.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading and for (hopefully) playing my game. I really, really enjoyed making this project and I hope that you can find some enjoyment in a project that I spent around 12 weeks of my life on! Thank you again and I hope you have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>- Benjamin Gulliver aka fatherbeno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/70233f0305b50d01b195331176e1336e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fatherbeno"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
