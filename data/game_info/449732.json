This was made just for the GameDev.tv Community Jam. Alternate Time was built from scratch in 20 days.</p>\n<p>It's been really interesting learning everything from a Udemy course and putting it into practice. I stumbled across the GameDev.tv community jam on the 9th of May, after which I knew I wanted to get a final product entered into this game jam.</p>\n<p>I made this game to show myself that I can learn a brand new skill in about 20 days. And 20 days later, I have a short but sweet game ready here. I love this community and developing with you guys, and I hope that another GameDev.tv community jam will happen soon, as this was loads of fun!</p>\n<p>If you have any bugs or issues,\u00a0 look in the discussions for a bug thread, and post your issues / bugs in there. I'll try and fix any and all bugs that you report!</p>\n\r\nSpeedrun Mode\r\n<p>Finished the main game? Alternate Time also includes a Speedrun mode, in which you will have a timer and no dialog. Try and finish the game as fast as possible and submit your scores to the leaderboard!</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Textures:\u00a0kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Soundtrack:\u00a0Gravity Sound - Mysterious</p>\n<p>Main menu music:\u00a0Pehrs puzzle</p>\n<p>QA and Playtesting:\u00a0Zwinn, w0zak\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\r\nSource:\r\n<p>Below you can find the source code for the game.
