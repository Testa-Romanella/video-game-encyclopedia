{"id": 841888, "slug": "starfish-yeet", "name": "Starfish Yeet", "name_original": "Starfish Yeet", "description": "<p>Starfish YEET is a simple arcade-style game where you YEET a purple starfish to collect points and avoid dangerous sea creatures.</p>\n<p>This is my very first completed video game project, created using GML coding language in GameMaker Studio 2. I created this game simply as an exercise. Rather than focusing on large, lofty goals, I\u00a0set out to make a simple game that could be completed in a short amount of time. This project took around 2 weeks to complete, and I'm rather happy with the results.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0view the game more as a \"sketch\" than anything - something to work on for fun, to complete, then move on to a new simple project. Eventually I\u00a0will aim to make something bigger with potential for monetization, but that goal is far off from the present.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T13:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/306de8bd9ba2bcf05b7e2caac81f1063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gogort"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
