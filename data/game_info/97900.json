{"id": 97900, "slug": "regions", "name": "Regions", "name_original": "Regions", "description": "<p>Regions is an abstract, minimal puzzle game about drawing paths and understanding geometry. The 6 x 6 playing field is divided into different regions and your task is to draw a path that covers only one square of each. Later levels introduce regions that have different mechanics to keep things interesting across 160 levels. Regions also features a dynamic soundtrack that responds to how you play.</p><p>Also included is a level editor that unlocks after the entirety of the game is completed (or when a secret code is entered). It isn't a fully polished product, but it's in the game for those who want to mess around with the same tools that were used to make the game.</p><p>A color blind option is also available.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/4600f4000c06d5a83d8c2bfee44d994f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ian Spadin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
