The user plays the role of the Master, a dethroned deity \n      whose once idyllic world has fallen under the control of the Evil One. \n      Stripped of godly power, the Master must somehow put an end to the Evil \n      One\u2019s reign and rebuild his desolate realm.\n    </p><p>\n      Game play alternates between two modes: Action and Simulation. In Action \n      mode, the Master must battle against impossible odds to pacify six \n      lands. Pacifying a land unlocks Simulation mode. In this mode, the \n      Master must oversee the development and repopulation of the territory he \n      has reclaimed. In doing so, he will gain followers who gradually restore \n      his godly might, empowering him to take back the next land and, \n      ultimately, defeat the Evil One.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
