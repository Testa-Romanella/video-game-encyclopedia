The experiment succeeded. Those the first human test was completed on gained powers beyond their wildest imaginations.<br/><br/>Increased mental capacity. Telekinesis. Telepathy. Super strength.<br/><br/>But no success story can happen without it\u2019s downfalls, and an unforeseen side effect occurred. They began to lose their humanity. It only happened in short bursts, but when it did, together with their new found powers, they became extremely dangerous. And so they were euthanized, their lives ended as humanely as possible, and the experiment was marked a failure. The risks were too great to continue any further.<br/><br/>But one man - the lead scientist of the project - escaped. Desperate for his life\u2019s work not to go unnoticed he created one last version of the drug, in an attempt to remove the side effects. Seemingly, it worked. However, with the results of the last experiment clear, this scientist too was considered a danger. He fled into hiding with his family.<br/><br/>The man was never found, and with complete silence from him perhaps proving him to have kept his sanity, eventually the search was called off. The failed experiment was called to a close and buried.<br/><br/>Years later, mysterious accident after accident has led to the death of both the scientist and all members of his family. Only one remains; his great granddaughter, protected since birth by a small group among the last of those that still know about the experiment, and from whom the secret of her past has been kept for years. But she\u2019s about to find out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/89141f824e16bd0fd3b8d022dfeee665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["heartfragment", "HF Gaming"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HF Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
