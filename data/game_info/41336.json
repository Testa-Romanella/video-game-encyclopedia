{"id": 41336, "slug": "wasteland-2", "name": "Wasteland 2", "name_original": "Wasteland 2", "description": "<p>Wasteland 2 is a turn-based RPG, set in a postapocalyptic world. The game is the direct sequel to the original release of 1988, and it follows in the predecessor\u2019s footsteps, trying to preserve the feel of an old-school RPG.<br />\nThe story of the game is in the year 2102, 15 years after the first game and more than a hundred - after the nuclear war. The player will create a platoon of four recruits to the Desert Rangers, and guide them on different quests through the Wasteland. The game\u2019s roleplay mechanics will ensure that every action that you take will have an impact on the story, which makes every playthrough enjoyable and new. <br />\nThe game\u2019s difficulty will often set obstacles for new players, as the sequel is as unforgiving as the original. After three, ten, hundred attempts, the players will realize the need to be always ready for new challenges, and in that, Wasteland 2 shines the most, providing great tests but offering great fruit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T19:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8c8/8c8e92ef385fb2394a96cee14061c901.jpg", "website": "http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 485, "beaten": 46, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 35, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 76, "suggestions_count": 571, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 77, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Obsidian Entertainment", "InXile Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": null}
