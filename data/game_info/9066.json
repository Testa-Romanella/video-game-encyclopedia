Clementine is an original character from the previous episodes.<br />\nShe is still alive and trying to survive. She meets Javier Garcia. Javier\u2019s family was taken from him, so he has to find them. Together they find out about the existence of the New Frontier. It is a group of survivors, whose credibility is ambiguous. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like two past seasons, the third one is a point-and-click adventure. However, in turn, there are two available characters.<br />\nYou can play as a Javier, who was introduced only in this episode. The player can choose Clementine, but only in flashbacks. You control and direct your character around the environment, explore different scenery elements and pick up and keep objects. These objects can be used to advance the story later.<br />\nMoreover, you can begin dialogues with non-player characters. Their answers can give a broad range of choices; it even includes staying silent. The time for making a selection is limited. However, even if the player does not make it, the conversation is not stopping. In this case, it is regarded as you stayed silent. These choices have an impact on later events. There are more action-oriented scenes, where you have to make quick decisions. If you fail it, you would have to restart from the very beginning of the scene.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2016-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T07:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f0a/f0a65d7d9c4534f8f4897f9d161307ed.jpg", "website": "https://telltale.com/series/the-walking-dead-a-new-frontier/", "rating": 3.61, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 124, "owned": 1305, "beaten": 641, "toplay": 88, "dropped": 42, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 154, "ratings_count": 596, "suggestions_count": 609, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 602, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "Android"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games", "Skybound Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
