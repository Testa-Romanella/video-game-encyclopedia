However,\u00a0when you pass directly next to\u00a0a block, it attaches itself\u00a0to you and\u00a0results in it moving along with you. You must then use this mechanic of blocks attaching to you to\u00a0navigate through\u00a0various levels, with the goal of creating\u00a0 specific polyominoes (shapes made up of\u00a0multiple equally sized squares) at the end of the level.</p>\n\n<p>But attachable blocks are not the only thing you'll come into contact with throughout the level</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/784/784718c524c3e9ddde181d990868cb76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MikeFParkin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
