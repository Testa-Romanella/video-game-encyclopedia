(Less platforming, more avoiding enemies/fighting) Might add a cutscene, probably not. Level Two, where you escape the ship in a pod. (almost only platforming, but has harder obstacles, like broken airlocks, or the sort)\u00a0Might add a final cutscene here too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other changes may be added, such as enemy variants, or something of the sort, but most likely not.<br/><br/>Game Story:\u00a0You are a rebel working for the Ottos. a rebellious group against the current biggest Galactic Superpower:\u00a0The Iron Coalition. The Ottos send you, and their most impressive tech yet, the Anti-Gravity Suit, on one simple mission: Destroy Origin Station, the space station that allows all transport from the Iron Coalition's inner colonies to the outer colonies. It won't be easy. Can you accomplish this mission and cripple the Iron Coalition?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/86297e59f5a9d9c63811d9003e28f4e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SaltyLily"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
