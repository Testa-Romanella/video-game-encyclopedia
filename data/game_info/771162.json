It is a <strong>mini casual game</strong> to relax to, but also excel at, by trying to achieve the highest score.<br/><br/>Each level represents a flag, while the cars hold a minimalistic style. The sounds follow the same pattern by being abstract in their manner.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong>:<br/><br/>\u2022 <strong>Mechanics</strong>: As simple as possible, the players just have to press on the traffic lights to change from red to green and vice versa.<br/><br/>\u2022 <strong>Relaxing</strong>: The game is as stressful as you want it to be, with the time also available on fast and slow. Fast however provides you with double score.<br/><br/>\u2022 <strong>Competitive</strong>: For the hard working people out there, there is a scoring system for each level, at which everyone can excel at.<br/><br/>\u2022 <strong>Interesting decisions</strong>: Every level provides a different traffic management, making the players adapt to every situation.<br/><br/>\u2022 <strong>Abilites</strong>: Every in-game day the players get an ability to help with their progression.<br/><br/>Hope you get as many cars as you can across traffic! See you on the leaderboard!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b9ac5eb990918a0db0c2553d7d8ea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GeorgeKle"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
