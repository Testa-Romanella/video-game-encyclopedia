There are 12 mech models, and each of them has its own unique characteristics: while the first ones are faster, the second are stealthier, and the third are stronger. Additionally, every mech has a special ability. You can choose the robot that fits your playstyle - or try them all one by one. \u00a0<br />\n Mechs can be upgraded with experience points, gained during battles, or with modules and gadgets, you can buy in stores. While the experience develops passive initials characteristics, gadgets work as boosts and additional abilities. \u00a0<br />\nMaps in these game deserve special attention as they are not flat and linear - instead, each of them has several levels to demonstrate mechs\u2019 ability to jump and fly. Map design is another challenge for you along with the development as it needs you to be careful and quickly respond to your opponents\u2019 moves and attacks.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2014-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9da/9da42a4da370cc386c8578f0b2578e2c.jpg", "website": "http://www.playhawken.com/", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 79, "owned": 2607, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 202, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 296, "suggestions_count": 706, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 296, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["505 Games", "Reloaded Games", "Hawken Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["505 Games", "Reloaded Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
