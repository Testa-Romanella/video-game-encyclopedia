You will need to collect 5 things in order to have this breakfast.</p>\n<p>Try to collect all the needs for eating a fired egg!!! Avoid touching\u00a0 fires and ... sugar ewww. It\u00a0will ruin the taste of\u00a0your fried egg.</p>\n<p>In this game,\u00a0 I desgined a score counter,\u00a0 different sound effects, and buttons. I used tile maps and animation. The only problem I met now is that I couldn't make the last scene re-enter into the start by button click.</p>\n<p>I would also continue work on to convert my kitchen game into a larger series. Check the link below to see more about this game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://cclab-portolio-zhijun.glitch.me/p7.html.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c198150c7bdabc7de7e0816b22e3fba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["zsong2020"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
