The night may not go as planned.</p>\n\n<p>(for years I've started projects and never finished them, so finally I've forced myself to finish one. Personally, I'm upset to see what seems like my interest in finishing the project wane.. but at least I've finally finished one and actually put it out there. It's short, sweet and simple. Please enjoy.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/8889ae4c6e0159bc8ad5e47e9d0387eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IshChris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
