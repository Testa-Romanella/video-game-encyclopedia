It is a critique of classical imperial narratives and an attempt to establish a new communist game paradigm, using real scientific principles.</p>\n<p><strong>Video games are merely capitalist distractions</strong>, designed to isolate workers and divert their attention from the work of building a more equal society for one another!</p>\n<p>Laika, proletariat canine, has been given command of the People's Space Vessel, Sputnik II and must pilot it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This game is hard</strong>, because it is meant to awaken you to the manipulation of your socio-economic paradigm by capitalist employers. <strong>This game is frustrating</strong> because we want you to smash your keyboard and seize the means of production.<strong> This game is impossible</strong> because we want you to destroy your monitor the way we want you to destroy the kleptocracy of billionaires who use you the way farmers use pigs and cattle.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Space- Thruster</p>\n<p>A/D- Rotate</p>\n\r\nGOAL\r\n<p>You must land your space shuttle on the landing pad.
