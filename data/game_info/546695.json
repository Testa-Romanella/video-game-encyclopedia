Each player owns six cups or holes and one reservoir, a large cup also named mancala zone. At the beginning of the game, the player finds four stones (or pieces) in every cup.<br/><br/>Players put stones repeatedly in a counterclockwise direction. To begin, the player takes the stones from any cup on his side of the game board - leaving empty this cup that he has already taken the stones. The player put pieces through all twelve cups and his mancala zone (which is on the right of the gameboard) but not the opponent's reservoir (on the left of the gameboard).<br/><br/>*Go-again play*<br/>If the last stone lands in your reservoir, the turn is yours and you can take another move.<br/><br/>*Cross-capture*<br/>If the last stone lands in an empty cup on your side of the board and there is one or more stones in the adjacent hole on your opponent's side of the mancala board, you capture these opponent's stones and yours last one.<br/><br/>*End of the game*<br/>The game ends if all six cups on the side of each player are empty. The one who has more pieces captured in his mancala zone wins.<br/><br/>*Different names of Mancala games*<br/>Games from the same group have various rules and names.
