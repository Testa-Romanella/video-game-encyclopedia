As a warning to the player, there are two known bugs and one incomplete feature:<br/></p>\n<p>1. The game may freeze during the AI's turns. In order to get around that, click on the box with the word \"week\", and press the arrow that appears below.</p>\n<p>2. The \"Redraw Boundaries\" feature may not always work, or the error messages may not appear. If this occurs, you will have to select another tile to shift instead.</p>\n<p>3. The credits scene is empty. This will be filled soon.</p>\r\nNotes on the Mac and Windows versions:\r\n<p>1.
