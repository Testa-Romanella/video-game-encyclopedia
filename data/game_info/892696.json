A weapon system with a selection of 3 weapon types<br/><strong>-Challenges. </strong>The boss you will face has 3 challenges. Can you beat them all?<br/><strong>-Fully hand-drawn art. </strong>Every single frame in the game is hand-drawn to give a similar feeling to the likes of our source material. There's over <strong>1000 </strong>hand drawn frames in the game right now, and over <strong>2000</strong> if we count unused/scrapped frames.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>-Collectibles. </strong>Each boss will have collectibles in forms of coins you can gather and put in a journal. Once 3 coins of that boss-type has been put in the journal, you unlock an \"uber\" version of that boss that awards you with weapon upgrades that might come in handy for future bosses.<br/><strong>-Quests. </strong>The player can encounter friendly npcs in the overworld that has tasks for the player. Complete these tasks to unlock new parts of the world or alternate travel routes.<br/><strong>-Mini bosses. </strong>Single-phase fights that grants you minor upgrades upon completion<br/><strong>-More major bosses. </strong>The currently available boss took slightly more than a month to finish, mostly because of how art heavy a multi-phased fight can be. If there is an interest from the public, we might consider doing more sooner than later.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f3/2f378130a5a1d56dc25baed23de7ce5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calle1122", "Karba"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
