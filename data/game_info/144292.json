The theme was \"the more you have, the worse it is.\"</p>\n<p>You control a drone on different planets' surface whose mission is to find and mine all the sanguinite in an area. There are also salvageable upgrades laying around that can power up your drones. Be careful though; the more you take from the planet's surface, the more hostile the native life becomes (this is especially true for sanguinite).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4fdc009eabf06572c399641d5a211f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wheffle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
