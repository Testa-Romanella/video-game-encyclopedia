Play this amazing, absolutely enthralling, pretty much perfect visual novel that portrays the intricacies and movements of the Bill Clinton 1998 Scandal. In this game, you play as Monica Lewinsky, on a search to seduce Bill Clinton and have an affair with him. Can you do it? Can you find Bill Clinton? Can you find your Clozaril and banish George Bush?\u00a0Can you have an affair with Bill Clinton? \u00a0Can you?\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't know, maybe. It's not exactly that hard (or maybe it is.)</p>\n\n<p>(I would suggest a slow text speed and full screen mode, for the feels. I also have taken extreme liberties in my re-telling of this '90s tale, but, trust me, it's good.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fe/0fe426eb3dfae0854e01d087a728d3ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Comerade Napoleon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
