{"id": 377275, "slug": "indiecalypse-itch", "name": "Indiecalypse (itch)", "name_original": "Indiecalypse (itch)", "description": "<p>Three stories, three outcasts, three nerds\u2026 and a single destiny:\u00a0<em>to make the best video game ever</em>.</p>\n<p>Indiecalypse depicts the crude reality of indie game developers and their struggles to get their shit together when it comes to releasing a video game.</p>\n\n<p>Three misfits team up to design and produce their own indie game, finding themselves in a path of\u00a0<strong>chaos</strong>,\u00a0<strong>self-destruction</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>resentment</strong>. But there\u2019s also space for\u00a0<strong>crude humor</strong>,\u00a0<strong>pop culture</strong>\u00a0references, gratuitous and non-gratuitous\u00a0<strong>violence</strong>... and\u00a0<strong>fear</strong>. Fear of the dozens of lawsuits for copyright infringement, obscenity and profanity we\u2019ll have to face if the game is finally published.</p>\n\n<p>In Indiecalypse we'll play as Jack Jackson (programming), Ethan Wornick (music) and Violet Oakly (art), and live their own particular stories.\u00a0<em><strong>The game's main mechanic is based on modern exploration/adventure games, but Indiecalypse also includes more than 20 mini-games</strong></em>, most of them copied, sorry, based (let's say inspired by...) some of the most popular games and mechanics in video game history.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Jack Jackson</strong></em>\u00a0is\u00a0<em><strong>the programmer</strong></em>, responsible for bringing \u201c<strong>THE GAME</strong>\u201d to life, and he\u2019s the one who triggers the whole story. An ill-tempered, pretentious douchebag, his hygienic habits are at least questionable, and yet he\u2019ll surely manage to win your hearts.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s our main character and the team leader.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ethan Wortnick</strong>\u00a0is the game\u2019s\u00a0<strong>musician</strong>, a talented composer and\u00a0<strong>keytar\u00a0</strong>master. The word \u201ckeytar\u201d, by the way, is a blend of the words \u201ckeyboard\u201d and \u201cguitar\u201d, in case you didn\u2019t notice. Ethan is a cynical, easy-going fellow with a dubious lifestyle.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s Jack\u2019s first ally and eventually becomes the voice of his conscience, or something like that...</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, there\u2019s\u00a0<strong>Violet Oakly</strong>, the team\u2019s lead\u00a0<strong>artist</strong>. A former fine art\u2019s A-grade student, a series of unfortunate events molded Violet\u2019s personality into the hysterical leery concept artist she is now.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s the last member to join the team, and becomes Jack\u2019s second right hand. Because it\u2019s always useful to have two right hands.</p>\n\n\n<p>Indiecalypse is filled with references to some of the most popular -and not so popular- video games in history. The many mini-games scattered throughout the main game are our particular tribute to those titles that somehow have defined our miserable lives. In its essence, Indiecalypse is a heartfelt confession, an invitation to recall our sentimental memoirs as gamers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Graphic artist\u00a0<strong>H\u00e9ctor Toro\u00a0</strong>(@Narehop) is responsible for the game\u2019s visual style. He has collaborated with brands such as\u00a0<strong>Sony Playstation, Nintendo, Riot Games\u00a0</strong>or<strong>\u00a0Movistar\u00a0</strong>among many others. The style depicted in Indiecalypse reflects his own vision of the animation that can be seen on television nowadays. This style, known as \u201c<strong>Calarts</strong>\u201d is often used by\u00a0<em>Disney\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Cartoon Network</em>\u00a0to appeal to\u00a0<em>family friendly\u00a0</em>audiences. In the game, he wanted to create this striking contrast between cartoon animated drawing style and adult themes, gore, grotesque situations and black humor.</p>\n\n\n<p>References are a very common tool in audiovisual work. In Indiecalypse,\u00a0<strong>Pau Dami\u00e0 Riera</strong>\u00a0(</p>\n<p>@paudamiariera\u00a0<br/>), composer and sound designer with broad experience in animation, advertising and -of course- video games, has used well-known references as creative inspiration, paying tribute to all-time great film and video game scores. An exercise in style that comprises music and sound effects belonging to every possible genre, according to the eclectic and satirical narrative of the game.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game will be released in English, Spanish, German &amp; French.</p>\n<p>If you want\u00a0<em>Indiecalypse\u00a0</em>in another language, leave us a comment and we'll see if we can make it possible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you want to collaborate to translate the game to your language, don\u2019t waste a minute!\u00a0</strong></em>Contact us<em><strong>\u00a0as soon as possible.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Indiecalypse will be real and shall live forever on your dusty shelves or in your wettest dreams.</p>\n<p>But what if we manage to exceed this budget?
