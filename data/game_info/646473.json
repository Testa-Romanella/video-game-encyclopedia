Made in 48 hours for </strong>Discord Jam 6<strong> by myself (programming/music/sfx) and cats#7175 (art).</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\n<p><strong>You are the blue polar bear. Use A and D (or Left and Right arrows) to move.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Press W (or Up arrow) to shoot up, and S (or Down arrow) to shoot downward.</strong><br/></p>\n<strong>\n<p>On the left of the map, you will see a small town with a few houses and some tiny snowmen. They must be protected! If all of them die, you lose.</p>\n<p>All sorts of enemies will walk onto the screen from the top right and bottom right. Anything that isn't a snowman is an enemy and must be killed (if enemies get to your town of tiny snowmen on the left, they will shoot and kill the snowmen - so make sure you keep enemies away). Alongside the enemies spawning from the right, there will be snowmen - don't shoot them, as this will also kill the snowmen in your town.</p>\n<p>When you kill enemies, you get money! You can use money to purchase turrets (Press T then click on the screen to buy and place one).</p>\n<p>You win once you kill 128 enemies.<strong>\n</strong><br/></p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cfc0525d6d0430c2ba366596fc5984f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jordanb84"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
