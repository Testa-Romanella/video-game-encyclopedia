I'm well aware that the controls are not that great, yet it's fully playable if you can figure out how to cleverly dodge the enemies (hint: they're clever, but not complicated).</p><p>This is controlled with the two mouse buttons (and if you want to shut off the music, hit M). That's it; qualified for the Two Button Controls theme. How does it fit into growth? *shrug* You grow in power and your wallet grows if you play well? That's as close as I can get.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4eb75e282026c4290d09884f2b3cfd71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moon Moon Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
