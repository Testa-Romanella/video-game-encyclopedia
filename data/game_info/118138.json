The physics and trigonometry of getting the ball to move really did my head in. Huge thanks to Dave Crewe for detailed high school maths explanations, and everyone else who helped on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Move the two sides of the bar to make the ball roll back and forward. Collect all the coins while avoiding the spikes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The movement is the same as\u00a0<em>Tumbleseed</em>. I actually took it from\u00a0<em>Ice Cold Beer</em>. Actually I've never played\u00a0<em>Ice Cold Beer</em> but a friend posted an Instagram story of himself playing it just when I needed game ideas and that's where this started.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've made like 15 or so levels. There's also an endless mode where you can just see how many coins you can collect before you die.</p>\n<p>You can play this by yourself on a keyboard or use two controllers and try to play with a friend, each of you controlling one end of the bar. I\u00a0think that would be real good.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Keyboard</em>:<br/></p>\n<p>Left side of bar up/down: e/d</p>\n<p>Right side of bar: up/down arrow</p>\n<p>Menu buttons: z/x</p>\n<p><em>Controller</em>:<br/></p>\n<p>Left side of bar: up/down on player 2 d-pad</p>\n<p>Right side of bar: up/down on player 1 d-pad</p>\n<p>X and O in menus, I think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04faaefb604a49151ad418b03b871937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
