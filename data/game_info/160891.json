But the truth is that i wasn\u2019t able to balance the game in time.</p>\n<p>=============</p>\n<p>CONTROL</p>\n<p>zqsd /wasd : move the camera.</p>\n<p>scroll up/down : zoom in/out.</p>\n<p>right click on a building : display the interaction.</p>\n<p>right click on everything else : your soldiers meet up to become one powerful soldier.</p>\n<p>left click : your soldiers go to the point.</p>\n<p>=============</p>\n<p>I did my best this time but i still can\u2019t find the time to do the music and the sound design haha. This first ludum was fun, next time i hope to be able to finish a game completly (so with the music, sound, balance and bugless -couldn\u2019t fix all, sorry-).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/968/96829a047ca5b26b1e2f588a92bc6e5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kotra97"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
