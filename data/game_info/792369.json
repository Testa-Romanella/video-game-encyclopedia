With the candy you can buy upgrades for click power and candy per second. Your goal is to get as many candies as you can or beat the world record.</p>\n<p>____________________________________\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Note: I won't add load/save because it's to easy to hack and cheat. I'm sorry but I just don't know how to make it so you can't hack the load/save function. And BTW turbo mode doesn't make you get more money.</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Kevin Macleod</p>\n<p>Art: m u s h y</p>\n<p>Coding: me</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>#Bigproject #Tycoon #MobileFriendly #Mobile #Money #Games #Game #Coltroc #Candy #clickergame #Clicker<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T12:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759e9df71529fccea044555511c8ceba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KLOVATER"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
