You can pause with escape, skip dialogues with Enter. I had a good time building this, but it was my first game so you know don't expect miracles,\u00a0there are four levels and a fun bonus scene at the end.</p>\n<p>If you liked or didn't like it or want some source code or are just interested in how something worked\u00a0feel free to drop a comment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d11f44f3b600f57b9ac5d67c55b70fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cdcox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
