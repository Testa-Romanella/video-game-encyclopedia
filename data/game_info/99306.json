What makes it unusual is that you can add and remove elements such as animation, sound, etc. at any point in the game. All the things that affect how the game \r\n\t<em>feels</em> to play without altering any of the game's actual rules.   <br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHarpoon! was commissioned by the \r\n\tEdinburgh International Science Festival for their Play On exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland in 2017. You can see more info about the exhibits I built here.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb7a6612923d95ffc3ad7bac3a23a500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Niall Moody"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
