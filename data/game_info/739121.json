On a rare occasion in Level 2, a box will count as more than 1 box. (As in, rather than your score increasing by 1, it will increase by 2 or 3). <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/80371623a0c2f73faa6ad92b8ae0fbdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NolanAlighieri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
