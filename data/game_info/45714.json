{"id": 45714, "slug": "wrongworld", "name": "Wrongworld", "name_original": "Wrongworld", "description": "Wrongworld is a silly yet unforgiving survival game set on a low poly world filled with freakish inhabitants.<br/><br/>You play as a furry little space critter with a bit of a knack for whomping mutants. Crash-landed on a strange and surreal planet, you must decide whether to attempt to rebuild your ship and head home or try to make a new life for yourself. Either way, you'll be exploring, gathering, crafting, discovering, whomping and juggling a powerful need to eat.<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>UNFORGIVING SURVIVAL</strong> - You're gonna have to figure out the world for yourself and hopefully not die in the process. But you will. Probably a lot. And with perma-death and auto-saving, there's no sneaky reloading to avoid an untimely demise. Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try to learn from your fatal experiences. Super-Secret Bonus Hint #1: Food is good. Eat it.<br/></li><li> <strong>SILLINESS APLENTY</strong> - It might be a brutal world, but you may as well chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all as you go. Obliterate trees with your forehead, fast travel as a non-human cannonball, and become best friends with a cardboard box.<br/></li><li> <strong>RANDOMLY GENERATED</strong> - The world is completely randomised with every new game. And with a bunch of random events to discover/be subjected to, you're likely to face different hurdles every time you play.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T23:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/36872b4f5b66705283b6be1fc3e962ee.jpg", "website": "http://www.wrongworld.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 84, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sludj Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sludj Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
