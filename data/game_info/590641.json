{"id": 590641, "slug": "montauk", "name": "Montauk", "name_original": "Montauk", "description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In 2004 screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote the film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind which follows the main character undergoing a medical procedure to delete specific traumatic memories. This is done through the vehicle of sequentially reliving them in a dream. This exploration of the reliving, examination and possible deletion of memories through a dream state was the primary inspiration of this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of focusing on the deletion of memories however I was interested more in the distortion that occurs when \"misremembering\" them. Over time, memories tend to become warped and their true nature is forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Controls</em></p>\n<ul><li>- Use WASD and the mouse to move through the dream and memories.</li><li>- Left click or move into orange objects to interact</li></ul>\n<p><em>Gameplay</em></p>\n<ul><li>- Explore the memories through the doors in the dream</li><li>- Interact with orange items to reveal the true nature of the sounds</li><li>- Return to the dream after completing each section.
