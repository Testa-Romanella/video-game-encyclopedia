When the player's \"health\" is depleted, it automatically drops down a level, and reaching the \"score\" goal results in advancing a level. The game doesn't have a definitive end and can continue endlessly, but the difficulty increases over time.<br/><br/>The game is played by using keyboard keys to hit objects on the screen, earning points. When the score reaches a certain value, the player will level up to the next stage. Higher levels mean faster speed and more objects. As the levels increase, various different power-ups and items will appear. The game continues indefinitely, with unlimited levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T12:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d923891fe2fddfcf0367e2ec8a9eae90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QZQ Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QZQ Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
