Shift the reality\u00a0state of objects in various clever ways\u00a0to overcome the challenges of the world in\u00a0this puzzle platformer.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for 2022\u00a0Brackeys Game Jam, but due to technical issues of building with Unity on\u00a0Apple Silicon's Mac, it was not successfully submitted in time. Therefore I've decided to polish it further into a minimum viable product and publish it. This is the first MVP (and completed game project)\u00a0in my game development journey, so any feedbacks, suggestions or advices and very much welcomed. With that said, I hope that you will enjoy the game as much as I enjoy making it.</p>\n\n<p>The recommended\u00a0aspect ratio of display\u00a0for best experience is 16:9 (for example: display resolution of 1920x1080)\u00a0as there might be\u00a0some issues on in-game objects placement if display with\u00a0different aspect ratio is used. I am currently working on aspect ratio enforcing feature and will release a new version of the game\u00a0once it is done.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T14:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a3eaaa2adb203ecfcf74ae9b0199ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["rkrevolution"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
