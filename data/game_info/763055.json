Navigating through a storm of suspended cubes which slow movement on contact, players are armed with the ability to clear tunnels in the cubes, and place light throughout the arena.\u00a0<br/><br/>Faintly in the distance players hear the song of the eye who longs for a return to its socket... but only while the player faces\u00a0the correct direction.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It is the players job to bring the eye and socket together, and put The Wicker at ease. But beware, the spirit lurks nearer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T20:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/627/62721cbbac9b07e36e13dac0d62db69e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan Takami"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
