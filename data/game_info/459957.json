A kidnapped princess from a distant kingdom breaks free of her prison and runs off, away from the bandits that abducted her. From there, she encounters people and situations that not only provide her with friendship, but also bring her closer to home. Press ESC to quit the game. For the second minigame - where you must fight off bandits - By default, you're in the shielded position; guard against the arrows, but NOT the bandits. Press the Q key to attack with your sword. Be careful - attack bandits and NOT the arrows. Use the arrow keys to change the direction you're facing. Obtain at least 100 points before the timer runs out to win!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Artists: Arielle Jasmine Michelle Irada, Stephanie Pocci</p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0Michael Kirk, Avineesh Kompella, and Michael Perez</p>\n<p>Lead Designer: Avineesh Kompella</p>\n<p>Writer: Stephanie Pocci</p>\n<p>Sound Engineer: Nicholas Rogers</p>\n\n<p>For more information, check out our Global\u00a0Game Jam page:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/victoria</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea4d35868185d67122c3d5d73156f70a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avineesh \"Avi\" Kompella"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
