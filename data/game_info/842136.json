Or at least try to maintain cleanliness for as long as you can. As a toilet bowl, you need to catch the poops he deploy. But be careful, the bowl can clog after collecting too many and will be unable to catch more poop. You need to flush the toilet bowl to free yourself from bowlshit... yeah... and you will need enough\u00a0water to flush.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?<br/></strong>Your role is a toilet bowl and you have to prevent poops from falling on the floor.<br/>As you catch poops, the shit meter from left side of the screen fills up. When you are full of shit, you cannot take anymore poop. Everyone has their limits too so you need to flush from time to time. Try your best to prevent the dirt meter below to be full. Otherwise, you lose and the Pooper wins.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls for keyboard:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left &amp; Right arrow keys</strong>\u00a0to move.</li><li><strong>Spacebar</strong> to flush.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls for touch and mouse input:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Touch/Click</strong> the <strong>left &amp; right zones</strong> to move.
