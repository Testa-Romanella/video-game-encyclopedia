The bird is about the size of a Triceratops, but it is still smaller than a human being, and is called an 'adult' panda in the game.\n\nThe panda is an in-depth look at the lives of lonely and specialised species.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nIts name is Emu and it is the only species that can fly, swim, climb trees, climb cliffs, and climb through chimneys. The panda can also survive on forest floor by using the hollow-sleeping ability and she is capable of food caching and raiding other animals, too.\n\nIt has a fancy name: it's called Emu because it can speak Chinese, 'Chinese literature' or'weird chanting'.\n\nThe war hero attempts to aid the panda in the simplest possible way. The panda wants to be a warrior, to help humanity in the age of advanced technology.\n\nAs of now Emu is only available in English, but one hopes that the developer will offer subtitles for other languages in the future.\n\nThe game is on iOS and Android, but will be available for the Go App Store. The main player is Emon, a male farmer travelling from his village to the city of Sichuan, to find a new farm to sell the tares for the winter.\n\nThe game is game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:32:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a609573910782faf0eb5b9fecd854249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
