CAN. NOT. GO. ON. DATES. And they should feel bad for trying. They're just too different from humans to fit in. I mean, they don't eat. They don't drink. Hell, they don't even <em>breath</em>. Good riddance. <br/></p>\n<p>Your mission? Well... You have to help our Ghost friend go on a date. It'll take some trickery, subterfuge, and perhaps even a bit of bamboozlement to get your way through a date with the girl of your dreams. \u00a0It will be tough; after all, it's pretty obvious you're a ghost. It's up to you to fit in as a normal boyfriend and fake your way through this date! <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space - breath<br/>E - Eat<br/>D - Drink<br/></p>\n<p>This is a submission for the Halloween Game Jam 2021<br/>Theme: Ghosts doing normal human things<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Jaxon Lee (GidntSquia) - Designed and created <br/>Daniel Grammer - Original music<br/></p>\n<p>\"Ghost Jam Music\"<br/>\u00a0by Daniel Grammer, created from scratch during Game Jam <br/></p>\n<p><strong>CounterTempo Studios</strong><br/>Jaxon Lee (GidntSquia) - Project manager / lead programmer<br/>Daniel Grammer<br/>Evan Powers<br/>Davin Wambogo<br/>Jeremy Kuznetsov<br/>Isaac Hill<br/>James Espericueta<br/></p>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>- Unity Chan!
