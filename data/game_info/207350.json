And I know it is crap.</p>\n<p>But i hope to improve in next games. So any help or suggestions are appreciated.</p>\n<p>Also besides below average graphics, I also am weak in sound implementation. Hence this game does not contains any audio. But I may implement in updates (probably). I will try to include audio in next .</p>\n<p>So please look forward to playing my games.</p>\n<p>**It takes a while to load the game so please be patient. And sorry for the window size.
