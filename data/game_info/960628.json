It has a simple and rough level system, which is the whole game. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Most Prominent Big Monsterrrrr ! ! !</h3>This is an Idle game where you can feel your <strong>Presence</strong> fully. With the \"Show Off\" function, you can break through the dimensional wall in the form of <strong>custom text</strong> and display your inner beast to your <strong>STEAM Friends List</strong>!<h3>Most richest Little Imagination</h3>In future development, I would like to add various casual games with classic mechanisms (such as vertical-scrolling shooting games, platform jumping, classic poker, etc.), and incorporate elements of roguelike and unlimited challenges, allowing it to have a small body and big content.<h3>Most thirsty for creativity Big Plan</h3>This is a small game that is designed for high customization from the beginning, and we also plan to launch a workshop in the future (where you can freely import game backgrounds, add casual games you want, and express your unique sense of existence!).please give me feedback in the community on how to improve it. Let's make this idea into a delicious snack together.<br/>if It brought you a little bit of fun, please leave a review so more gamer can know and join in this crazy party!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T03:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/166/166bb50192989c4981cb62414697791b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LionCat"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LionCat"], "esrb_rating": null}
