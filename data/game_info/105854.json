This release came over 40 years into Davis' career, during a period when American blues and folk music was experiencing something of a revival and people like Davis were sought out for their authenticity. Davis was born in 1896, and throughout his career performed a great number of covers and reworkings of traditional blues, ragtime and gospel standards alongside his own original songs right up until his death in 1972. It is in the spirit of tribute, and with no intention of profiting or detracting from his beautiful work, that I have used his recording here. A recording that means a great deal to me and that without which, Hurry The Sorry Word would simply not exist in its current form. I hope that Mr Davis would be ok with this if he were still with us. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/852b7837ca49c17e9eddaf49da63f5ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nate Gallardo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
