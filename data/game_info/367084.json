Face the looping threat and the greatest danger of all - the Alzheimer's disease that devours Alan's world.<br/><br/>Understand better the struggle of this disease. Fight the Alzheimer's monster and realize what is the most important in life.<br/><br/><h3>Understand Alzheimer's disease</h3><br/>The exploration of a very mysterious disease from a different perspective: inside the mind of the victim. Explore and understand how Alzheimer's disease can feel to those affected in a touching and personal story<br/><br/><h3>A story-driven adventure</h3><br/>Get to know the story of Alan while solving mind-tricking puzzles in a platformer world plagued by the disease which try to rip everything apart<br/><br/><br/><h3>Accessible</h3><br/>The game mechanics are not ability related. Solve the puzzles with your brain and not with your hands!<br/><br/><h3>Representing Alzheimer's disease in the game</h3><br/>Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease which is incurable. LETHE shows the disease from a new perspective: the game, seen as an adventure, makes the player fight its symptoms. However, the symptoms advance through the story making the game harder to understand as the player progresses.<br/><br/>Lethe digs into the mind of a patient focusing on their feelings and transforms those symptoms into game mechanics:<br/><ul><li> The fear of being lost and not understanding surroundings<br/></li><li> Confusing environments and misplaced objects<br/></li><li> Loving ones losing patience with the victim<br/></li><li> Exploration becomes scary and leading to panic attacks</li></ul><br/>The game that we are developing has a clear message: the victims have a monster in their minds, but they are still able to love and be loved. The leitmotiv of the game is expressed by this conversation:<br/><ul><li> The close ones: Do you know who I am?<br/></li><li> The victim: I don't, but I know I love you very much</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fc11ef2f31bf0d5bba3d5c19d22a60.jpg", "website": "https://www.cuatromonosgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cuatro Monos Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cuatro Monos Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
