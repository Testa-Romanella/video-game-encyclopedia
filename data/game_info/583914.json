Ten stages of increasing challenge amidst black holes, time limits, and the usual block-puzzling convolutions await you...<br/></p>\n<p>I'm certain you've played <em>something</em> a little similar before, so I have faith you'll figure out the intricacies. See you on the leaderboards!<br/><br/>In case it's unclear in-game, here are the controls:<br/></p>\n<p><em>Left Click</em> - Place Piece<em>Right Click </em>- Rotate Piece<em>Middle Click / Left Click away from the Grid</em> - Hold Piece<br/><br/>If something doesn't feel quite right I implore you to download the game instead; definitely runs better as just an executable. In fact - I think most of my games do! Though if something breaks outright... Let me know about it...
