When he reached the end of the river, the source turned out to be a grotto. Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through and the passage eventually reached a peaceful village with animals and people of all ages.</p>\n<p>There are two totally contrasting-atmosphere worlds that shows what is described in the fable, connected by the cave. The player starts his journey on a river, then goes through a cave, and finally reaches the peach blossom spring. The story begins with a dark and sad environment, and ends at a bright and happy utopia.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e909b1e1e34dd8d09e5a0d02cdaa73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jialuz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
