{"id": 522986, "slug": "narrow-escape", "name": "Narrow Escape", "name_original": "Narrow Escape", "description": "Narrow Escape is an indie horror game in which you try to escape from different buildings alone or with up to three other players without being killed by a monster.<br/>You play in the first person perspective and look for the three fuses and the master key to escape from the respective building.<br/>You can try it alone or with up to three other players. But the more you are, the greater the chances of escaping.<br/>There are also more points to be earned when playing with multiple players.<h3>Escape</h3>Goal: Try to escape the building you are trapped inside. Therefore, you will need three fuses (red, green and blue) which are distributed randomly in the rooms.<br/>To search the rooms, you must crack the lock with your pickgun (which you always have along with you) in case you don\u2019t have the right key with you fortuitously.<br/>Using the pickgun also slowly reduces its performance. But don't worry ... you can restore the pickgun's performance during the game.<h3>But beware!</h3>Don't be killed by the monster walking through the building. As soon as a door is unlocked, the monster can break through it. If you're killed, it's over for you. Unless you have a first aid kit with you. Then you get a second chance.<h3>Upgrade your pickgun</h3>Improve the pickgun of your characters individually in order to be able to charge faster and to create more capacity.<h3>Escape Route</h3>Gradually complete your missions to get more points. You can complete one mission per session.<h3>More characters</h3>Collect points and your level will rise. The higher your level, the more characters you can unlock.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T02:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be06f6008e08dc3ce43eb9e5c34b8fc.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/whitekeyframe", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["White Keyframe"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["White Keyframe"], "esrb_rating": null}
