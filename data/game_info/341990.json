Over the following years, Helen\u2019s earnest belief in my early attempts at creative writing\u00a0 gave me the motivation to pursue them seriously and, eventually, to figure out just what to do with my life. Among all the cliche emo poetry and bad stories I wrote at this time was this sonnet for Helen. It\u2019s pretty embarrassing, but it also reminds me just how much she grounded me.</em></p>\n<p>This is only the second time I've tried to make a Bitsy game and some of the things I wanted to do were more complicated than I realised. I'm indebted to ruin's image to bitsy tool for making this doable in the time frame I had.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T04:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/35117d5aa14abf179da7947b9e060538.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
