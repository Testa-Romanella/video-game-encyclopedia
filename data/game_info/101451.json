{"id": 101451, "slug": "pax-britannica", "name": "Pax Britannica", "name_original": "Pax Britannica", "description": "<p>Pax Britannica is a one-button real-time strategy game by <em>No Fun Games</em>. Up to four players battle it out underwater, struggling to be the last one standing! The game was created for the  GAMMA4 one-button design competition in 2010, and has been featured at Kill Screen Arcade (during SXSW) and Prince of Arcade.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The A, F, H, and L keys control the four players, and the escape key quits. Gamepads are also supported, although not on OS X (sorry). </p>\n<p> Holding down the button spins the needle on the radial menu in the middle of the player's factory ship. The needle will only travel as far as the player's current resources allow. Resources (gold? seaweed? who knows!) accumulate over time. </p>\n<p> Releasing the button creates a ship that corresponds to the quadrant that the needle is pointing at. </p>\r\n   Fighter: Small, fast and cheap. Great at chasing down bombers.    Bomber: Shoots slow projectiles that do massive damage to frigates or enemy factory ships!    Frigate: A great hulk of a ship that fires volleys of heat-seeking torpedoes. Effective against fighters.    Upgrade: Improve your factory ship to accumulate resources more quickly.  \r\n<p> Ships you spawn fight automatically using the latest in artificial aquatelligence technology. The player who keeps their factory ship alive wins! </p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game Design and Programming <ul><li> Renaud B\u00e9dard, Kira Boom, Matthew Gallant </li></ul> </li><li>Artwork<ul><li>Daniel Burton</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Ben Abraham</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c93ba048b4aba4b9d7e4fb3428c0f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matthew Gallant"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
