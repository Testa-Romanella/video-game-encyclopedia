If he can get close to their commanders, perhaps war can be prevented\u2026 one way or another.  <br/><br/>The Prologue lets you play the full first act of the game with the Berkana Tournament: 6 qualification battles, 5 adjutants to defeat, and one mighty champion. Every qualification and adjutant also has an extra tough optional challenge version of their fight, for additional rewards! Build winning decks of characters, equipment, and spells and use them to tackle a series of carefully crafted challenges. In the full game there are four factions to pick cards from, and you will unlock the ability to buy new cards! You will already learn how to upgrade your favorite cards The Prologue. <br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293460/Ash_of_Gods_The_Way/<br/><br/>As you progress you\u2019ll meet new characters and have opportunities for conversation. The choices you make here can change the course of the future. But success on the field of battle matters too: prepare carefully for key battles with major characters because you\u2019ll only get a few chances before defeat will change the course of the story - though the game continues\u2026 <br/><br/><br/><br/>The core gameplay is deceptively simple: every turn you can play one warrior, and one support card, then all your units will advance towards the enemy and attack if they can! But the challenge comes in what combinations you choose, how you build your deck, and when you hold back cards for a better opportunity. Your opponents play by the same rules\u2026 most of the time. Each battle can have different rules or special features that can be exploited by smart deck building!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Warriors range from front line brutes to fragile archers and supporting spellcasters. Equipment cards buff warriors on the battlefield, while spells can aid your fighters or harm the enemy. There\u2019s no one way to play - build a deck that uses tough fighters with armor and healing to grind down your opponents, roll in with high damage archers and poison wielding bandits to put down enemy warriors before they can even react, and much more. With a huge range of cards to choose from, the number of possible combinations is enormous.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Explore other games in the Ash of Gods universe! </strong><br/>Ash of Gods: The Way is our second game in the Ash of Gods universe \u2014 our first game, Ash of Gods: Redemption is a turn-based RPG with tactical combat, CCG elements and a heavily interactive story with major decisions to make which are literally life or death.
