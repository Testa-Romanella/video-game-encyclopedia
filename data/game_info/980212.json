I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bunnies and carrots as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ bunnies and carrots, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h3>Controls:</h3>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h3>Difficulty:</h3>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you have unlimited, unrestricted hints if you get stuck. Using hints will not ruin your score, or affect your ability to unlock achievements. Play at your own pace!<h3>Get immersed:</h3>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bunnies and carrots!.<h3>Replayable</h3>You can restore a small number of bunnies and carrots back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2798290/I_commissioned_some_bunnies_3/?utm_source=DescConvBunnies3", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T07:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f6805d1d52575795ea33d031c97574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
