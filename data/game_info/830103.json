{"id": 830103, "slug": "soul-shard", "name": "Soul Shard", "name_original": "Soul Shard", "description": "Soul Shard is a 3D platformer, 2-player local coop game set in a Victorian London Steampunk factory. Young Nimue, a 12-year old child inventor, and her sidekick Ambrose, a cyborg bear of her invention, are on a mission to destroy the factory so that it can no longer produce cyborg laborers that the owner has been using to replace the working class. The game uses an \"artifact\" placement mechanic that creates dynamically generated platforms which vary in shape and size depending on the use of one to three artifacts. The artifact placement, and therefore platforms, are generated by Ambrose while Nimue has the ability to change their nature. They use these platforms to progress through the factory by solving puzzles and facilitating Nimue's avoidance of the cyborg enemies. They will complete their mission successfully by destroying \"The Assembler\" in the final puzzle challenge.<br/><br/>The four types of platforms include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Static - Defies gravity and remains in a fixed position in mid-air<br/></li><li>Bounce - Allows characters to bound on it, and allows Nimue's momentum to create a more significant bounce<br/></li><li>Gravity - Is affected by physics, including gravity, but can also be used as a lever<br/></li><li>Ghost - Temporarily renders Nimue invisible to the enemy cyborgs</li></ul><br/>We appreciate any and all feedback including the metrics provided by Steam, but please be aware that this is a game with intentionally limited scope, intended to highlight the talents of the team and to support their portfolios. Gameplay is short, but we hope to present a finely polished product in the final outcome.<br/><br/>We welcome you and thank you for taking the time to look at our game. <br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>19 Souls on Board", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T04:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc7a312e72572844619165d829b4ac9b.jpg", "website": "https://www.19soulsonboard.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["19 Souls on Board"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["19 Souls on Board"], "esrb_rating": null}
