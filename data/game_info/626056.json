Alone in the skies you must survive by fighting off endless attacks from the enemy. Your perilous mission is to destroy the enemy aircraft carrier based at sea. You must do this at all costs. It may take several days to find the carrier during which you will be under constant fire from all sides. A fuel plane will be sent to you each day, it will approach alone, glide up behind it carefully. If you can re-fuel completely you will gain a bonus protective shield. The fighting will be fast and furious and you will be alone against the enemy. This is all the help I can give, the rest is up to you!
