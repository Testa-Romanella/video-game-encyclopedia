You don't need to be wealthy in reality, you can just spend a few dollars on this virtual reality game and you will know how it would like. You will have a helicopter, a garden, a grand villa (in which you can interact with furnitures), a swimming pool, a lot of maids, an endless California manor that you have to visit in a hot air balloon as it is too big, a hunting ground in Southeast Asia where you hunt for fun, and a nightclub where beauties are dancing. These are your properties in VR! And of course, you will have to exercise while hunting and balloon flying.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T02:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/67704d2cbd438f5b880bce7d02ab7c46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William at Oxford"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["William at Oxford"], "esrb_rating": null}
