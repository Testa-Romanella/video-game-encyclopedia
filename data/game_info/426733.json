I made it in 50 hours using Unity. I currently use Godot now to make games, so this MAY be my last Unity game.<br/> </p>\n<p>It includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Several singleplayer levels where you're running from an entity trying to kill you.</li><li>2 local multiplayer levels (1 randomly generated) where you get to run with other people.</li><li>A whole lot of fun for the family.</li></ul>\n<p>* I uploaded this game before, but I took it down because I didn't think it was all that great, and wasn't sure if I would get in trouble using someone else's music (which was a free demo on the audio creation software that I use). I even deleted the project that I used, so I can't make any more changes to the game. However, looking back on the game, I now actually think it's pretty good, so I have decided to reupload it. Thank you to anyone who is reading this, or to the one's that download shady looking games like these and play them. I do hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:39:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b1486e78b97be7cbba90416927b5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Wilson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
