I focused on building a huge world filled with a diverse range of characters and factions, but\u00a0ripped a lot of art and music from other games (as was common in the RPG Maker community at that time). I also learned the basic concepts of scripting game logic.</p>\n<p>The games were heavily inspired by the\u00a0Suikoden\u00a0series, with regards to setting, theme, as well as the gameplay systems of recruiting characters into your army, governing a castle and engaging in large-scale battles.</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li><strong>Discord</strong></li><li><strong>Facebook</strong></li><li><strong>Reddit</strong></li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nGames\r\nLegion Saga\r\n\n\r\nLegion Saga II\r\n\n\r\nLegion Saga III\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nUnfinished Games\r\n<p>In addition to the main three games in the series, I also started making two more using RPG Maker 2003.
