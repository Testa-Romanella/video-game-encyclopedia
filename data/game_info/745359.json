{"id": 745359, "slug": "conways-game-of-life-coastalerosion", "name": "Conway's Game of Life (coastalerosion)", "name_original": "Conway's Game of Life (coastalerosion)", "description": "<p>The\u00a0<em><strong>Game of Life</strong></em> was first created in 1970\u00a0by British\u00a0mathematician <strong>John Conway</strong>, who was working at the University of Cambridge (before he was later appointed to the\u00a0John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at\u00a0Princeton\u00a0University).\u00a0It is a zero-player game, which means that it naturally evolves from an initial state and requires no more\u00a0input.</p>\n<p>It is interesting, however, to see how different initial states evolve and which sort of patterns regularly emerge.</p>\n<p>The gameboard consists of\u00a0a grid of square cells: each one can be either alive or dead. The evolutionary lifecycle of each cell over the course of the game depends on the state of its neighbouring cells.</p>\n<p>If a cell is currently alive, it can be killed by <strong>overpopulation</strong> if more than three of its neighbouring\u00a0cells are also alive; likewise, it can be killed by <strong>underpopulation</strong> if fewer than two of its neighbouring cells are alive. If a cell is currently dead, it can\u00a0\u00a0come back to life by <strong>reproduction</strong> if exactly three of its neighbouring cells are alive.</p>\n<p>The three simple rules listed above (i.e. overpopulation, underpopulation and reproduction)\u00a0are enough to\u00a0create all of the complex interactions that you will see in the game.</p>\n<p>In order to make patterns easier to spot, I have introduced a colour-coding system. Cells that are currently alive and were also alive in the previous frame are painted black. Cells that have recently come to life\u00a0(i.e. they are currently alive and were dead in the previous frame) are painted dark red. Cells that have recently died (i.e. they are currently alive and were dead in the previous frame) are painted violet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T12:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/567786aa582fac331944b044739edb0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["coastalerosion"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
