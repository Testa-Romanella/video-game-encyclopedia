Let's prove them otherwise! In this very short game you have to fly with your rocket to Mars within 20 seconds. Evade incoming enemy ships, asteroids and the gravity of the sun to reach Mars as fast as possible. Good luck, Commander!</p>\n\r\nLeaderboard\r\n<p>If you reached Mars within 20 seconds, take a  screenshot and post it in the comments to get on the leaderboard!
