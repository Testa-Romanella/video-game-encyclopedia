It tells the story of a settlement in the New World and all the difficulties encountered by the early settlers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Each city will expand the possibilities of the game and increase the difficulty of the conditions, such as the weather, the number of possible expeditions, and the size of the ships with which he trades with England. <br/><br/>Colonize will have six cities the player must populate: <strong>Roanoke, Plymouth, Bermuda, Boston, Williamsburg, and Providence.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Colonize is a building simulation that centers on the economy, management of population groups, and city management. It is an isometric classic. The player gradually builds a settlement, a city with the character of a city-state, with everything that goes with it. Slowly, you will make various building improvements, new raw materials, laws, forms of government, and city management.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Please be aware that this is a projected Roadmap for Colonize development. There are more minor improvements and bug fixes on our list. We would like to hear more from gamers about what they want to have in the game to change in the upcoming releases.
