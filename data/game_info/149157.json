This will cause the enemy to move while you can keep your current position. Also, in the case where you and the enemy would hit each other simultaneously, you will always deal damage first. This means if the enemy would be killed, you won't take any damage. Remember that using Shift to turn doesn't allow the enemy to hit you.
