Super Smash Bros. crossed our minds since we had been playing it for a while recently and so we decided to explore how it would be to create something like it but in 3D, and our own take on brawl games.<br/><br/>Of course we encountered many hardships, things we didn't know, having to work as the 7 we didn't have in our group and disciplined deadlines and communication skills.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0With a lot of dedication and passion for the game industry,\u00a0we made it through and the game was showcased at the Technical Museum of Stockholm for 1 week.<br/><br/>We could write an entire 3 books about all the things we learned, what we now know\u00a0should be the focus when making games and the importance of being a great team. \u00a0Of course there are are tons of things we would like to redo and reiterate on - a game is never finished but at some point you have to know when to stop in order to continue the rest.\u00a0We believed we could do anything and in the end we gave it our best, respected each other's work and were quite proud of the outcome.\u00a0<br/><br/>Artist &amp; Level Designer: Ther\u00e9se Eriksson\u00a0<br/>Programmer &amp; VFX: Gleb Kornienko<br/>Music: David Eriksson<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/531/531128279e6655f612f299b5452166b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Good Bois"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
