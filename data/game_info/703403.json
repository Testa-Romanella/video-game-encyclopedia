You get a 16 page PDF of lore, continent details, a starting area and more, all designed to give you stepping stones to put your own spin on a campaign. <br/><br/>Be aware that this isn't a full setting guide, this is designed to work in tandem with Aether's session 0 kit to get your group playing the game you want as quickly as possible. It can also be used in other TTRPGs, as the material is highly system-agnostic. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de0494c9a113868c0a469e0a4ac9abef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EldritchCrow"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
