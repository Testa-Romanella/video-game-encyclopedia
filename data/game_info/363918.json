It's 2d and narrative driven with combat that resembles bullet-hell games. (c-c-can you say UnDERtale) The puzzle part is more \"where do i go and what do i do\" than\u00a0 solving a rubik's cube. I tried to make this part intuitive instead of hand-holding. The player can make multiple choices that result in the life/death of specific characters. There are also different ways of proceeding in the game. There is no sound. At all :D. I was just too lazy to add it when I was \"done\" with the other things.\u00a0 Leave a comment if you have feedback or confusion about how the game progresses.\u00a0 Oh and **there is no save system**, so don't close the game if you want to keep playing where you left off.</p>\n<p>Please read the readme before starting the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Download: https://poordoor.itch.io/k</p><p>Some gameplay: https://gfycat.com/badsentimentaldalmatian<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/58446b32a7684333fbf1c256b120373a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poordoor"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
