And the top-down view. </li><li><strong>Souls-like: </strong>For a challenging but well-balanced game. Rewards players' efforts, especially when they show off their skills.</li></ul></ul><h3>What's in Spellz?</h3><ul><ul><li><strong>12 levels</strong>, across <strong>4 kingdoms</strong>, each with its own universe and enemies.</li><li><strong>6 different bosses</strong> with their own behaviors and attacks.</li><li><strong>30 spells</strong> that change the way you play.</li><li><strong>30 runes</strong> offering great variety for each run.</li></ul></ul>... and many more to come in the next few months!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T07:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eeb/eeb458c343237a453b06dc7047f35a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tom Medina"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CreepyCraft Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
