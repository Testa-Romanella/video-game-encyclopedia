You can grind, warp, boost and slam your friends all over the ring and off into the depths of space.<br/></p><p><strong>Important:</strong></p><p><strong>Controllers are REQUIRED</strong></p><p><strong>You will want to grab at least one friend and plug in some controllers to play. More chaotic fun ensues as you add more players up to four.</strong></p><p><strong>Gamemodes:</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Infinite stock</strong> - I live, I die, I live again!

Don't keep holding it though, as it has a 5 second cooldown!</p><p><strong>Right Trigger</strong> - Press and hold to grab on a Line! Make sure you are <strong>PARALLEL</strong> to grab. The closer on the line you grab, the more charged your boost engines are when you jump off! If you are not sure when to grab just pull when you see the <strong>Green Light </strong>on your ship light up.</p><p><strong>Y Button</strong> - Hold to charge warp which has a 10 second cooldown. If the line is yellow when you let go, warp will cancel, if the line is red, warp will engage!

If it hits your ship it will do a 180 degree turn and all your momentum will carry with you!<br/></p><p><strong>Select Button - </strong>Turn off or on easy mode which allows you to hold the right trigger to grab well before you get to the line. Remember, you still need to be <strong>parallel</strong> to the line to grab!<br/></p><p><strong>Start Button (First Player Only)</strong> - Pause the game and allows you to change modes and maps.<br/></p><p><strong>Other Gameplay Details:</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Stun - </strong>If you are hit hard your ship will be stunned!
