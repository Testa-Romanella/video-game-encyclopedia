Their goal: to relieve this castle of all its treasures. Through winding corridors, past guards and traps, they make their way to the vault. But as they grab their prize, a shout goes up, and the chase is on. At least there are no dead ends with enough gunpowder. At last the group explodes into the night, treasure in hand, safe \u2013 at least until their next heist.<br/></p>\n<p>Round Robbin\u2019 is a medieval heist-em-up focused on dastardly plans, stealthy manoeuvres, and watching it all go horribly wrong. \r\n<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Keyboard - Join with any button<ul><li>Movement: WASD</li></ul><ul><li>Aim: Mouse</li><li>Attack: Space</li></ul></li><li>Controller - Join with any button<ul><li>Movement: Left Stick</li><li>Aim: Right Stick</li><li>Attack: Right Trigger</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T10:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2909c5380288b64196c0aa2c4cb6d46b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoidAwake", "leaire", "BiggerestBoy", "ItsRaijin", "AGLtaria"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
