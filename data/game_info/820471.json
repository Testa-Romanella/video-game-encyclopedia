Once you've earned the ability in a level you can then revisit any previous levels with your newfound skills!\u00a0Good luck and happy collecting!</p>\n\n<p>This project was my submission to\u00a0the GMTK 2022 Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394d1e17102d38f143cc0d589e587144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gemster312"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
