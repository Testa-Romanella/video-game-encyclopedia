{"id": 54242, "slug": "sensible-soccer", "name": "Sensible Soccer", "name_original": "Sensible Soccer", "description": "<p>Sensible Soccer, often affectionately known as Sensi, is a football video game series which was highly popular in the early 1990s and which still retains a cult following. Developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1992 as well as for the PC, it featured a zoomed-out bird&#39;s-eye view (most games until then such as Kick Off and Matchday used a closer top-down or side view), editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a relatively simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as Amiga Power&#39;s &quot;All Time Top 100&quot;. The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega Lo Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.<br />\nOn 12 November 2015, a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to Sensible Soccer, Sociable Soccer, was announced by Jon Hare, and early versions for PC, mobile and Virtual Reality were shown at 9 different public venues across Europe, including Gamescom in Cologne and the London Science Museum in 2016, with development still continuing despite an initially unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Sociable Soccer was released on Steam Early Access on 12 October 2017, with PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android versions to follow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T13:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/0232ea9caef5df63b6ae282d8365faf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["SNES", "Genesis", "Commodore / Amiga", "SEGA CD"], "developers": ["Sensible Software"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Renegade Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
