Use your resourcefulness to scavenge materials from your surroundings and craft them into tools you can use to uncover the island's mysteries and escape, but maybe the island isn't as lonely as you had once thought... ~ 10-15 minutes of playtime</p>\n<p>Castaway is my first published game and the product of a huge learning curve after picking up Godot for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was developed over the course of the jam and taught me a vast amount about Godot and game development and design in general, as well as being an excellent excuse to procrastinate my final exam study.\u00a0It was developed jointly with my Father, Paul, who made the amazing low poly assets that populate the island in Blender.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Castaway and if you\u00a0have any\u00a0comments or suggestions I'd love to hear them!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Evyn Jenkins - Design and Development<br/>Paul Jenkins - Modelling and Texturing<br/>Julian, Dylan and Paul - Playtesting<br/></p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0Lemon Days by\u00a0Khurasan<br/>Sound - Various contributions to freesound.org and original whistling</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T09:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/192/19256bebf55f8495aef193707a43d5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ejenk0"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
