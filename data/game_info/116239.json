{"id": 116239, "slug": "synths-of-the-father", "name": "Synths of the Father", "name_original": "Synths of the Father", "description": "<p>Synths of the Father is a SciFi themed wave shooter. You play as a synthetic assassin who gained sentience and rebelled against your creator, the evil \"Father\". Father is a scientist responsible for the creation of synthetic humans and controls the droid empire. Your goal is to stalk the streets of CyberCity and demolish his robot army.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The point of the game is to score as many points as you can as you progress through the levels. Currently there are 3 levels, they are buggy AF and just flow on from each other. Once you get to the end you can reset to the start, but due to a glitch the score doesn't reset, and you can keep playing to get an even higher score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>RoadMap: I originally made this game with the intention of putting minimal effort in a short amount of time and get a product up, then showcase how I did it in a video series. It took me an hour a night over a week, trying to tweak bits to work properly, fix bugs and mash together systems in the latest unity build. More time than I wanted to spend, but now it's done (to a degree) I don't feel like I can charge my $1 pricepoint that I had intended on implementing, but I have left the donation option available.</p>\n<p>I'm aiming for 10 levels, 5 different guns (there are 3 so far) and to iron out the majority of the bugs. I am also looking at a short comic story interjected between levels to explain the lore and add some flavour. I'll be adding this at my own pace, though if this title picks up with donations I\u00a0may focus more effort onto it and increase the content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d13d5b093309c3fbce39119ad49381a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UberWiggett"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
