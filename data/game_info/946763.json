This and other random variables will make each playthrough different.</p>\n<p>There are 13 endings, but you will have to be a certain age and sex to get all of them.</p>\n<p>A lot in this game has been left to chance, as this game was apart of the MigJam #7. This theme for this Jam is All Luck No Skill. This game took me 1 week to make.<br/></p>\n<p>Ill put a list down here with everything luckbased in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>The stats with which you spawn (Age and sex). Based on these you get different height, speed, jump and dialog which result in different endings.</li><li>Every minute or so there are random events that happen. There is a 33% chance it happens every minute, and you will notice it while playing the game (no spoilers).</li><li>Certain actions you do can fail. Sometimes based on your stats, but sometimes its just pure luck. When you suddenly die of something, youre just unlucky.</li></ul>\n<p>So remember, when something doesnt work the first time, it could work the second time, you never know<br/></p>\n<p>The music in this game is all custom made, except for the dance music in the cinema. That was made by Mokka: https://www.youtube.com/@MokkaMusic<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any questions, bugs or feedback, leave them in the comments. Enjoy the game and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T05:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bc23ee763e1484944563f98b110573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frosti Frog Productions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
