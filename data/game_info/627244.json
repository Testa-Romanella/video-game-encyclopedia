This means that the player walks on the board in between the chess pieces. The player can move their chess pieces using the terminal on the backside of the chess piece.<br/>The game is turn based so after player 1\u00a0makes his/her move player 2\u00a0can then follow up with their move. The gameplay is inspired from the chess game in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)\".</p>\n<p>Theme: The room where the game takes place has a medieval theme to it.</p>\n<p>This is my graduation project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2795aad103bba4738d6871ae84b0ec8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaanVerschraegen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
