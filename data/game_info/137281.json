They come in <strong>waves</strong>, each wave being separated from the next by a few seconds. <br/><strong>You start the game with 3 Hit Points (HP)</strong>, every collision with an asteroid will take you 1 HP (no matter its size), and <strong>if your HP reaches 0 it\u2019s game over</strong>.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Destroying asteroids will earn you points, and you\u2019ll lose some for each asteroids that reaches the bottom of the screen (it won\u2019t affect your HP).\r\n<strong> Each time you survive 5 waves in a row without taking a single hit, a bonus will appear at the top :</strong> picking it up will <strong>increase your HP</strong> (not capped at 3, you can get as many as you want). It doesn\u2019t matter if asteroids reach the bottom of the play zone in the meantime, as long as you <strong>don\u2019t receive damage for 5 waves</strong> a bonus will spawn.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game never ends, unless you die of course, so <strong>aim for a high score </strong>! \u00a0But the longer you play, the harder it gets.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When the game ends, you can restart by pressing the \u201cR\u201d key. Keep in mind there's no feature to save high scores.\u00a0I'll learn\u00a0to do\u00a0that on\u00a0my next\u00a0games.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys \u2190\u2191\u2193\u2192 to move your spaceship.</li><li>Use the key \u201cX\u201d to shoot normal shots.</li><li>Press both the \u201cX\u201d and \u201cC\u201d keys to shoot in \u201cfocus\u201d mode. In focus mode you shoot a lot faster and way more precisely but your ship will move slower.</li></ul>\n\n<p>I do not think of this as my first game, as it is strongly based on Unity's official tutorial. You can learn more about the \"WHYs and HOWs\" on this dedicated post on my blog.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed62ee7c1b17dbb35500efb7e5b48b34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yamakyu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
