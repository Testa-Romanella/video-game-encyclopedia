Plagued with a curse due to his past hubris for not cleaning up after himself. He now makes amends by helping the community clean up! </p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to collect as many pieces of litter around the town before the time limit ends. Dash's goal is to get every recyclable material he can find before he tires out. Once you win, be sure to play again to see if you can beat your high score!</p>\n<p>Use the 'A, W, S, D' keys to move.
