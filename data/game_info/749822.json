There will be progression, and eventually even an ending.</p>\n<p>This is a slow-burn project for me. The first release is somewhat bare-bones but has the fundamentals. As I have the time I'll be adding mechanics, plot, more characters, and raising the level cap.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:48:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430bd359f5cb74877a951133781fee67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Naka"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
