You lost control over your engines but strangely you can manipulate gravity. Use this power to avoid obstacles and collect precious meteors.</p><p>Controls :</p><p>You can manipulate the nearest obstacle to you.</p><p>Arrow keys to move obstacles.</p><p>R/T to rotate Left and Right the obstacles.</p><p>Look for the spotlight to know where you're heading.</p><p>This is one of my first Unity3D games. I had a few ideas that I wanted to try like proceduraly generated obstacles and music controlled design. I created the tetris obstacles by myself. Most of the scripts are also done by me. I used some assets from the internet, I don't claim any rights on them.<br/><br/></p><p>For any requests or bug reports you can contact me at :</p><p>email : najahi.yakin@gmail.com</p><p>twitter : @nightkenny</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/3913a7c627a311c5f3ca8b35f2d1a8f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nightkenny"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
