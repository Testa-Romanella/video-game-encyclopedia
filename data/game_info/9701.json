It\u2019s currently in alpha development, so bear with us.<br/><br/>The game takes place on Ansora Island, the epicenter of a paranormal catastrophe that took place two years before the events of the game\u2019s main storyline. The island presents players with a highly dangerous and hostile environment full of monsters, anomalies, and various hazardous global events.<br/><br/>The player is thrust into the role of a New Light Corporation volunteer, tasked with taking the first steps in their new initiative involving ongoing research into the events that transpired on the island to ascertain the root cause of the catastrophe. Players will be able to piece together the island\u2019s recent history through a variety of notes, audio records, and observable changes to the environment.<br/><br/>Your trial by fire (and more) on Ansora will begin on the island\u2019s southern shore, as you come face to face with your new, perilous home away from home...<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The world of Beyond Despair is full of dangers. Every move may lead to unexpected results, and every critical decision you make on your journey may be your last.<br/><br/>Castaways survive on an island. Inhabitants of Ansora, however, have to survive the island itself, which is no easy task by any measure. Thousands of volunteers have been sent to Ansora by the New Light Corp. \u2013 will you be the one to conquer the chaos that lies before you and solve the island\u2019s dark mystery?<br/><br/>Food and water won\u2019t be the only things you need to survive. Violent weather patterns, global events, roaming monsters, former citizens of the isle, and even ghosts will test your body, while illnesses and anomalies will ravage your mind. Think you\u2019re prepared? Others have thought the same, but Ansora had other plans for them.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to add a sense of purpose to the trying task of survival on Ansora, we\u2019ve included a primary storyline and generated a series of missions for players to take up. As you take on the role of a volunteer for the New Light Corporation, these missions will serve as a vague guideline, yielding insight into the recent events responsible for turning the island into the terrifying place it has become.<br/><br/>Features<br/><ul><li><strong>FEAR</strong>: We want \u201chorror\u201d to be more than just a buzzword, so we\u2019ve worked hard to really give our players a scare.<br/></li><li><strong>EXPLORATION</strong>: Immerse yourself into a unique setting based on industrialism, dieselpunk, and architecture from the first half of the twentieth century.<br/></li><li><strong>CRAFTING</strong>: Craft mods for guns and melee weapons, or make medical supplies, food and other consumables.<br/></li><li><strong>SURVIVAL</strong>: Watch out!
