Thank you guys, for being so patient with a newcomer like me that hadn't even touched programming prior to this.</p>\n<p>Its a bit janky since it was a learning experience to make it more than anything. Apologies for this jank. I hope you enjoy the game. And I hope you enjoy the wonderful music by Princess Sylvysprit!!</p>\n<p>A sequel is already being worked on that is higher resolution, much longer and will be a bit more distant from touhou.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>This is not a Touhou fangame and is in its own universe, so another apology if you were expecting raymoo. I went for a simple story since its my first, of a demon (named rerunes in this universe) who wishes to reach the surface even though rerunes are only permitted to visit the surface one specific day of the year. The reason? Cuz some ice cream sounds good right now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d4022e02b9ecc83875a02394514e91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethereal airport"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
