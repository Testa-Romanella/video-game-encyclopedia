Where one player can immersive themselves in a three-dimensional ground, surrounded by moving generative artworks. Time progresses to the speed of a play space, in accordance to the player\u2019s movements. There is no clear objective, and little interactive involvement. It is designed to be a simulation, simply playing with time. Players can appreciate visuals or get lost in the play space.\u00a0</p><p>The project opens into future possibilities or branches I may want to research further into. It has potential for audio, to sync visuals or becoming interactive particles for touch screen devices.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1b20b6945bd20503b822c04d90dec60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["watermingo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
