Download Firefly Sky and experience the hand drawn art and harmonizing music sound effects.  Also available on Apple TV.<br/><br/>\u2022\u2022How to play\u2022\u2022<br/>To Catch the fireflies you tap your screen to throw the jar in the air.  The longer you hold the tap the higher the jar will go.  Tilt your device left or right to move the little girl.  The jar will move with the girl even while in the air.  <br/><br/>Your aim is you catch the yellow fireflies on each level.  Each new level will have more and more fireflies. <br/><br/>Be careful of the red ones.  They fly slower but they'll make you lose a heart.  If you lose all your hearts the game is over.  Now and then a very fast pink bug will appear.  If you catch it you'll get a bonus life!<br/><br/>Every level had a bonus bug.  Each bonus bug is unique.  If you catch a bonus bug it will help you catch the yellow fireflies. One bonus bug even lets you catch the red ones!<br/><br/>\u2022\u2022About\u2022\u2022<br/>Sophia, my 13 year old daughter, hand drew the girl animation.  Firefly Sky is a collaboration between her and myself.  It's my goal to teach her graphic arts in the real world and what better way than to make a game! If you like the animation leave a review and let her know.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the hand painted background and harmonizing music sound effects.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c84cdebd7db801915b07091cf92920.jpg", "website": "http://www.sputnikgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sputnik Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["Mark Andrade"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
