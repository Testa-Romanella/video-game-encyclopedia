He must avoid obstacles such as destructible walls and fend off the robotic enemies that have taken over the B corridor using his <strong>MWB - Mulled Wine Blaster</strong> (<em>patent pending</em>). However, he needs to be conservative when using this weapon in order to prevent it from overheating.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Space</strong>: use beer-propelled jetpack<br/><strong>Left Mouse / Q: </strong>fire weapon<br/><strong>Esc: </strong>pause the game</p>\r\nCollectibles\r\n<p><strong>Beer: </strong>reduces the heat of your weapon<br/><strong>Coffee: </strong>restores health<br/><strong>1\u20ac Coin: </strong>increases score</p>\r\nPowerups\r\n<p><strong>Shield</strong>: protects you from a single source of damage.
