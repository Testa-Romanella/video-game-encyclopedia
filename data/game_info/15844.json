You see an old fire escape and scramble up to the roof of an abandoned building; you are safe here. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the patrol cars drive past, you slip into the shadows. The coast is clear, you just got away with it\u2026 or did you? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn your way back towards the fire escape, the roof gives out from under you and you plummet into darkness. You are wounded, and only equipped with a dying flashlight. Where are you? You must now escape this building. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA twisted ankle, a busted flashlight, in the middle of one of man's great casualty of progress. <br/>\r\nThis is the price you pay for avoiding the police. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt smells of death here; the stench of frustration, success and the festering of old hopes. <br/>\r\nA shuffling rises up from the infinite darkness before you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRats? No, too big for rats. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStray dogs? Squatters? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat else? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou're not hoping to find out, but you must go forth. Determined, you enter the gaping maw of obsolescence. There must be an exit... Get to the exit. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA heart pounding, anxiety inducing, paranoia paradise; 123 Slaughter Me Street is like no other. With a completely unique set of controls and limited mobility, players must have their wits about them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet to the exit, and do so swiftly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:48:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c19/c19d3ef3ee8497650009e31b501de488.jpg", "website": "http://www.impulsegamestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 126, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nate Sanders", "John Kolbek"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Impulse Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
