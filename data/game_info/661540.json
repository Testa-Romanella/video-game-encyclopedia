I hope the game is fun :3</p>\n<p><strong>---A SHORT LETTER TO VOIDSAY---</strong></p>\n<p>\"Hi Voidsay, i hope you like this small little game!!</p>\n<p>When you said \"A bit of light shining into my dungeon\" i immediately knew what to make: A game about light in a medieval settings. And yes, it may not have big explosions or a nice story that we both have hoped for,\u00a0 but for a week project it has turned out quite nicely I'd say, even if it's just 8 small levels!!\u00a0 :3</p>\n<p>The only thing i couldn't make\u00a0is the UI, that even with the spare amount of time i didn't managed to make it look good. I'll keep experimenting to see if i can manage to improve it.</p>\n<p>Alright, unless i'm forgetting\u00a0something, that should be all i wanted to say. Again, hope u have fun, stay well, and have an happy Summer Christmas.\u00a0 (^u^)</p>\n<p>Your Santa, With Love. -Marxy 37\"</p>\n<p><strong>--- CONTROLS---</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Controller</strong>MoveWASD/Arrow KeysDPad/Left StickDragSpaceButton East (Circle)KickDouble-Tap SpaceDouble-Tap B.
