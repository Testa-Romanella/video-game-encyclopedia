This game does not include combat. It\u00a0focuses primarily on level design, obstacles and missions.<br/></p>\r\nGame Overview\r\n<p>Aurora is the name of our game. It is premised around a lone wanderer in the middle of a massive storm. Our player must find a way to escape it and get to a safe zone away from the harsh elements to ensure survival.\r\n</p>\n<p>It is a 3D open world interactive environment, where the player is encouraged to make use of their surroundings to complete objectives and make it across obstacles.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player\u2019s ultimate goal is to reach the safezone to guarantee his survival. However, the main purpose of this game is to show off some of the weather elements and effects that we have created. Alongside the interactive objectives the player needs to get through we hope to bring this environment to life as much as possible while giving the player a world to interact with as well as to admire the beauty of.\r\n</p>\r\nPlot\r\n<p>Returning from a trip out of town, our hero awakes in the middle of a freak snowstorm - unlike anything this town had seen before. Whatever happened that caused him to pass out is uncertain too. He has no time to worry about that now though, as his sole purpose right now is to find shelter and safety.</p>\n<p>Before the next hit of snowstorm hits our player again, he must reach the safe zone and assure his survival.\u00a0The evacuated village has made a safe zone in the mountain. The origin of this place is yet to be uncovered but someone knew this storm was coming and made the right preparations for doomsday.</p>\n<p>The aurora borealis is more prominent than ever during this time and this is an area that can be explored further on in the full game - but for now, just acts as a beautiful visual and focal point for the environment.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/669/669b84720f28213a14613342d0450adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeyLowkey"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
