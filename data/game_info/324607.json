The player will be able to traverse left\u00a0and right as well as jump and stomp, all of which will produce sound waves. The player will avoid enemies and solve\u00a0puzzles as both enemies and interactable objects will emit their own visualized sound. Once the player overcomes the\u00a0challenge set before them, they will move onto the next stage.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Alex Cline - Producer @daRealAlexCline<br/>Steven Drovie - Programmer\u00a0@SDrovie<br/>Trent Lewis - Level Designer (I don't know his twitter handle, I'll update this when I find it).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91f838049a9bc098882ce5ba45c60eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Cline"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
