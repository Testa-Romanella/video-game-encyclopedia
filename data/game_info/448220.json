It is unrefined and the visual style is as-of-yet undecided - placeholder art is being used.\u00a0 If you like the project so far, let me know what you think and drop some feedback for me. It will help me and Beat Prison to grow and become better.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Grip Button - Grab</p>\n<p>Trigger - Grav Grab:\u00a0Hold, aim, and release to pull objects toward you from afar, after which you\u00a0can grab them</p>\n<p>Touchpad - Click in a direction to move in that direction on the grid according to the direction you are looking: you can only move on the grid forward, back, left, and right</p>\n<p>Trigger while holding a gun - Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Enemies can be defeated by being shot or being hit with a held item. Deplete their health fully to defeat them.\u00a0If you swing at an enemy, make sure your swing is wide or your hit will just glance off and do nothing to them.</p>\n<p>Enemies can damage you by moving into you. Lose all your health and get sent to the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Combo System:\u00a0</strong>As you shoot your gun and melee enemies accurately on the beat, you will build up a combo. When your combo level increases, your hands will start to emit particles to show you are doing more damage. If you perform an action off-beat, take damage, or do not move or act for too long, your combo will drop back to base level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3f0d57f77d12a5a125614ad3bdfe1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wirtwirtwirt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
