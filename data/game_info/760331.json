Armed\u00a0Bots attack all players and bots. Unarmed bots don't attack anyone but they can be killed.\r\nDescription\r\n<p>All weapons use projectiles that move slow enough that you can dodge them. Unlike a hit scan weapon, bots using a slow moving projectile weapon can't be programmed to always win so it makes the game between human and bots more fair.</p>\n<p>The projectile fires in the direction the gun is pointing so doesn't use a crosshair. Not having a crosshair makes aiming more difficult but more realistic.</p>\r\nDirections\r\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to use the same version for the client and server.</li><li>The game is multiplayer or single player with bots.</li><li>The goal is to get the high score before the countdown timer runs out.</li><li>When the countdown timer runs out, the game ends and shows the final score so you can take a screenshot for proof.</li><li>Bots can't win because they don't respawn so their score is not recorded.</li><li>If you shoot while running you can shoot yourself but you don't get credit for killing yourself.</li><li>By default bots will spawn automatically; however, you can change the defaults from the Options menu. In addition, you can press Ctrl + B on the keyboard to manually spawn bots one at a time. Only the server can spawn bots.</li><li>Weapons, Ammo, and Health Powerups respawn.</li></ul>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul>\n<li>Don't set Max bots in the Options menu too high without first trying out lower values because this can slow down the game making it unresponsive if your computer is not powerful enough. As an example, my laptop with integrated graphics couldn't handle more than 300 Max bots.</li><li>I only tested with two players so if anyone tries more let me know how the performance works.</li></ul>\r\nV1.0\r\n<ul>\n<li>3-27-2022</li></ul>\r\nTechnical\r\n<ul>\n<li>Unreal Engine Version 4.26</li>\n</ul>\r\nDesign\r\n<p>The following games led up to\u00a0this game.</p>\r\n\r\n1BotMultiFightMy first multiplayer game.2BotMultiFightBMultiplayer with Mixamo Animation Pack and 15 unique bots.3BotMultiFightCMultiplayer with Animation\u00a0Starter Pack.4MultiFightCityMultiplayer with low poly city map.5MultiFightAMultiplayer with multiple maps.\r\n6MultiFightBMultiplayer with 9 unique low poly bots.7ShootProtoDemoMultiplayer TPS prototype.\r\n\r\nAssets\r\n<ul>\n<li>Epic Games Multiplayer Shootout</li><li>Epic Games Animation Starter Pack</li>\n<li>POLYGON - City Pack</li>\n<li>Military Weapons Silver</li>\n</ul>\r\nSetup\r\n<p>Unreal Engine 4 Listen Server Multiplayer Setup</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe61e08ef567d8d7b930adaa1ab4089.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bradcodetips"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
