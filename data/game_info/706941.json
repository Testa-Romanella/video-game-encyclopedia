You are a general with a wide overview of the battlefield to use for commanding your forces. Units are used to capture strategic points, allowing the player to grow their power over time. These bases will produce units to help overcome the challenges in your way. A delicate balance between unit types and their micromanagement are the key elements of this game, with the player micromanaging both as the main avenue to victory.</p>\n<p>A series of levels in a single-player campaign style is the way the game will be played, with the player being put in difficult situations against an AI. The player must use the units and strategic points available to him to fight the battles which lie ahead. Each level is unique in terrain and bases to compete over. Tactics will determine who is the winner in the end.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls/How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Left-click and Drag to highlight and select units.\r\n</p>\n<p>Double left-click to specify that unit type.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once the units are highlighted, right click to move.\r\n</p>\n<p>Right-click on enemy will attack that enemy and nearby enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>Double right-click on an enemy to specifically target that enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hitting 1, 2, and 3 will change to automatic lock-on range of units, where 1 is full range, 2 is half range, and 3 is no lock-on, but will attack if in range.\r\n</p>\n<p>Left-click a base to select it, where 1-5 will change to unit spawned(1: Pikeman, 2: Swordsman, 3: Archer, 4: Shield, 5: Cavalier) and right-click to make the move to that spot on spawn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Post-Mortem</strong></p>\n<p>What went right</p>\n<ul><li>Making multiple units is integral to making an RTS game interesting.\u00a0Without it, strategy would be very minimal.</li><li>Bases were easily implemented and worked well despite being very simple.</li><li>Levels could easily be made after all units and bases were done.<ul><li>Tile sets easy to implement and design with once everything was implemented.</li><li>Game maker allowing layers to become invisible allowed for seamless integration of \r\nwalls and tileset sprites.</li></ul></li><li>Modular parts made things easy to change. Especially late in the process, making new levels was incredibly easy without our modular design.</li><li>Art was good enough for the time we had.</li></ul>\n<p>What went Wrong</p>\n<ul><li>Work in the beginning was slow so we had to pick up on lost time in the latter half of the project.</li><li>Art direction was an afterthought for most of the project timeline\r\n</li><li>Team organization was slow in the beginning. No real team meetings were held until the second half of the project.</li><li>Movement, both with and without walls, was hard to figure out and took up much of the time of the programming end of the project, leaving less time to finish more basic aspects such as level design.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Major Changes over the course of the project</p>\n<ul><li>We were originally going to integrate Commander and Catapult units with special spawn requirements and special attributes.\u00a0However, due to time constraints, they had to be scrapped to meet deadlines.</li><li>Originally, we were going to have specific unit formations in the game, being best for different strategies.</li><li>The maps were originally going to be much larger. Theoretically requiring some sort of minimap functionality. This was eventually scrapped due to time and resources.</li></ul>\n<p>Major Lessons Learned</p>\n<ul><li>We learned on how complicated\u00a0movement can be with a horde of player units and how much time has to be dedicated to it to make it work well.</li><li>Coordinating a group is difficult due to different work times and work ethics. Especially early in the project where not a lot of work was completed simply due to the group rarely finding times to meet and discuss what needed to be done.</li></ul>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p><strong>Level Tilesets/Sprites:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Medieval RTS (120+) by www.kenney.nl\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/medieval-rts-120\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Flags by Nekith\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/flags-0\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow by IsometricRobot\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/arrow-0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Custom Player/Enemy Sprites and Animations by Michael Alvarez\r\n</p>\n<p>Custom Tileset Assets by Yutong Su\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds and Music:</strong>\r\nBattle Sound Effects by artisticdude\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/battle-sound-effects\r\n</p>\n<p>Rock of War by p0ss\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/rock-war-music-marching-industrial\r\n</p>\n<p>Lose Music #1 and Win Music #1 by remaxim\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lose-music-1\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/win-music-1\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu Music by mrpoly\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/menu-music\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c8717282f06f76e73dce422c59370068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Extremer64"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
