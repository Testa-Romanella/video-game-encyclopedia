Therefor I'm uploading this demo - which has about as much as I originally intended for the project and then some ;) - to see if people are interested in it.<br/><br/>So, please let me know what you think\u00a0 :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41f4ff20c4a366c5e67239d98f0156e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logo is Loading"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
