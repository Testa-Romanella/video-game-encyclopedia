Just create a folder on\u00a0 \\SynthBeat_Data\\StreamingAssets\\Music and add any .mp3 files you want.<br/></p>\n<p>First loading probably will take a while, specially depending on how many musics you have there.<br/><br/>Menu music is by my friend Lennon Barbosa, gameplay music by Aries Beats. I intend to create also a folder for local musicians to have their own levels as well. Feel free to send me your songs and I will upload in a later build!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34cca182e15fbc102a5bae039a221a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gui Santos"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
