In this game-prototype consisting of 16 levels, the player must face the task of filling various sudoku-grids in such a way to restore balance between the elements. No two same elements can be present in the same row nor column and each box represents the combination of its present elements\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Example : mud = water + earth</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Terry Cavanach game jam (September 2021), is my first game jam entry and was inspired by the mobile game \"elemental sudoku\" by vostu which was a personal favorite of mine in my youth. Sadly enough it got removed from the app store, so I decided to recreate it in a few days. Since it is my first project, many things are missing, but since it was made in just 3 days I don't feel bad about it. Maybe a more polished version will be coming out one day ? (the code was designed in such a way so it could support very large grids and thousands of elements)<br/></p>\n\n<p>This was a lot of fun to make, so I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>(All code / art by me)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2ed6a7858144d9a568461014eb04b207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VicoPTP"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
