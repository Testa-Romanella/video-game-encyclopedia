You&#39;ll begin with a regular ship and work your way up by collecting blue points and using them to upgrade your vessel. The vessel&#39;s speed will increase by each beaten level. In the background of each level, you&#39;ll hear a different pumped-up electronic track.<br />\nIn Beat Rush, your goal is to survive throughout the music track playing in the background.<br />\nYou&#39;ll play with spaceships, which can be upgraded.<br />\nBut it&#39;s not going to be that easy!<br />\nThere will be obstacles spawning in your way. Colliding with them will cause damage to your ship. Too much damage and ... boooom.<br />\nYou will also encounter what we call &#39;points&#39;. They are shining conical objects.<br />\nThey come in 3 colors, according to their function in the game.<br />\nAll points replenish some of your health.<br />\nThe blue ones are used as a currency in Beat Rush. You can spend them in the Shop.<br />\nThe pink ones allow you to jump; 15 pink points = 1 jump.<br />\nThe orange ones allow you to regenerate your shield, which you&#39;ll unlock with the 3rd ship in the Shop.<br />\nEach level will be more difficult than the previous one - more obstacles and higher speed.<br />\nColliding with the walls on your sides also damages you - be careful while moving towards them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-10T11:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de5a3cebd92e80927881155aec2b4af.jpg", "website": "https://smdtech.sk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["SMD Technologies", "SMD Tech"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SMD Technologies", "SMD Tech"], "esrb_rating": null}
