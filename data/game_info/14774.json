There is an old underground base, abandoned long time ago, suddenly taken over by some kind of private military and emitting a strange signal. Your mission is to get in, find your way up through fifteen levels in one of three game modes and destroy the source of that signal. There is a lot of hidden data scattered across the base. Try to find as much data as you can to find out who they are and what they are up to.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T02:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27a/27a1a228dfc9a1ad8238f28d1010874b.jpg", "website": "http://www.twitter.com/filuto4000", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 21, "toplay": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michal Kruba"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michal Kruba"], "esrb_rating": null}
