But you can replenish that shot by possessing blue objects!</p>\n<p>Collide with geometry to launch yourself and continue to orbit around the black hole! Each time you jump out of geometry your score increases, the more geometry you collide with before you get sucked into the black hole the higher your score!\r\n</p>\n<p>Blue Stable Geometry\u00a0you can jump off of!\r\n</p>\n<p>Red Unstable Geometry\u00a0launches you immediately in a random direction!
