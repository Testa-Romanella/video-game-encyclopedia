Blow them directly up by sending puffs of air from right below them, or move them left and right by blowing air past one side! When they land they will turn into lovely dandelions. You start with 5 seeds and you can add more any time by pressing X.\u00a0</p>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>I've worked on no fewer than 4 projects this month, I think. But I'm really happy I got this one done in the end - it was a bit last minute as many months go, but it feels so pure and nice to play with the dandelion seeds and get your little garden _just so_. I also decided quite late on that it would be a #nogameovers game - what would be the point of a game over? At first it was going to be that the first dandelion seed landing would freeze the game, play the growth animation and then take you to a game over screen, but this version is way more fun.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.\r\n</p>\n<p>#1GAM May 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e71/e71127d80dba224d3f0c78c182b21b6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
