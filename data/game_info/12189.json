Just cleared a forest of roving bandits? Well they were the only ones keeping a population of meerkats in check. The local farms can't keep them at bay and you've just triggered the worst national food shortage in the past decade. Good job, hero! I think it's time for some payback.<br/><br/>You Are Not The Hero is a 2D Action Platform RPG that ditches the battle system to focus on richer RPG gameplay elements. Instead of playing a traditional hero that saves the world, you're playing a bystander swept into the affairs of heroes and villains alike.<br/><br/>You play as Petula, an unemployed, emotionally charged, ill-tempered, otherwise average young woman. With the royal army hot on their heels, the heroes have made their way to your village where they begin scavenging for supplies in everyone's homes. After you confront them for stealing your pendant, they rush off to continue their quest, giving you a quest of your own to retrieve it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdd/cddf80e2be9c888b829cf54c8f9baa9e.jpg", "website": "http://www.youarenotthehero.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToMorning Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ToMorning Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
