Reason being is that most of art assets, including tileset, are being created by me instead of purchasing ready-made assets. What that means is that development is much, much, slower.</p>\n<p>This is a sci-fi game where the year is set in 9599 and background is our Solar system. The plot is actually a part of my own novel and is a small part of a much bigger world. I have strong lore and stories to back up the game\u2019s world and its settings.</p>\n<p>The protagonists are Kain and Suu whose background and briefs are polar opposites but end up on the same path together eventually.<br/>You, as a player, will play both of them from time to time but not both at the same time.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Kain is a poor part-time journalist who is about to lose his job due to severe economic recession on Moon.
