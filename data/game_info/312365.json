This week's design had to incorporate physics into its gameplay. Isometris is about filling up the box in the centre with as many blocks as possible before they spill over the top -- stack efficiently!</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Game-A-Week is an intensive project module in which students will create about ten prototype games over the semester, (almost) one per week. The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p>\n<p>Week #3: 16.04.2019 - 23.04.2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Repository</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/nomi_proto_3\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------</p>\n<p>Supervised by\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai\u00a0as part of the Game-A-Week project course in the summer semester of 2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:44:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/2706e41ce5f09d71c016c6d565012b2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naomi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
