Abney lives in a hut at the base of a tree. Teal sleeps in the branches of the tree, with her only possessions a blanket and an umbrella. Abney &amp; Teal share their environment with several friends:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Neep</strong>, a small turnip-like creature who digs underground. He\u2019s pretty mischievous and loves porridge.\r\n</li><li><strong>Bop</strong>, an aquatic mammal somewhat resembling a male\u00a0elephant seal\u00a0who drinks water from the lake and blows bubbles.\r\n</li><li><strong>The Poc-Pocs</strong>, a set of 7 identical-shaped but different-sized comma-shaped wooden objects or hard tropical tree seeds, so named after the noise they make jumping about. Their first appearance was in the first episode, \"The Porridge Party\".\r\n</li><li><strong>Toby Dog</strong>, a\u00a0melodeon-playing dog who always sits upright on the same place on the lake's mainland shore. He normally plays the same tune with his accordion, which the narrator describes as several sorts of music. There are rare occasions where Toby Dog will play a variation of his tune, notably the lullaby on the episode\u00a0<em>Bop's Babies</em>.This is also similar to the tune that is played at the end of the episode (presumably by him)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>From time to time Neep's 'friends and relations' come to visit. They look much like Neep but are different colours and sizes and have varying other features. For example, Zeep has a long white and yellow moustache and Boop wears red glasses.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hope you like this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adbc0bfc1c5a123dbb9306653fbf6ac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Bobbertier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
