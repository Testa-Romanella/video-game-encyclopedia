And no stinking zombie apocalypse is going to change that. Take control of your car to see how far you can get and how many zombies you can kill \u2013 and if you can actually escape with your brains intact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>5 cars are available to get you to the final fort, each capable of holding progressively more loot. Ranging from the simple Redneck pick-up and the classy Hunter and to the tough Sledge and frankly-silly Harvester, you\u2019ll enjoy throwing these bodged-up jalopies at the lines of the undead. Each is highly customisable, with 15 upgrades including spiked bumpers, improved tyres, buffed engines, and more ammo, fuel and nitros. With 8 locations to traverse, handsome 3D graphics and gory shambling bodies, Zombie Derby is a killer game. How far can you get before they get YOU?Key features<ul><li>5 killer cars to drive<br/></li><li>5 levels to explore<br/></li><li>3 extreme levels (exclusively for Steam)<br/></li><li>Massively customisable vehicles<br/></li><li>Full HD gameplay and playable at 60fps.</li></ul>SoundtrackSoundtrack by professional guitarist Gennady Rakov, featuring a total of 2 tracks from Zombie Derby in MP3 format!
