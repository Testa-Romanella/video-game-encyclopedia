As a learning exercise I decided to port a fairly simple game I had enjoyed playing recently, with a view to taking the lessons learnt and creating a more ambitious game in the future that might be good enough to be published by AtariAge.</p>\n<p>This initial version is NTSC only, I will work on making a PAL-compatible version in the coming days. I'll also replace the music (a demo tune from\u00a0TIATracker) with a version of the original game's tune\u00a0once I've got the hang of that.</p>\n<p>The code, such as it is, is available on Github:\u00a0https://github.com/1888games/top</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Fire </strong>- Begin game</li><li><strong>Up - </strong>Makes TOP (blue) jump and TOM (orange) return to ground. <em>Hold to jump higher</em>.</li><li><strong>Down</strong><strong>\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>Makes TOP slam\u00a0to ground quickly and bump TOM downwards</li></ul>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<ul><li>The aim is to help both bots avoid the obstacles for as long as possible.</li><li>TOP can only avoid them by jumping.\u00a0</li><li>TOM can only avoid them by being bumped downwards by TOP.\u00a0</li><li>The height of your <strong>jump</strong> is determined by how long UP is held.\u00a0</li><li>Choose the right time to <strong>slam</strong> TOP down to bump TOM under the obstacles.</li></ul>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nScoring\r\n<p>10 points are regularly awarded as the bots move forward without hitting obstacles.</p>\n<p>Bonus points between <strong>100 </strong>and <strong>2500</strong> are awarded for each set of obstacles cleared, based on how difficult they are to traverse.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\nTip\u00a0\r\n<p>There is more leeway to the collision detection on the way up than the way down, so on high obstacles leave your jump as late as possible.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n\r\nTools &amp; Resources\r\n<ul><li>The fantastic online IDE/emulator/debugger at\u00a0https://8bitworkshop.com </li><li>PlayerPal 2600 (sprite editor)</li><li>Atari Background Builder (title screen, not implement yet...)</li><li>TIATracker</li><li>Racing The Beam (Ian Bogost &amp; Nick Montfort)</li><li>Making Games For The Atari 2600 (Steven Hugg)</li><li>https://github.com/realdmx/retrore</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/></em></p>\n\r\nOriginal Game\r\n<p>https://chsxf.itch.io/top-and-tom<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T15:53:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d86ebd4bd1489313fa9684203dceb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
