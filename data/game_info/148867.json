They are encouraged to play over an existing bedtrack through goofy alien voice over. The experience is not just about playing an instrument - the layout of the synth and drum pads require the player to dance in rhythm to the melody they wish to play. </p>\n<p>GAMES FOR HEALTH (and FUN)</p>\n<p>Nu Nu Nautilus began as a school project. Team members Patrick Bender and Nehemiah Westmoreland wanted to blend their enthusiasm for music with the research they were doing on VR applications for Parkinson\u2019s rehabilitation. This research group is composed of IMGD\u2019s very own Creative Media and Behavioral Health Center (Marientina Gotsis), USC Keck School of Medicine (Beth Fisher), and USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy (James Finley). While the research group created many different prototypes for therapeutic intervention, Nu Nu Nautilus was born of a particular sit, reach, and stand task. The layout of the instrument pads mirror different reach tasks and facilitate similar kinds of therapeutic movements (such as free dance or choreographed dance). </p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Get to know some groovy space-faring aliens</p>\n<p>Use HTC Vive + Two Controllers to play synth and drums (and dance while doing it!)</p>\n<p>Witness the spirit of the crowd and the unfolding of the stadium as your jam gets groovier and groovier </p>\n<p>Change synth and drums on the fly </p>\n<p>Make music without the need for mastery - just dance to the melody your sick moves create </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd87511cca5aa5dd058985bfde0fca88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1upwest"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
