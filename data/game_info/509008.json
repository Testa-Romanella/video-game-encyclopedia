DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT GIVING A PROPER FEEDBACK!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>God Does Not Play Dice </strong>is a simple golf-like game, where you play as \u201cGOD\u201d. You have just created a universe and you are bored. So to pass time, you are playing a game with your friend Lucy.</p>\n<p>Although it is a simple game, it plays with the idea of a different planet in a different universe, the existence of a multiverse, and our very own existence.</p>\n<p>Stick until the end and you will understand what I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n<p>There are 5 ranked levels, access the ranking in the link below. https://globalstats.io/leaderboard/5f8e0f045f5e88cc018b484a</p>\n<p><strong>Soundtrack</strong>: Khun, Les Saintes Glaces</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/ZUHN/les_saintes_glaces</p>\n<p><strong>My lessons learned:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The game will not be perfect (in fact there is a high possibility it will be a complete piece of shit)</li><li>Completing a game is rewarding. There is a feel of accomplishment (even though no one may like it)</li><li>All ideas seem fun in your own head</li><li>Invest more time in level design than in trying to make\u00a0it look pretty</li><li>Don't sleep in geometry classes</li><li>Game jams really are great for\u00a0learning</li><li>Sometimes your teammates\u00a0will be unable to help, enjoy that to learn more and gain more XP</li><li>Can't wait to join the next one</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c06744ed0c5cfa76634161f69b7de901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["overmei"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
