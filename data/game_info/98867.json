But I have no love for the President or the peacekeepers. What can I do to help?\"<br/>- Arry, the engineer</p><p>This is Juno's Odyssey, a chain game from the Charas Project community. After unwillingly being transported across the galaxy by an ancient artifact called the Gate, Juno finds herself stranded on a fringe planet. Get a ship, gather a crew and explore the galaxy with our heroine. But most of all solve the mystery of the ancient gates before they end up in the wrong hands.<br/></p><p><strong>What is a chain game?<br/></strong>Remember when you were a kid and played that game when you would fold a piece of paper, draw the start of a creature, and then fold it again and your friend would draw the next part? Then you'd do it back and forth a couple of time when finally you unfold it and look at your creation.<br/>A chain game is basically that: one person starts making a part of the game and when they feel it's reached a good point they sends it off to the next developer on the list. The end result might not always be the most polished game out there but it's an interesting journey where each part of the game bears the unique mark of it's developer.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Chapter 1: Fisherson<br/>Chapter 2: Prpl_Mage<br/>Chapter 3: Moosetroop11<br/>Chapter 4: Drenrin2120<br/>Chapter 5: DragonBlaze<br/>Chapter 6: Momeka<br/>Chapter 7: Fisherson<br/>Chapter 8: Fisherson<br/></p><p><strong>[Join the fun]</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a47d212bce6b2babc7c281c5df0dee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charas Project"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
