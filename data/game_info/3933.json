It is the sixth main installment in the series.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The game takes place six months after the events of Conviction. The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Splinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.</p>\n<p>The players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher&#39;s outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.</p>\n<p>The game evaluates the players&#39; performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2013-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/de9/de93cd3e51d2c57e33bbf7dade34f25a.jpg", "website": "http://www.splintercell.com", "rating": 4.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 159, "owned": 1722, "beaten": 572, "toplay": 81, "dropped": 130, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 553, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 556, "platforms": ["PC", "Wii U", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Toronto"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
