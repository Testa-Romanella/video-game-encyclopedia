You play as a mightful paladin whose goal is to kill all these heretics (it is also my first public game).<br/></p>\n<p>I'll try to update it frequently (maybe once a week if you're a good boi/gurl) and\u00a0I have some ideas to improve the game and to add super cool content in the future.</p>\n<p>The game will be released on PC and Android. (In order to release it on iOs/Osx, I need to have a Mac and I actually don't have one). Also, there is two ways of installing the game on PC : a classic installer and a .zip file. If the installer doesn't work, try the zip cause i've noticed some issues.</p>\r\nFuture Super Cool Content (F.S.C.C.)\r\n<p><strong>Random stuff :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Add music (normally in a few days)</li><li>Pause Menu</li><li>Player death sound effect</li><li>Background (Clouds, town, castle...). Environment will change randomly</li><li>Some crappy backstory</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Ennemies :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Cute redhead witch (flying ennemy)</li><li>Scientists who wants to prove that earth is a ball</li><li>Boss : Social Justice Warrior : well he does what his hame suggests but heretic anyway</li><li>Women who wants rights</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Some kind of laser beam in order to shoot witches (the right-click animation on PC)</li><li>Boss fights</li></ul>\n\r\nContact :\r\n<p>If you want to contact me, here's my\u00a0twitter account or you can send me a mail at gabrielthegamedev@gmail.com .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02a/02a9d7603b1f0a9cc8abdb10e732db34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Gabriel Salach"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
