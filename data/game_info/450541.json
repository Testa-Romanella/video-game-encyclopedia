{"id": 450541, "slug": "the-bull-cow-game", "name": "The Bull-Cow Game", "name_original": "The Bull-Cow Game", "description": "The Bull-Cow Game\r\n<p><strong>The goal of this game is to guess a random isogram.</strong></p>\n<p>An <strong>isogram </strong>is a word with no repeating letters, like: bad, yes, monkey,\u00a0children, or\u00a0ambidextrous.</p>\n<p>You begin the game by entering a word length (3-14) for the game to randomly select a word, and then you have a certain number of guesses to determine the word by repeatedly guessing different isograms. If you can guess the word before you uses all your\u00a0guesses, you win!</p>\n<p>When you make an incorrect guess, you get two pieces of information:\u00a0the number of bulls and the number of cows.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0<strong>bull\u00a0</strong>is a correct letter that is in the isogram in the exact place you wrote it.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0<strong>cow\u00a0</strong>is a correct letter that is in the isogram in a different place than where you wrote it.</p>\n<p>You do not know which of the letters in your guess are the bulls or cows; that's your job to figure out with your deductive reasoning!</p>\n<p>This is a fairly difficult word game, especially depending on the word length you choose, that for me honestly plays more like a math game. It's a tough logic and deductive reasoning puzzle. I've spent hours with this simple game. I think it's quite fun; I hope you do too.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>This was made in C++ in an hour or two\u00a0for fun a few years ago.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb4bb01da6ff90a7734acfc8c6bb87af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
