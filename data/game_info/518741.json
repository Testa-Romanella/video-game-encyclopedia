It is a pool game where the player had to push or pull stuff into the void.\u00a0I had a bigger idea for it, but I could only finish the first basic level. I don't know if I should flesh it out or leave it behind. Seems that there is not much to explore with this idea, other than more mutations and silly levels and multiplayer. I had the idea of the big holes shrinking and I kept one of them in just to show where I was heading with this idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope You enjoy this short game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:02:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97dd4c650a4e2704df35aa141df62b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Antomaat"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
