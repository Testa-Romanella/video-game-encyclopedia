{"id": 101963, "slug": "composition-in-a-minor-key", "name": "Composition in a Minor Key", "name_original": "Composition in a Minor Key", "description": "<p>\"Composition in a Minor Key\" is a surreal interactive story about love, community, loneliness, etc. It boasts roughly 8000 words, and does not contain puzzles, action, or difficult moral choices. There is a small park to explore, seven characters to become acquainted with, and some original illustrations to look at. The player is free to experience the story in any order he or she chooses. The \"ending\" becomes unlocked, simply enough, after the player has taken a certain number of turns.</p><p>This not-quite-game was made for Ruin Jam 2014. It was written, assembled, and illustrated byAleks Samoylov.
