You have to climb against friends through giant candy\r\ncourses in a race for your survival. Conquer your fear of heights and climb the\r\nfastest to have your chance on the winner\u2019s podiums. The quicker you are to\r\nmaster leaps from huge cupcakes, massive lollipops, and gooey candy bars, the\r\nbetter rank you\u2019ll have on the global scoreboards. Every time you win a race,\r\nyou\u2019ll get to choose the fate of your opponents: push the party button and\r\neveryone celebrates the chance to race again, or choose to dip them into a hot\r\ncauldron of melted chocolate. The choice is yours in this sweetly competitive\r\nland of candy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2aff21900a7ef9679e13e7bf9f2ad04d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["realitysmash"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
