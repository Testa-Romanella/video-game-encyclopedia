Have you ever thought about improving your basic adding skills and make your brain just a little bit faster when it comes to similar problems? The Plus Point offers the player precisely that plus a lot of fun while you do it.<br/><br/>The point of this game is to combine the given numbers in each state to create the sum requested by that stage. So, for example, if the stage asks you to make the sum of 14, you can do that by combining 7, 6 and 1 or maybe 12 and 2 - depends on the generated number plates. To make it more interesting and to add a sense to it all, there is a timer forcing you to think quicker and quicker.<br/><br/>Every time you get the right sum, you go onto the next stage with bonus time! This comes in handy later when you get bigger numbers and more complicated sums, so it is something to develop a strategy on. The more time you accumulate, the better your chances of getting the new best score are.<br/><br/>The only dangerous thing in this game is actually getting a sum larger than the requested one - this means game over! Also, there is a possibility of pressing the unfortunate choice of plates so that the ones left do not cut it. That also means adios. All in all, be careful but quick and get your adding face on!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/8173eb74439dd5187c6ed85f688c628b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EasyVisual"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EasyVisual"], "esrb_rating": null}
