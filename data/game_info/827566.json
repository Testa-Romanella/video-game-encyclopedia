However, without coordination and teamwork, earth is as good as gone.</p>\n<p><strong>SUPER COMBINED ARMZ SKIRMISH PARTICIPANTS\u00a0</strong>is an up-to-four-player co-op survival game, where four plucky woodland creatures must work together to operate a tank and survive a robotic onslaught!</p>\n\r\nA\u00a0BRIEF RUNDOWN:\r\nThe game is best played with four players!\r\n<p>The game is played in split screen, with one screen showing the interior of the tank and the other showing the world outside. Using the controls inside the tank you must coordinate who is operating the left and right treads, who is aiming, and who is loading ammo into the gun if you wish to survive! However, there is a catch. Certain large enemies can only be killed with a bullet shot by a player of the corresponding colour, so you'll always have to be switching up your roles! Adaptability, teamwork, and communication are key. If you can survive for five minutes, you win!</p>\n<p><strong>Controllers are strongly\u00a0recommended! However, one player can play on a keyboard.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T11:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/124/124d3f935619174f781085ae7e59f83a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NZSol", "Nemesia", "sleeeeeenky", "Arrowskee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
