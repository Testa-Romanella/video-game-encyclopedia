Up to jump. Avoid the asteroids.</p><p>You play as an astronaut caught outside their ship, leaving them to dodge the space debris.</p><p>We made this game as quickly as possible. We commenced work on the project on the 14th April, and unfortunately had to write off a few days while I was in hospital for an operation, so all-in-all we put about 20 hours of work into the project. We're pretty happy with how it turned out, given the rush, and hopefully people enjoy playing. Thanks for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef9380e44461d3f2ae29052e01ab3946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["teamhyperbeam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
