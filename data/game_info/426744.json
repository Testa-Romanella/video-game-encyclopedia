This short game lets you explore why. In the house, most doors are locked. To find answers, you must find a key to open a door. Behind that door is another key and (most of the time) another piece to the puzzle.</p>\n<p>This game has been created as a dissertation piece for Anglia Ruskin University, exploring how the story in a video game can immerse the player. When you have finished the game please take time to complete the questionnaire (it's literally only 8 questions) - a link to which can be found in the informational text document. The game &amp; questionnaire shouldn't take more than 15 minutes :)</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>Sam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/895d2654c7ba781c43e4bbffa2e23330.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Reynolds"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
