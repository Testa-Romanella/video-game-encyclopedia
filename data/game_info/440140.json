Without those blessings, there is no oxygen, no water, no living organisms, and no fire. The only \u201cliving\u201d thing is a man-made android named Jammo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In this 3D-platformer game, the player acts as the android seeking to help the Earth regain its powers by collecting the elemental particles necessary for the lifeforms to come back.\u00a0\u201cFAWE\u201d is structured in five levels with four levels each representing an element such as water, air, fire, or earth. The fifth level combines the previous four together. To revive the Earth, the player must travel through the levels, avoid obstacles, and receive multiple blessings from the totems that correspond with the elements.
