Your weapon, the quarterstaff, might be a simple weapon but it can become mighty useful if you can wield it right. Here are some protips about that:</p>\n<p>_ Grab it with your left hand to turn the quarterstaff into a two-handed weapon. Wielding it with both your hands allow more versatility, more damage output and most importantly, more coolness factor.</p>\n<p>_ You can throw the staff. It doesn't mean you should, but hey. Call it back using trigger button on your Vive controller.</p>\n<p>_ Try to deflect incoming rocks using your quarterstaff. Sometimes, deflected rock might go right back to the thrower!</p>\n<p>More weapons and updates coming soon!</p>\n<p>Developed by AVR Creative<br/></p>\n<p>Visit us at http://www.avr-creative.com</p>\n<p>Email: contact@avr-creative.com</p>\n<p>Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/AVRCreative</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90bc984b33352ca9767dc6485a1bc2e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AVR Creative"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
