This time I submitted a puzzle game that uses \"swapping of time\" as its main element.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAll images hand-drawn, all code handwritten, all sounds (except backgroundmusic) mouth-made(!) over the course of approximately 24 hours in total.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you play it: thanks! If you let me know your thoughts that would be awesome of you!!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tSome notes:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>There are about 10 levels increasing in difficulty.</li>\n<li>Game is playable with 'WASD'+'F', arrow keys+space, or gamepad+A/B.</li>\n<li>You can <strong>swap </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>speed </strong>with that of a <strong>moving object</strong> with <strong>space/'F' </strong>(the T-SWAP gun is basically the Portal Gun of this game - if still unclear; see the animated .gif below)</li>\n<li>You can change the volume down with 'O' and up with 'P'.</li>\n<li>You can change screen zoom with numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.</li>\n<li>If you encounter a bug and get stuck you can press 'R' to restart the level.</li>\n<li>There's a smashing finale!</li>\n<li>You can also check out my earlier GBJAM5 submission to wind down.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHappy Time Swapping!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t2016-10-06: Added a small UI on the top that displays current level and current speed. Also added a new level right at the start to allow players to more easily understand what they have to do in level 2 (the first actual puzzle room.)\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>2016-10-10: For all people that played this game and/or gave feedback, thank you very much! I will definetly be working on rebooting this game outside of the GBJAM context!</p><p>2016-10-12: Bugfixes with help of /u/PixelatedPope [Youtube]</p><p>2017-02-23: Was thinking about rebooting this game, but due to other project ideas it might be easier to just expand the puzzles in this one, so question for you guys... (let me know in a comment / message)</p><p>Anyone interested in seeing levels with more mechanics? Or simply just more levels?<br/></p><p>2017-03-14: (Pi-Day) added 10 more levels for ONLY 10 cents!
