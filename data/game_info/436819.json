They find themselves in a future dystopia, a world that has been destroyed by no one person in particular, but the collective nation as a whole. The people living in this world are hateful and spiteful at what those that came before them have left for them. Unknowingly, this is the same attitude that brought the world to that state in the first place. The world itself is still functional, with a government and police system, though they are inactive in the current plights of the everyday person. Because of this, people live in anger and resentment, going day by day with no ambitions and no motivation to even continue living. Hidden alone in this world are those who see the possibility for a brighter future. Unfortunately for them, these thoughts are beaten down until there is nothing left, and the person is converted to the disgusting mentality that the others have prescribed to. Our protagonist can see these flickers of light and decides to help reach them and amplify their power. Both in an attempt to fix this world they find them self in, and in the hope that they will find an exit back to their own time.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/188a4ee6903fea8ea946aefe3f202617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["susheelreddy87"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
