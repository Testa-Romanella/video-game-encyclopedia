If you actually like this game, or you feel pity for me, <strong>please donate before/after downloading</strong>. I'm usually quite the poor sap and even my mom isn't making that much money with her current job and stuff. By giving me <strong>a few</strong> dollars, you're helping me <em>and</em> my family get some money to buy more food, drinks, clothes...and of course, a few games and stuff. Oh, and you're also possibly helping me be able to make more games like this. I'm just asking you to be nice, okay? And if you don't want to, that's fine.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________</p>\n<p>This is a game I made for the 2015 Indie Game Making Contest. Like, on the day before it would stop accepting submissions. It was a game made on a rush. Mostly unnoticed by all, judged by one person, and having the possibly awful/decent total score of 7, it is now ready for you to play and download through not just Game Jolt, but itch.io as well, without the need of going to Dropbox!</p>\n<p><em>Description copy-pasted from entry page:</em></p>\n<p>A game made in a rush. It's not that good, in my opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>A young girl was trying to make a game for a contest before the deadline. Suddenly, a succubus appeared! She wanted the girl to get her house and panties back from slimes. She accepted the quest. And now, they must both try to survive a terribly designed maze and beat up slimes to get the panties back!</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Normal RPG gameplay!</li><li>Two amazing characters!</li><li>Slimes!</li><li>A terrible maze!</li><li>Slimes!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Made in:</strong>\u00a0RPG Maker VX Ace</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong>\u00a0A Windows computer that isn't old.
