The king loved his people and his people loved him back.\u00a0 But, behind the scenes, he was dealing in dark rituals with the Gods, secretly sacrificing his own people to appease them, and in return, grow stronger in power with each year. But, after a while, the Gods wanted more. Human sacrifices were not enough, but the souls of animals and children were needed. So the King obeyed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>Still, the Gods grew restless, and one day, unleashed the Shadow Minions among the Kings people. Everyone was slaughtered. Their souls eaten by the Gods.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Many years later, the temple still haunts with magic, and is cursed.\u00a0 So you must venture into the temple, and hope to reverse the slaughter of the Gods.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>But beware. The Gods have cursed this place. Magic is teeming all around you...\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bc/3bce24ccecf50e9aa4c10979ae405f6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Skyshii"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
