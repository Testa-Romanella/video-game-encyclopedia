Playing solo or with friends, you face the simple yet difficult challenge of surviving. At your disposal you have an array of exciting weaponry, from the humble but effective shotgun all the way up to the devastating plasma cannon and the blazing-hot flamethrower. You'll also gain access to powerful gadgets such as the force field generator, the defensive turret and a ton of grenades and mines. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tKilling a single bug is easy. You might even be able to taken down a hundred of them. But to withstand thousands upon thousands you need to understand their strengths and weaknesses, adapt your equipment and weaponry to hit them in their weak spots and co-operate with your squad to maintain an effective perimeter - if they're still alive.</p> Purchasing<p>When you purchase Dropship Down here on itch.io you can click the <strong>Request Key</strong> button on your purchase page.
