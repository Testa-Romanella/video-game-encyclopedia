To clarify:\u00a0this is a basic prototype for testing purposes, gameplay is far from final.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Details:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>An action platformer with some rogue-like elements and cooldown abilities. Takes place on a sci-fi planet connected by ancient portals. Not sure about the rest, but it will likely be about an hour worth of gameplay if I do it right. There\u2019s gonna be a range of enemies and a boss fight, maybe some simple NPC dialogue to sprinkle in some lore.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I plan on improving the building on the current gameplay elements and fleshing out the world. I\u00a0have a lot of plans for quality of life improvements and some features that will make it a lot more fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please provide constructive feedback!
