It is made with Unreal Engine 4 and Photoshop for the tilesets/characters/art.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Zipped is about 200mb, unzipped about 1gb.</p>\n<p>Story<br/>1) It is the near future. There is a base on the Moon<br/>2) There was a very important scientist studying information to get the human race to other planets.<br/>3) The main AI brain went crazy, then corrupted all the robots on the moon, the AI got rid of everyone inside the base.<br/>4) Nobody on Earth knew what happened, the connection from the Moon base to Earth was lost when the main AI brain went nuts. NASA sent a squad of four Astronauts to investigate.<br/>5) You have to recover the data. It was uploaded by the scientist to an old robot before dying. You have to find it and then you have to return to Earth.</p>\n\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>Travel through the level to discover new events, it is a 2D linear platformer cinematic experience.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Sound Effects / Songs<br/>Richard Strauss<br/>Apollo 13 \u2013 NASA (From Astronaut Jack Swigert).<br/>Got them all from FreeSounds.com<br/>BrainClaim<br/>C3Sabertooth<br/>CityRocker<br/>Daney7g<br/>Deathscyp<br/>DokZau<br/>DudeAwesome<br/>DWOBoyle<br/>EdgeofOctober<br/>Frolickingdp1<br/>Harpoyume<br/>InspectorJ<br/>Iwiploppenisse<br/>JohnnyRaySounds<br/>JorgenJak<br/>JustInvoke<br/>Kickhat<br/>LimitSnap_Creations<br/>Onderwish<br/>Parabolix<br/>Primeval_Polypod<br/>Qubodup<br/>Rcroller<br/>Reznik_Krkovicka<br/>RobinHood76<br/>Scale75<br/>Schoggimousse<br/>Sunfly<br/>Timbre<br/>UsuarioLeal<br/>Vumseplutten1709<br/>Wetstahl<br/>X3nus</p>\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for playing!
