Reaction checks and mindgames are the core components in this concept.</p>\n<p>Unfortunatly, time ran out and we had to scrap half of our levels. Additionally, there is no sound.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d15ee9fb7a165b8a1a2e24793ad60a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["web189"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
