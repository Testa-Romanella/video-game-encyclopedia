Your mom is going to kick you out at 30, so choose carefully!<br/><br/>Each time you choose a new llama to become a love interest a year of your life passes by. To improve your score, and find the right llama for you, hard choices will have to be made. Whenever you decided to replace a current love interest with another you are dumping them into the discard pile. HOWEVER, they might comeback if you call them! Perhaps they even improved themselves!<br/><br/>This card game sums your points each turn. This is calculated with the current type of llamas that you have in your hand and their psycological traits. You have to pair up llamas of the same type (background color) and with the same traits. Charismatic (red token), Mature (orange token) and Smart (purple token). By discarding cards you are adding your chances of them coming back better (Golden) which give you more points.<br/><br/>In the end only one llama will stay with you. (In the future we want it to be a choice)<br/><br/>Have fun and beat the highest score!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:08:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901328ce3a8b57a3c2cce07cd3a365fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diogo Portela"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
