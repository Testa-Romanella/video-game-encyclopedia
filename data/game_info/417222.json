Lovecraft's stories.<br/>Though, it could be classified under cosmic horror, if you look at it in a certain way. Just not 'lovecraftian'\u00a0;)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You're a low-ranking cultist in the Cult of Beholder, and yet you've just been summoned by Beholder himself. What could he want from someone like you? Prepare to find out as you follow an asshole deity\u00a0in a night filled with CHILLS, THRILLS, and GENERAL SHITPOSTERY UNDER THE GUISE OF A VISUAL NOVEL.</p>\n<p>The game has <strong>5 endings</strong>.
