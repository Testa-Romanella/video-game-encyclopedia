The player takes control of a spaceship outfitted with lasers, blasting their way through small waves of fodder before facing bosses outfitted with unique weapons and mechanics. The key to mastering The Expanse is patience and pinpoint precision \u2013 the levels are relentless, and leave little room for error. Dodge lasers and destroy your enemies to prove your worth in The Expanse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab168c1f2655b617f8aff9a9cc96024d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
