To save the kingdom, Zar\u2019ralle, a powerful sorcerer, fought against the Darkness. However, its power was too great. Though Zar\u2019alle was able to seal it away at the cost of his life, the world was split in two by a mystical veil. As time went on, the magic disappeared from the new world, Earth, and Braegarthe became a fairytale. <br/></p>\n<p>Marina, a rising softball MVP for Quakersville High School, grew up hearing such stories from her grandmother, but seldom believed them. What 16-year-old believes in magic these days? At least, that\u2019s what she thought until she learned that fairytales are not all fiction. <br/></p>\n<p>The former royal wizard and zealous magical researcher Mirajor, in his quest for knowledge, unknowingly releases an ancient and powerful dark force. Driven mad by the dark influence, he conjures a dark miasma upon the kingdom Braegarthe. As the land becomes corrupted, the veil separating the two worlds is tearing. As a result, dark magic seeps into Marina\u2019s world, slowly draining the planet\u2019s life essence. <br/></p>\n<p>Marina is summoned by The Will of the Worlds to Braegarthe as its Champion to face the Darkness. She must master her new abilities and explore ancient dungeons throughout Braegarthe for the Relics of Zar\u2019ralle to restore the veil and banish the Darkness before it\u2019s too late for both worlds. <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys to move<br/>C/Shift to Dash<br/>W/Space to Jump &amp; Double Jump<br/>X to Attack</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Coding Team</strong><br/>Kassandra Dominguez - <em>Project Manager, Producer</em><br/>Walton Ma - <em>Game Designer, Artist Liaison</em><br/>Eric Nguyen - <em>Assistant Game Designer,\u00a0 Assistant Programmer</em><br/>Johnny Nguyen -<em> Lead Programmer</em></p>\n<p><strong>Art Team<br/></strong>Andrew Allison - <em>Writer</em><br/>Miles Caraker - <em>SFX Artist</em><br/>Angel Flores - <em>Animator, Character Designer</em><br/>Nathan Le - <em>Lead Artist, Background Artist, Level Asset Artist</em><br/>Nick Li - <em>Background Artist, Character Designer, Level Asset Artist</em><br/>Erik Sanchez - <em>Animator, Character Designer</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Free Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Heart asset -\u00a0https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-icon-pack-rpg<br/>Coin asset -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/free-2d-mega-pack-177430#content<br/>Keyboard asset -\u00a0https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T14:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b30c4471eacd95fed264be1fbf1caa5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EricNguyens"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
