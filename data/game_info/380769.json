The big boss finally gives her a job relating to the organization she\u2019s after, but this is something that no one knows, as a matter of fact, she has never been close with any other agents for this very reason.</p>\n<p>Her mission?</p>\n<p>Rescuing her sister, a copy of her sister at least - an AI.</p>\n<p>As planned by the higherups,\u00a0She accordingly enlists herself for that organization\u2019s experimentations that require specific human subjects. There are four other spies enlisting for this public research testing and only two are chosen. Her and a mid-ranking spy that has a similar hair color to her.</p>\n<p>When they arrive at the testing location, she and many other look-alikes (how strange\u2026) are led to an elevator going many floors down. She counted about 40.</p>\n<p>Each of the test subjects is led to individual rooms. The one she entered was unhumanly clean with a heavy clinic scent. She hated it. In the center was a reclining chair with a bright lamp directly shining down on it, like it was some holy alter, untainted by a mortal touch.</p>\n<p>So she abruptly sat down on it without further instruction. The white-coated man inside the room stopped his initial statement and told her to buckle herself in and that this experimentation would be simple and end shortly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Yeah, it definitely wouldn\u2019t) She thought as the shadow of the virtual helmet overtook engulfed the vision and all she could see was the dark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then her brown eyes lit up as a magenta color, rings of circles within her pupils processing the code that made up the virtual space displayed in front of her eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let the\u00a0infiltration begin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0---</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD to move and Mouse click to shoot</p>\n<p>[Game\u00a0Pad on the way!]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T10:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f09209de33bb4a66d8d525cc457878e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["pumibless"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
