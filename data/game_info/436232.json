A cute little hero in this game. He is\r\ntrapped inside a maze of mines, full of diamonds, and 4 deadly\r\nspiders. Your quest is to simply help Fred pick up all of the mines\r\nin 16 different mazes and survive. You will only have 3 lives to\r\nstart with, but luckily there is help at hand. At the start of each\r\nlevel, or a loss of a life, you will be given temporary protection\r\nfrom the spiders. Each spider moves only in a straight direction from\r\none web to another. Then it will decide which way it will move next\r\nin a random fashion. </p>\n<p>Sadly you\r\nwon't be able to escape the mines, due to the entrances being\r\ncompletely sealed up. However, if you pick up all of the diamonds.\r\nYou will automatically leave one mine and move over to another. You\r\nwill be faced yet more spiders and probably some additional good or\r\nnasty surprises. If you complete the 16th mine. You will\r\nbe set free.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Programming by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Exomizer decrunch source by\u00a0<strong>Magnus Lind<br/></strong>Graphics and design by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Music and sound effects by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Tape loader system by\u00a0<strong>Martin Piper<br/><br/>(C)2018-2020 The New Dimension</strong></p><p><em>This game is compatible with PAL and NTSC machines</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57c1fad6672d11772be944d0351b50c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
