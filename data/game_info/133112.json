A controller is recommended, though there are keyboard controls too. Works with Xinput, such as an Xbox360 controller, or a DS4 with DS4Windows</p>\n<p>The doppelganger build below also includes character switching and doppelganger features. It lets you simultaneously play as a character from my other game prototype. These two are not meant to be in the same game, much less controlled at the same time, so controls are awkward. These mechanics are also horribly unbalanced and absolutely not canon, but it's fun, so please try it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/260d3bd932e9daaf239f92d66a06f07a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunar Garde"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
