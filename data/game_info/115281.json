{"id": 115281, "slug": "rogue-cadet", "name": "Rogue Cadet", "name_original": "Rogue Cadet", "description": "<p>\r\n\tRogue Cadet is a 2D SHMUP/Roguelite game where you try to survive in a procedural bullet hell.\u00a0\r\n\tHelped only by your hamster-powered ships.<br/>\r\n\tIn a nutshell:\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fight in a monster-clustered dungeon</li>\n<li>Make money</li>\n<li>Die</li>\n<li>Craft a more awesome ship</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\r\n\tOh, and big explosions, don't forget about big explosions.</p>\n\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The keyboard controls are based on AZERTY by default. You can rebind them  easily in the settings (from the main menu or the pause menu).</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPlaying with a gamepad is recommended. The controls defaults to an Xbox 360 mapping. But then again, you can rebind them in the settings menu. <br/></p><p>The menus are only navigable with the keyboard or the gamepad, there's no mouse support (yet).<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ol><li>\n<strong>SHMUP</strong>: Dodge bullets with precision, explode countless\r\n enemies, feel like the most powerful human being ever. The advantages \r\nof a SHMUP are countless.</li><li><strong>Roguelite</strong>: Nothing gets you the \"one more time\" feeling like a fast paced roguelite (except maybe slot machines).</li><li><strong>Progression</strong>: Who doesn't want to be more powerful? Having an overpowered ship thanks to the death of countless cadets, that's priceless.</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong>:\r\n You'll have to choose among multiple ships, and equip them with various\r\n upgrades and weapons. But here's the catch: you can only carry so much \r\nweight, so you'll have to make choices.</li><li><strong>(Bonus) Colorblind mode</strong>: Not perfect, but if you're a deuteranope or a protanope, you should be able to experience the game as intended.  </li></ol>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n<p> Attention citizens! Your mighty and benevolent leaders just discovered <br/>an ancient Alien sanctuary. As you know, our leaders are always eager to<br/> improve our safety through better armament. And this the perfect <br/>occasion, as at the core of this sanctuary, lies an incommensurable <br/>source of power! But we need you! Exploring the ruins is no easy task, <br/>and only those compatible with our glorious hamster-powered ships have a<br/> chance of success. As such all, individuals aged 14 to 60 must present <br/>themselves to a compatibility test center for immediate assessment. <br/>Those lucky enough will be selected and sent to the sanctuary. There, <br/>those \"cadets\" will have the incredible opportunity to glorify <br/>themselves, their family, and the entire nation! So onwards! Time to <br/>kill some monsters! What amazing days we live in!</p>\n\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Game engine: Unity 5</li>\n<li>Musics: \"Cyborg Ninja\" and \"Level Up\", both by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>\r\n\thttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li>\n<li>Sounds: Made by me, with bfxr</li>\n<li>Graphics (player ships): Mark Hatcher</li><li>Graphics (logo &amp; room tileset): Markus Just</li><li>Graphics (enemy ships, bullets, explosion): \"Spaceship Shooter Environment\" by ansimuz</li>\n<li>Everything else: Maxime Lo Re</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tAnother thing.
