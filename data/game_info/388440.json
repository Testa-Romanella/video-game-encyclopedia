Energy is generated constantly by your solar panels, and are consumed by building each structure. Barracks will spawn Rovers that automatically seek out and attack the enemy base.</p>\n<p>Rover was built in Godot and all of the assets were created in AssetForge.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d521b307b5a307addc01caf01ede1ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aidan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
