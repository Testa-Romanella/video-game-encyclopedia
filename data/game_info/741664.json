It is rich with side content and dungeons that contain puzzles and bosses. It has many classic RPG mechanics such as hidden bosses, unique equipment and skills, rewarding exploration of side content, and is equally as rich with story, lore, and worldbuilding. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is the first game in the LoA franchise, a fantasy world filled with backstory that combines positive aspects of both realistic fantasy and high fantasy to generate a world filled with political intrigue, culture, the impact of fantasy elements in realistic societies, and many small details that give the world life. This world is a vehicle for meaningful stories following themes not often discussed in fantasy such as toxicity or modern existential problems, and will utilize ludonarrative(writing told through game mechanics) elements to enhance every part of the experience. Most importantly, this world is something you can be a part of, so join us for our first foray into it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nABS Plugin by KageDesu(all needed credits in game end credits)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLegacy of Aeroja is a non-commercial product.
