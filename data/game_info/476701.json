Navigation in the 1,000 uncharted sectors is difficult and you'll need all your abilities to complete your important mission.</p>\n<p>You need to explore the sector of space as you go along, using the strength of the stricken starship's distress signal as a guide. You have limited fuel capacity, and you should try to avoid asteroids, through which careful navigation saps extra fuel, and hyperspaces, large wormholes which throw you out of your way. Planets, on the other hand, are a source of fuel.</p>\n<p>Early in your career, you'll be sent on the easier missions in which location and approach to the shipwreck can be straightforward. As you progress, though, your missions will become more and more challenging. Once you have succeeded in the final mission, you will be awarded a well-deserved retirement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256d667902663efd95b515372981bd3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damian Gareth Walker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
