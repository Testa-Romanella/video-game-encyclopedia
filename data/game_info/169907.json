If you think it was not as good as harden 3 it is because harden 3 had a dev schedule of \u22486 months while this game hade a dev schedule of 9-10 days so don't expect the best! With that said i hope you will enjoy it! :)</p><p>The full version contains online multiplayer compared to the lite version.</p><p>Multiplayer:</p><p>If you want to play multiplayer peer to peer you do like this(if you play lan) one player creates a server by pressing d in the meny then entering the number 2 and pressing enter then the other player connects to the server by pressing d att the meny and then enter the number 1 then they enter the servers IPV4 address and then entering the port 5604. You will have to portforward the port 5604 if you wish to play between networks.</p><p>We do not have official servers if you would like to host them please contact me att mingamesstudios@gmail.com. For now you will have to use the peer to peer multiplayer witch is the easiest to setup.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad4f9e095b67397f86e5b9a1a3288dee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mincoder"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
