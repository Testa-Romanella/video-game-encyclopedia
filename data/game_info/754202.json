You have to\u00a0 use your power to flip \u00a0gravity to \u00a0avoid obstacles and get to the doors in time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Story:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Escape \u00a0through the various test rooms of the Institute, a misterious lab that you find yourself in after waking up from a coma and with a new found superpower - gravity manipulation.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Invertia has a simple but aesthetically consistant aesthetic while also combining simple but effective mechanics. The Prototype comes with three difficulties:</p>\n<p>Easy: No timer,\u00a0 no stress. Just go at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Normal: For the casual gamer. \u00a0Balanced challenges this time with a timer.</p>\n<p>Hell: For the hardcore ones among you. Narrower passages and a \u00a0tigher run time will make you sweat.<br/></p>\n<p>Your deaths are counted in the top left of the screen and marked in the level with pointers so you can see where you struggle. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This is a basic prototype done by a small team\u00a0 for a project week. It is by no means bug-free or highly polished.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Project Manager: https://dethyser.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Game Design Leader: https://itch.io/profile/felix-nuernberg<br/></p>\n<p>Programming Leader: https://itch.io/profile/naroxo<br/></p>\n<p>Art Director: \u00a0https://decaffed.itch.io/<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a52caa6e156d5ca432c8d5af961d24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NaroXo", "DeCaffed", "felix Nuernberg", "Dethyser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
