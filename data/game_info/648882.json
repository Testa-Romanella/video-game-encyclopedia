But beware, not all of them are real or the person's. Arrest those people and only allow in people with the correct spelling of passport and the right name. If you get the same person twice (apart from when changing levels) it can often stop working so just refresh. Same if in the very rare instance it goes blank.\u00a0</p><p>Made in godot.</p>\n<p>BTS:</p>\n<p>The person script was a headache because the longest script I had ever done (110 lines) span across 2 months (because it was systems I slowly was adding in). (BTW all the people are the same instance!) This time I wrote almost 170 lines in 2 hours working time and 4 hours worth of breaks all to:</p>\n<p>1. make a random name</p>\n<p>2. say if it is real or not</p>\n<p>3. if not the reason</p>\n<p>4. set what it should display</p>\n<p>5. set the sprites</p>\n<p>and 6. construct an array with those bits of data.</p>\n<p>That is not even counting the other scripts. All made in 2 days. (day 1 code and day 2 art and itch page)</p>\n<p>If you are a programmer and you think 170 lines is nothing, remember I am just a kid not even teenager, a kid.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T09:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e66af5901ba68dc71839431d175f5a8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bogeyman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
