Research your subjects, choose your questions carefully, and probe for the truth, however dreadful it may be.<br />\nMonitor interviewees\u2019 emotions in real time - joy, sadness, anger, disgust, shock, and fear. Use this data to your advantage, intimidating, cajoling, or even befriending your subjects in order to to uncover more information.<br />\nChoose a side in the midst of a brewing conflict: lie to your superiors and spare deviant androids, or condemn them to secure your own survival within the corporation. There are no easy answers. Silicon Dreams has multiple endings depending on the choices you make. Each android could live or die by your words.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T19:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be206d87435232c53438ad3cd0bcdfad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 34, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 14}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["James Patton", "Clockwork bird"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clockwork Bird"], "esrb_rating": null}
