Feel free to leave any feedback as it's essential for my project work.</p>\n<p>The main idea of this TD game\u00a0is replayability. But now it isn't actually very replayable, beacause there isn't enough number of random things.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>1. Press play button in the menu.</p>\n<p>2. Hover mouse over tower in the bottom left corner.</p>\n<p>3.Left click on the tower.</p>\n<p>4.Choose a spot to place the tower while still holding left mouse button.</p>\n<p>5.Stop holding left mouse button (if tower is highlighted with red, you can't place tower in this spot, so you need to choose different spot)</p>\n<p>You can also click on towers after they have been placed to upgrade them or see their attack radius</p>\n<p>Tower cost is 15</p>\n<p>Projectile speed upgrade price is equal to projectile speed of the tower</p>\n<p>Shoot cooldown upgrade price is calculated with the following formula:\u00a010 * 1/tower shot cooldown</p>\n<p>Enemy detection area upgrade price\u00a0is calculated with the following formula:\u00a0 tower detection area / 10</p>\n<p>Damage upgrade price is simply tower damage multiplied by 10.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f5a8da3cf62f9bd0c00fc03a25ba7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["LNL Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
