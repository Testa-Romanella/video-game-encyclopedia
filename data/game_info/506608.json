{"id": 506608, "slug": "the-bee-roll", "name": "The Bee Roll", "name_original": "The Bee Roll", "description": "<p>There is an elderly woman who has a garden, it's all she has, but the thing is she is a terrible gardener. A little bee notices this, and wants to help! So as a sort of ritual, every morning the bee wakes up, and tends to the lady's garden. \"The title is a pun on the term B-roll, which refers to the parts in films which seemingly don't matter, (clouds passing, scene shots, etc) but those scenes are what exist between the action you know. So, I like to think we all have our own little worker bee tending to our own garden of life.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Jam Site</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0Orlando Global Game Jam<br/><strong>Jam Year</strong>:\u00a02016<br/><strong>Game Jam Theme:\u00a0</strong>Ritual</p>\n<p><strong>Diversifiers:\u00a0<br/></strong>Gandhi's Game<br/>One hand tied behind my back<br/>Story Mode<br/>LEGO got it right</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms:\u00a0<br/></strong>Android</p>\n<p><strong>Tools And Technologies:\u00a0<br/></strong>Unity (any product), Virtual reality head mount display (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0<br/></strong>Patricio\u00a0Delgado - Creative Lead, 3D Artist, Queen Bee<br/>Brian Foster - Programmer, Surfer, Glitch Hater, Bee's Knees<br/>Chris Ibach - 3D Artist, Pastel Color Organizer, Worker Drone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:39:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/264359e21cad42e3b9e31c4d6cc3c2e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["brianisbrilliant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
