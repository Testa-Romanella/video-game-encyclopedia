Current project: figure out what R&amp;D stands for and if you can drink it.<br/></li><li><strong>Motor Church</strong><br/>Followers of the holy Devidsan are crazy in love with their water scooters, or maybe they are simply crazy, anyway, these are the guys that go scavenging and bring in the fuel and junk for all our construction needs.<br/></li><li><strong>A.C.D.C. (Anarcho Communistic Democratic Community)</strong><br/>A bunch of politically correct weirdos. Unpredictable and aggressive: a natural choice for our law enforcement service!</li></ul><br/>All these guys hate each other with all their rotten hearts and unless you manage to preserve a balance of power between them you are pretty much done for!<br/><br/><br/>Collect resources and expand Junk City\u2019s infrastructure in order to collect more resources and expand even further. There is nothing quite like some mindless consumption, ain\u2019t there?<br/><br/><br/>Those moonshiner dudes aren\u2019t drinking all that booze for anything. It gives them ideas for new crazy inventions, uses their mad skills to upgrade your buildings.<br/><br/><br/>Every once in a while the city will require a wise decision to be made by its mayor. Watch out as every choice will have consequences.<br/><br/><br/>Not all of the beautiful things that we have in Junk City are made there, some of those things we need to find elsewhere and sometimes it takes a bit of rough persuasion. Send out \u201cexploratory\u201d expeditions and watch as they bring home tons of neat loot.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T02:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f3828fff9abc4babfe9bb2a746906ddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Art Games Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
