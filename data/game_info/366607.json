I went for hyper-realistic audio, which was quite the undertaking. There are improvements to be made in several areas, but this is what I could do in the span of a week. Decisions are time sensitive! You currently can only restart after dying, but I may update that before the jam is over. This game is not hard by any means, but you can effectively choose who lives and dies in the game. I hope you enjoy~</p>\n<p>Credit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Me,\u00a0Soniss Sounds, Free Sounds</p>\n<p>Voice Acting: My Friends, Me</p>\n<p>Everything Else: Me</p><p>Update: Done a little over an hour before the jam ends, fixes a couple problems, and allows you to go back when you die, instead of restarting the whole game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:09:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc4ecb35353fb3c4e27676ceffeb7308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steamy Wet Hat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
