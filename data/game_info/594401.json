She\u2019s been quite rambunctious and gotten herself into some wacky scenarios in the past, and in this branching narrative, you can step into the world in her paws! In this story, you\u2019ll em*bark* as Olive, hopping the backyard fence and taking to the streets to explore what the local area has to offer. Based on the decisions you make, you\u2019ll receive one of three tailored endings based on the moods Olive can most often be found in.</p>\n<p>All of these scenarios are fictitious but based on how Olive handles her day-to-day life as a wild but precious pup.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:10:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/1790d8d3785ce0b4310448d7d6da1a43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kenn_exe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
