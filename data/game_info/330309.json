This was an interactive environment I created for a class at uni. The theme was 'Journey'. Have a good explore and look around, there's a couple hidden details to be found! Some stuff you can click\u00a0on to interact. WASD and mouse to move around, right click to zoom the camera in.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this project was pretty rushed toward the end of the semester, so the environment isn't as polished as I would like it to be - I wanted it absolutely jam packed with detail. Unfortunately,\u00a0 it wasn't meant to be! But I'm still pretty happy with the environment as it is :) I don't have any plans currently to come back to it at this time.\u00a0Hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Asset List:</p>\n<p>\u2018Low Hum\u2019 sound by\r\nfreesound user unfa, used in temple area of level for ambience.\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/154902/</p>\n<p>\u2018wind in tree white\r\nbirch 01\u2019 by freesound user klankbeeld, used in suburb area of level for\r\nambience.\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/131032/</p>\n<p>I also used assets\r\nfrom the following games that I\u2019ve made myself:</p>\n<ul> <li>Medusa\u2019s Atlantis</li> <li>The Cypher Master\u2019s Puzzle     Box</li> <li>Melbourne Architecture Viewer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T06:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f272f9f2ecb121c262b8e8a32cf071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
