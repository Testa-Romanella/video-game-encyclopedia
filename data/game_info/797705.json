Start your tour in Tartarus (which is under construction due to multiple OSHA violations), then move on to the wonderfully drab and unexciting Asphodel Fields (where hydroponics towers were recently installed to more efficiently grow asphodel trees), and finish your journey in the idyllic beachside caves of Elysium (now staffed with maybe too many\u00a0 lifeguards after a little incident last year--seriously, who would have guessed that Heracles couldn't swim?)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to budget restrictions, we haven't been able to arrange an actual transportation system between these scenic Underworld regions, so you'll have to do it the old fashioned way: dying painfully! Now, the more pleasant the location, the harder it may be to find a way to \"move on\", but you look smart; I'm sure you'll figure it out!</p>\n<p>My first game, made in ten days\u00a0for the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy this short little platformer!</p>\n<p>Design and programming done by Dr_Hydration</p>\n<p>Art, animations, and music made by Bepis_Man</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T22:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/459d7976f84ca61004e589940bba5a88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dr_Hydration"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
