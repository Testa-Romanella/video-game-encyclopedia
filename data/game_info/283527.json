It's cold and the Fireflies won't last long out in the open, to keep them from dying, make sure you move them under the lights of the multiple lanterns in the level. Lastly, Fireflies will be different colors, White FireFlies are happy under any Lantern, but the other Fireflies must be under a Lantern that shares their color. <br/><br/>Made by Tommy, Anish and Donny<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/52775e04f96bfde0dabb066d3a770d13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donald Clark"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
