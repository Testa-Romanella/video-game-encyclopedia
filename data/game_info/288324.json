YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Original Blurb</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>The world spins as you come to. As your eyes adjust to the darkness of your environment, you find your hat. Donning your trusty headpiece, you realize that there's only one explanation...Smoke, the Magician of Mirrors, must have thrown you into his basement! The twisted fellow loves to watch mages like yourself stumble through his maze-like basement. To make matters worse, the basement is littered with illusions of Smoke, known and Mirrors, which will blast anything which does not wear a top hat! Can you make it out in one piece?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>WASD</em>: Move</li><li><em>Numpad 1/2/3</em>: Use spells 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</li><li><em>Numpad +</em>: Start preparing a spell.</li><li><em>Numpad Enter</em>: Finish answer.</li><li><em>Numpad Del</em> (usually the dot): Erase previous digit.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Postmortem Notes<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>This is one of my first projects. Haha, I remember throwing together the levels within a few days of the contest.
