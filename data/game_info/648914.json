I will try my best to fix the issues, and I will let you know when the new release comes out. I will also release the source code if someone wants that. Before the new version, I would not recommend to download this version because of the game breaking bugs. Thanks for testing the game and for all the feedback! :)</p>\n<p>**<br/></p>\n<p>Collect as many clouds as fast as possible!
