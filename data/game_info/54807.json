It was one of the first snowboarding games for Windows to take full advantage of 3D graphics cards that were becoming the norm in the late 1990s, and eventually became an internationally bestselling game. Over 1.5 million units were sold worldwide, allowing Supreme Snowboarding to become the first hit title in Finnish game development. The game received positive critical reception, as well as acclaim for having one of the best visuals of its time, though its lack of content and replay value was sometimes criticized.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61e0a1d358586dc86f14fe4a1802fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Housemarque"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Infogrames", "Infogrames Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
