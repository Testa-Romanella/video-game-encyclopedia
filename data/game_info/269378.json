With your small boat you should be able to make it out alive... although you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you aren&#39;t alone.<br />\nThey That Feast is a horror focused game where you are being stalked by things that defy human explanation. Avoidance is your best asset. While you will discover an artifact that gives you some ability to see your pursuers, it comes at the cost of draining your sanity when you use it. Therefore you must weigh your need to see your enemies while maintaining your mental health.<br />\nInvestigate isolated villages, and try to make sense of the horrors that have befallen them.<br />\nYour boat is your biggest safety net, don&#39;t lose sight of it!<br />\nBe prepared to run at any moment, the feast has already begun.<br />\nTrack down your colleague Lorenzo, he may not have much time.<br />\nWatch your boat&#39;s gas tank closely, and keep an eye out for refill canisters.<br />\nThe Old Ones are lurking everywhere, don&#39;t let them corner you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83c/83c7a298f2917a9c537a5bd079d05fe3.jpg", "website": "https://www.tumblr.com/blog/blackwoodspecter", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blackwood Specter"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blackwood Specter"], "esrb_rating": null}
