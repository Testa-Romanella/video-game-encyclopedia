If you don't like to read, you may feel bad.<br/>\r\nI don't follow some players' advice. aBANdon02 is more crazy, darker, more confusing than conNEcT01.<br/>\r\nIt tells that when a android named AI marryed with human, she woke up and rebuilt humans. The story is in another dimension, so don't think it's in the 3rd dimension.<br/>\r\nI follow some players' advice. aBANdon02 is a very simple game. And it even has no gameplay. When you are in the scene that you will die, you can skip it if you died 10 times.<br/>\r\nI found that in conNEcT01, almost nobody can collect all secret items and achieve secret ending. For showing the truth to everyone, the ending will ignore secret items.
