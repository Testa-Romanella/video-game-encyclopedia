In the game one of the most important weapon is the ground bomb (the only one that can damage ground enemies). It has exactly <strong>10 seconds cooldown</strong> (so use it wisely).</p>\n<p>It is a war between \"<em>J</em><em>unk Food</em>\" (represented by the hamburger player ship and \"<em>Healthy Food</em>\" (the enemies - fruits and vegetables). The enemies are both flying ones and grounded; they can both attack the player but the players as indicated previously can use only the ground bomb (a\u00a0fizzy candy) to damage ground enemies and the bullets (rotating fries) for the flying ones. The player has 6 lives and will lose one while being hit by an enemy bullet (represented by green cabbage) or direct collision with flying enemies (the grounded ones do not generate collision).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard <strong>aswd </strong>or <strong>up/down/left/right</strong> buttons to move. <strong>Space bar</strong> or <strong>left mouse</strong> button for flying bullets, <strong>Alt button</strong> or <strong>right mouse</strong> for ground bomb.</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Team:\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0kamaleon70\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0KingdomPots\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Design &amp; Composition:\u00a0James Foss\u00a0 (jamesfossaudio.com\u00a0|\u00a0linktr.ee)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Fonts: Google Fonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2c4701c959a38b07b89a4b446910da4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["KingdomPots", "kamaleon70", "James Foss"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
