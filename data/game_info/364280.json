Simply swipe, or click, drag and release, the wooden bowling ball and do your best to aim at the pins. Tap or click the ball to pick it up again when it returns to you. Each pin scores one point. The center pin, which is bigger than the others, is called \"the King\" and gives you nine points. You must hit at least one pin to continue the game to another round (four rounds in total). If you miss, the game is over. In addition, you must avoid getting a higher score than 36 in total. If you get more, you lose all your points and the game is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T05:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4cebc3a4070221d37af6d3f09694cf53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tidvis"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
