If you move into a room that doesn't exist yet, you have to build it.  Spend cards from your hand that include all the gems on the door you're building.  (Most cards have 2 gems, and can be spent as either or both!)  Choose the rotation of the new room and add it to the mine.<br/><br/><strong>Collecting Gems</strong><br/>For your action, use a room's special ability to draw more gem cards.  Different rooms have different rules for drawing cards, so choosing the right room for your situation is key!  (If you can't find a useful room, you can always draw a single card instead.)<br/><br/>At the start of your next turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you'll have to discard down to 4.<br/><br/><strong>Winning</strong><br/>In Rush Mode, the players race against each other.
