You are put in an empty room, with a set of speakers that play a set of sounds, and you must identify the source location of the requested sound. The game also experiments with stencil buffer geometry cutting: the base room itself is entirely made up of a single cube, and the holes in the floor are stencil buffer magic: if you're observant you'll notice the holes are never in the same place.</p><p>Headphones recommended!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e600ef7ad2d41fcf902dc06967f8a187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vostn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
