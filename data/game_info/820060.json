I have to mention that <strong>I have been in charge of creating all the assets of the game</strong> using free tools such as Paint 3D and soundtrap, except for the <strong>fonts used in the game sprites</strong>. This title is, like the vast majority of my projects, open source, so it is also published on GitHub. I hope you enjoy it and if so, please <strong>leave a positive review and share it</strong>, it would help me a lot. Also, I have a small YouTube channel in Spanish that you can watch if you've been wanting more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T22:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/487c32e7add9f41451ba6e089a2eb69e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Henry D\u00edaz Bord\u00f3n"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
