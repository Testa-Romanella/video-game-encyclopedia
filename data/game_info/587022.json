This job is not always easy,\u00a0\u00a0but you have been chosen for a reason, so don't let the Vikings down. If you do, THEY WILL KILL YOU!</p>\r\nGameplay\u00a0\r\n<p>Deliver orders that come in within the move limit. If you fail, the patience of the Vikings starts to run thin but you can increase it by delivering orders on time. The Vikings want apples, berries,\u00a0eggs, mutton, pork, fish, and LOTS of mead!\u00a0\u00a0You can\u00a0roast, boil, and smoke almost all the available\u00a0ingredients, and the more orders you finish, the more difficult the next ones will be.
