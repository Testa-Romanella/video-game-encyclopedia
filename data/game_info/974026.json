Even if the world is against you. You're the intruder.</strong><br/><br/>Intruder Alert is a 2D action-stealth adventure combined with multiple other genres packed into a single game. You play as a circle. A shape determined to complete its mission. Stealthily avoid other shapes, defeat them when necessary, and complete various tasks along your journey.<h3>UNFORGIVING</h3>Deaths are inevitable. If you get annoyed easily, this game probably isn't for you. Just know that it's a skill issue.<h3>VARYING GAMEPLAY</h3>From stealth to RPG to infinite runner, you'll be shocked to learn what the next level has in store for you as the gameplay suddenly changes. Be prepared.<h3>REPLAYABLE</h3>Play through a wide range of levels, and time yourself for each one. Try to beat your fastest time if you can.<h3>BOSSES</h3>Every difficult game needs a boss or two. Or three. Or four. Or five. Maybe just five. Don't worry, though; you'll have more trouble just getting to them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T08:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231b88dd8d01376d36ab7d709c0915fd.jpg", "website": "https://www.stylishesper.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stylish Esper"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stylish Esper"], "esrb_rating": null}
