The Orbit is protected by a guardian who only lives to break your score. Will you allow the guardian to do his job?<br/><br/>Unlock new items!<br/><br/>Feed the orbit with your score.<br/><br/>NEW: Do you have a friend near and both of you want to challenge the orbit?<br/>The orbit allows you to play together against the guardian in the new Local Multiplayer Mode. Unlock it and play with another player in the same device.<br/>maybe the guardian is not so amused having to knock out two at the same time in the orbit, but now it is his goal.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot for playing and good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T10:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a33677d8aa24df78893c33e5cf063d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tonyus93"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
