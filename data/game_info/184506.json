You can build and upgrade towers by circling the tower socket. Each round you can build more towers.</p>\n<p>With three different types of towers, you can build a \"perfect\" strategy to prevent the horde of evil clouds with stupid hats to finish the lap and hurt you and your reputation.</p>\n<p>The ice tower will spin your enemies around, preventing them to be as quick as you are.<br/>The fire tower will shoot an enemy and will let him (or her!) die in agony.<br/>The tower of doom will devour the souls of a group of enemies.</p>\n<p>The main goal is to finish the race before you run out of life(s).
