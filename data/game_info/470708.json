Use the\u00a0<strong><em>bait cam</em></strong>, it makes catching fish a breeze!<br/><br/>- Understand the game uses <strong><em>3D </em></strong>models, however the game is <strong><em>LOCKED ONTO A 2D PLANE</em></strong> ( Think 2.5D, or \"still 2D, but you can swing the camera around ). <strong><em>Understanding this is KEY to getting the hang of the controls</em></strong>, and it's confusing to a lot of people at first.<br/><br/>- As the rounds progress, the fish will become <strong><em>stronger </em></strong>and more aggressive/powerful. It is wise to <strong><em>upgrade </em></strong>your character before moving along the rounds -- it will be harder later<br/><br/>- Fish at later rounds are only found at deeper depths -- upgrade the line to reach them.<br/><br/>- Certain fish only like certain bait. You should purchase the research cam and aim it at the fish to collect data on them to find out what they eat!<br/><br/>- The statues retain collected data retrieved from doing <strong><em>research </em></strong>on <strong><em>FISH</em></strong>! The more research you do, the more <strong><em>SECRET ADVANTAGES</em></strong> you will gain!<br/><br/>- You do not have to have a fish on the line to grab them -- in fact grabbing them in a free dive allows for the ability to stab them into chunks and collect more scales and chum :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:11:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d976e79374233c189d504cf673d7da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuitsnNukes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
