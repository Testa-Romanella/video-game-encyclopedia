It\u2019s been a very long time since my last release on the project and I was concerned that if I didn\u2019t just put something out and get myself moving I\u2019d never be able to pick it up again, so here it is.<br/></p><p>I\u2019m back at work on Movement I: Reverie, but I want to release more of these interludes as a way to take breaks from the full game\u00a0but still be able to express something. I like making these little self contained scenes quite a bit.</p>\n<p>A game by <strong>Fannon Cushing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In Memory of Charlie Schulz</strong></p>\n<p>Musi<strong>c by</strong> <strong>\u7591\u5fc3\u6697\u9b3c</strong> from the album <strong>\u6b7b\u3068\u751f\u306f\u540c\u3058\u3067\u3059 (death and life are the same)</strong></p>\n<p>Released and Provided for use by <strong>Geometric Lullaby</strong></p>\n<p>https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/death-and-life-are-the-same</p>\n<p><strong>Interlude: Andalusia</strong> was created in ~8 hours, including recreating shaders from the original release for UE5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://rabbitrungames.itch.io/thedrowningmachine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/7306515302515bfa686ced94be085a08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit Run Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
