Though you start armed with an over the top\u00a0level of sugar based armaments there's one catch: in order to progress through the various screens, you need to use one of your guns to unlock each door, leaving it behind, and slowly stripping you of your defenses. See if you can handle the task!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Move around with the standard WASD, and aim your shots with your mouse, using left click to shoot!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<p>Liam Healey - Systems Engineer/Designer</p>\n<p>Bobby Perry - Systems Engineer</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sabrina Rice - Enemy Artist/Sound Design + Music</p>\n<p>Taylor Penrod - Character Design/Art</p>\n<p>Donovan Delats - Weapon Sprites/Design</p>\n<p>Benjamin Westlake - 2D Art/Level Elements</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Griffin Girvan-Morris - Producer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T06:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9a16c7002ab92817b4d854fedd0290b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["w2reach"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
