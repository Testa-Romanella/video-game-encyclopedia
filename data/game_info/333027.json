As you complete areas in Chronicle Mode, you'll liberate planets and unlock new areas. Whenever you liberate a world, it will also be unlocked and shared with other players that are in the same cabinet. Compete with other players to see who can clear the most worlds, or see who can get the highest score in each world. It's like a miniature universe that you share with other players!", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2015-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-16T14:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2ac25dec8cd5c1846c1293c4a8bc3cc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 96, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 192, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Pyramid", "DEGICA CO", "Chara-Ani"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Degica", "Chara-Ani"], "esrb_rating": null}
