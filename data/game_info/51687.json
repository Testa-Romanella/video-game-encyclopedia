Just wait until you see the other unusual illnesses afflicting the people of Two Point County. Care for, and profit from, the ill: that seems like it\u2019s probably a win-win.

That cash isn\u2019t going to make itself, now.</p>\n<h2>Manage Your Staff</h2>\n<p>Hire your staff, juggle their demands and cater to their personalities. Train a crack team that can handle every sickly challenge that\u2019s thrown at it, and fire anyone that can\u2019t.</p>\n<h2>Expand Your Organisation</h2>\n<p>Grow the sickness business across the beautiful Two Point County. Research illnesses and develop new inventions to compete with rival healthcare companies.</p>\n<h2>Collaborate and Compete with Friends</h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve conquered the world with your medical empire, contribute to Two Point County\u2019s global medical community with collaborative research projects, or demonstrate your medical prowess in competitive multiplayer challenges.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2b9/2b90a0b4cafe05eefaa2698d6613dc7f.jpg", "website": "https://www.twopointhospital.com", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 128, "owned": 2230, "beaten": 86, "toplay": 107, "dropped": 247, "playing": 85}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 270, "ratings_count": 394, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 395, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One", "macOS"], "developers": ["Two Point Studios", "GAMESDROP"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "GAMESDROP"], "esrb_rating": null}
