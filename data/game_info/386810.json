Release date to be determined, lots of things should change until then - especially in the graphics area. This is an early demo of this game.</p>\n<p><strong>The current level is completed when all the bulbs on screen are switched on</strong>, including the one in your ship.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The twist is that you must always stay connected.</strong> Each level usually starts with an electric generator ; spawn your own \u2018electromagnetic\u2019 relays for they could act as connecting spots, linking the bulbs through the hostile environment. A relay may have different weapon configurations to choose from.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ll have to adapt while crossing the path of enemies evolutive AI, alien artefacts and entities, fauna with different behaviors</strong> ; environment itself has its own mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Eventually, It opens possibilities of intricate puzzles and fine tactical battles ! <br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>This demo comes with a very short survey. It launches on your favorite navigator when exiting the program. Please allow this window and help me enhance this project !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1960e1465fbca17c564804a50b75a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas Delattre"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
