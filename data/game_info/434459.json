Well, this time he will spare your life in exchange for a few others and dang, is he hungry!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Keep an eye on Pennywise to see who he wants to eat. Try to be as fast as possible to find that person and stab him, Pennywise will take care of the rest. Stab the wrong person, Pennywise eats YOU. When Pennywise gets up, expect a timer (which reduces over time) and a defined victim. When he\u2019s down, you can stab freely whomever you want. Also, avoid the cars as well as police bullets!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>[WASD] - move</p>\n<p>[space] / E / LMB - stab</p>\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n<p>Keep IT alive. In this game you play as a man who is blackmailed by an \"unknown clown\", which has been weakened lately due to not being fed properly, to kill others so he doesn't kill YOU. But don't get fooled. He may be weaker than before, but he has enough strength to finish you off! Because people are afraid of death, by killing them you help feed IT with fear and a bit of meat on the side. It will be game over for you if you don't fulfill this gourmet clown's wishes within the given time. Also, watch out for cars, obviously! So do your best to get a high score, no one likes a quick shot.</p>\n\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n<p>April 23, 2020: <strong>Keeping IT Alive v1.1</strong> has been released!
