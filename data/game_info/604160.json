What makes this particular inspiration meaningful to you?\u00a0</strong></em></p><p>When I was around 10 years old, I received my very first birthday gift from my Dad. My family isn\u2019t big on presents, its usually just a dinner and a cake so when my dad handed me a pink DS, you can only imagine my excitement and surprise. From that day on, I was immersed in the world of Mario because it was the only game that I had, and I didn\u2019t have social media or a computer. It was either watching TV or playing my DS and of course, I chose my DS. I loved Mario, I would sometimes pretend I\u2019m Princess Peach, just waiting for someone to come sweep me off my feet. It was a mix of fairytale stories and my wild imagination. Just two weeks ago in the present time, my boyfriend randomly bought me a LEGO 71374 Nintendo Entertainment System Super Mario Lego set which can be seen in my game. It had 2646 pieces and it took me around 6 hours non-stop to complete it. It brought me back to my childhood, that ecstatic feeling of receiving a gift for the very first time and it made me forget about all the stress I was feeling, it made me feel like a kid again.</p><p><em><strong>Your game: How did you turn this inspiration into an interactive virtual world? Be specific about how particular aspects of your game--textures, objects, the map/layout, the skybox, text interaction, animations, sound--tell a story that the player can experience and interact with?</strong></em></p><p>When I first sat down to create my virtual world, it was important to me to create a feeling of nostalgia. When I was first introduced to Mario, I played a lot especially at night, it was my stress reliever after a long day of school. Using that notion, I wanted to create a nighttime sky and encapsulate my entire world into it. Mario usually features the daytime, but I wanted to add a twist into the world we all are used to seeing. To further encapsulate the player into the world, I made a wall of Mario characters from Uno cards. When you\u2019re in that space, you are surrounded by Mario characters, it quite literally is your world and that\u2019s exactly how I used to feel when I played as a child. I also wanted the player to interact with all those characters because they were essentially my \u201cfriends\u201d as a kid, so I placed all of them in the forest each saying their catchphrases. I feel that the catchphrases add to that nostalgic feeling because you associate certain characters with certain sayings and it just hits you, like Mario saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a-me, Mario!\u201d. I don\u2019t even need to include his voice and you can already hear what he sounds like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5a/b5a42e9409bb668e5298b3a893926e24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amy Zhang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
