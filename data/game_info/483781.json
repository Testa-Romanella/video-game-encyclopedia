My focus in this project was learning some scripting in Unity (C#) while using only minimalist graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>My goal this time was to create a short interactive experience. Maybe I'll update and develop this project a bit after the jam.</p>\n<strong>Language</strong>\n<p>For now the game is only available in English.
