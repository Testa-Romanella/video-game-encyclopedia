It's all about how sometimes things end for a good reason and it's not the end, it's the beginning of something new and beautiful. I have had no prior experience making any sort of video games, but I really wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone and create something that was decent enough to be played. Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T10:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8435148a749cce0b685d7bc79542742f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DistortedCube"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
