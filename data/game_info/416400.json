{"id": 416400, "slug": "sync-3d", "name": "Sync 3D", "name_original": "Sync 3D", "description": "<p>Sync is a puzzle game based on moving all robots to the same location. You can press up, down, left, or right to move all robots in the corresponding direction. If any of them fall off the level stage, you fail the level, but if all get to the same tile, the level is completed. You can push robots against walls to stop them from moving in a specific direction and therefore move the robots closer together. There are  110 levels, and each level has both a solution and a \u201cpar,\u201d which is the number of moves in an efficient solution.\u00a0 You can play the levels in (almost) whatever order you like. After you complete the level that introduces a mechanic, you unlock every level until the next mechanic, allowing you to play in whatever order is most fun for you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T03:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/23533a84deae3a29cb1c489f06c43605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
