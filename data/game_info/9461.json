To help Osy you will use osmosis to keep her in balance with the world around her. Add and remove Osy\u2019s bits (solute) to control the flow of water into and out of Osy. Be careful though, add too much water to Osy and she swells up and pops, too little water and she shrivels up.<br/><br/>Osy is the first game to show the key elements of osmosis as you play, namely bound and free water molecules.

Cogent Education was formed by members of this group to design and develop future education simulations and games. All profits from Osy will go towards the creation of other educational games and interactive software.The Science behind Osy Osmosis<br/>People can find understanding osmosis a little tricky \u2013 but this is because all the textbooks do a horrible job of explaining it! Let\u2019s see if we can do a better job\u2026<br/><br/>Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane, like Osy\u2019s cell membrane. When you add a solute, (e.g., table salt) to water, some of the water molecules attach to the solute, so you end up with two kinds of water \u2013 \u201csolute-bound water\u201d and \u201cfree water\u201d. Only the free water can diffuse through the membrane.<br/><br/>Because diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, the concentration of free water determines which direction osmosis occurs. For example, when you add bits (solutes) to Osy, some of the free water molecules attach to the bits, and this reduces the concentration of free water inside Osy \u2013 so, free water diffuses into Osy and she swells up!<br/><br/>When you remove the bits from Osy, the water molecules are released from the bits, so the concentration of free water inside Osy increases \u2013 so free water diffuses out of Osy and she shrinks.<br/><br/>OK, that\u2019s the science-y bit, now go and have some fun with Osy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d59b69454c7883c7d83bd8283f735ba6.jpg", "website": "http://osyosmosis.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cogent Education"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cogent Education"], "esrb_rating": null}
