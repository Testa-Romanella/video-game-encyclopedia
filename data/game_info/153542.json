OR a ball of light that will be trapped in different worlds. In a logic game where you must find a way to get the ball inside to our big light so as to move on to the next world! 15 worlds one more difficult than the other, each world with its increasingly difficult obstacles and adversity, but beware of being a ball of light can be turned off by a variety of dangerous foes. Do not underestimate the apparent simplicity of the OR because it will amaze you. in the game there will be pitfalls of any kind! The 3D graphics allows you to see the light from above. will open up a world of possible combinations, the worlds have to be completed on a logical sequence, you will have to open passages and normal intelligence and use powers to bring our ball into the hole of light! OR looks like a 3D game compelling and smart!<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceI7vT_CuoE<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69a29d8ec134bb82e9c3341b720e792c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Camagames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
