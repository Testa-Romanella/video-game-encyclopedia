You Scored:\";s:fori=0to4000:next:a$=\"\":run</p>\n<p>Game Rules and Instructions<br/>You have been sent to an alien planet<br/>to investigate the rich deposits of \u2018O\u2019,<br/>a vital energy source for the planetary<br/>defence system. The deposits are<br/>deep beneath the surface, trapped<br/>within caves that descend in to the<br/>alien planets core. You must navigate<br/>your shuttle pod using the \u2018z\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019<br/>keys, this will activate the pods side<br/>thrusters and move you from side to<br/>side, but once on the move the shuttle<br/>will continue to move in that direction!<br/>You must avoid hitting the cave walls,<br/>while trying to navigate on to the \u2018O\u2019<br/>deposits. This is harder than it seems<br/>however, as the magnetic properties<br/>of the walls are playing havoc with the<br/>shuttles thrusters! Trying to navigate<br/>on to the vital \u2018O\u2019 deposits is<br/>extremely difficult as you must be<br/>precise in order to get the vital energy.<br/>If you successfully manage to grab the \u2018O\u2019 you will hear a confirmation beep, but you<br/>must stay alert! Successfully grabbing some \u2018O\u2019 will increase your score by 50 points!<br/>So it is well worth pursuing. Hitting the walls will result in instant death! And the game<br/>will start again. Be warned though.. the cave walls get narrower every 100 points and<br/>the amount of \u2018O\u2019 depletes the deeper you go. Try to stay alive for as long as possible<br/>and collect as much \u2018O\u2019 energy as you can on your way down! Carry on commander!<br/>And good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767ef35bca4b5dda2e721448faffe2b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
