Chopping trees, farming crops, mining rocks, and fishing are just a few of the activities you can try your hand at! Use your skills to gather resources, cook food, and craft deadly weapons! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Skilling isn't the only thing you can do, though! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Slay monsters and fearsome bosses with unique mechanics for armor and valuable loot to power up your hero. Upgrade armor and weapons to increase stats even further!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Collect and level up pets to help you on your adventures. Pets can also be sent on missions to gain materials needed to create powerful armor and weapon enchantments to further improve and customize your hero. Can you collect them all?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Want to help other Skillers? Band together with other players by joining or creating a guild. Take down the weekly guild boss and earn rewards for everyone along the way. Compete with other guilds in public guild leaderboards to see which guild is the best of the best!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Want to play a certain way? Level up your hero and choose from a selection of talent trees to fit your play style. Go more idle for easy offline/passive skilling. Or go a bit more active and gain a boost to your online activities. The choice is yours!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skill Quest is filled with lovely retro-styled pixel art. Some art assets were not created by me, however, but all credits to the creators can be found in-game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Key features:<br/>-Gathering Skills: Woodcutting, Fishing, Mining, Farming<br/>-Artisan Skills: Cooking, Smithing, Fletching, Crafting<br/>-Combat Skill: Slayer<br/>-Combat: Slay monsters and fearsome bosses for valuable loot.<br/>-Pets: Collect pets to aid you on your adventures.<br/>-Missions: Send pets on missions to gain magical materials.<br/>-Enchanting: Create mystical enchantments for your gear.<br/>-Talents: Level up your hero to select useful talents.<br/>-Tools: Automate production with tools.<br/>-Prestige: Feeling a big slow?
