You have left your friends behind\u2014and with them, your books and the mysteries you had uncovered. You are a reader, looking for secrets hidden by forgotten sages between the lines of their ancient tomes. Or rather, you were a reader; who knows what you are now, stranded alone in this foreign land. Maybe here, unlike back home, there might be some use for your unusual skill? </em><br/></p>\n<p>The Reader's Encounter is a short story-driven puzzle game about secret knowledge and manipulating words.</p>\n<p>-<br/></p>\n<p>The game has a built-in hint system; hints become active after 5 manipulations on each level. If you are stuck and the hints do not help, see the walkthrough here: https://pastebin.com/VwrEjUBH (caution: major spoilers!).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:04:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62a/62a791f28c5d5d832ab7febbf0fee037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["senokos"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
