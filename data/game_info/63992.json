Granted, some self-defence might be necessary sometimes but we are sure you will prevail. :) We hope you have a great/relaxing/death-defying time with our first creation in Unreal Engine.<br/><br/>Tweet at us if something isn't going right or you have something you want to ask @BBridgesVR @JoyGoodchild", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f6beec0be60419d4f510a5a46931a7.jpg", "website": "https://www.amstaddigital.com/games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C\u00e9cile Amstad", "James Lennon", "Lindsay Orsini", "Himanshu Chaudhary", "Hunter Kyle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amstad Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
