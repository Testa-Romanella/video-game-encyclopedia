Safe at home while society collapsed around him, John had lived a quiet, routine, and peaceful life on his own. But all good things must come to an end: he has recently run low on supplies and must leave his sanctuary to collect more if he is to continue to survive. Join him as he ventures out, braving the post-apocalyptic world around him and unraveling the mysteries of his strange situation for the very first time since the end of days began.</p>\n<p>The Age of Deliverance is a short, exploration and story-based adventure game developed using RPG Maker VX Ace. Typical gameplay from start to finish averages around 2 to 4 hours. Includes custom, hand-drawn, and awesome MS Paint graphics and a full soundtrack of (pretty good) free-for-use music.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This game contains animated violence and touches on themes that some players may find upsetting or controversial.
