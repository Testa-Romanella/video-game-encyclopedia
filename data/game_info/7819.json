{"id": 7819, "slug": "superhot", "name": "SUPERHOT", "name_original": "SUPERHOT", "description": "<p>SUPERHOT is an artistically minimalistic first-person shooter. The key feature of the project is its time mechanics. If you don\u2019t move the action slows down so you can think over your next steps. This feature brings together shooters and strategies, making SUPERHOT a mix of these genres.<br />\nThe story follows the concept of a &quot;game inside a game.&quot; It starts with your friend who sends you a game you definitely need to try. But the further you go, the more you realize there&#39;s somebody except you in the game, who wants you to stop playing. So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what&#39;s happening.\u00a0<br />\nBesides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again. At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies&#39; guns and ammo or use melee combat. Additional to the campaign mode, there&#39;s the endless one and the challenge to make levels more difficult.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2016-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-24T05:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad445a12ee46543d4d117f3893041ebf.jpg", "website": "http://superhotgame.com", "rating": 4.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 242, "owned": 3883, "beaten": 1480, "toplay": 180, "dropped": 347, "playing": 67}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 105, "ratings_count": 1481, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1502, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Xbox One", "Linux", "Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SUPERHOT Team", "SUPERHOT"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SUPERHOT Team", "SUPERHOT"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
