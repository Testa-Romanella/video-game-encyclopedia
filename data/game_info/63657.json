It's also my very first solo project after six years of working on much larger team projects.<br/>After all that work on slow pachyderms, I wanted to take a stab at something smaller, faster to make, and granting a more immediate fun.<br/>So, I dusted a gameplay idea I hid in a drawer a couple of years back, I set it up as a 30 minutes-a-day project and started working on it during lunch breaks. When the prototype was welcomed quite enthusiastically by the first testers, I decided to make it real.<br/><br/><strong>Razerwire:Nanowars\u2122 is as a simple little game, quite replayable and with a little nice set of upgrades, achievements and highscores to beat to satisfy the progression geek in all of us.</strong><br/><br/><strong>It is suggested to play with a mouse, but now since version 1.07, Razerwire integrates full controller support as well</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you get to have half the fun playing it as I had making it, I think you'll cherish it!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Emiliano, @DokHgn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Use the mouse to maneuver a monomolecular filament (the RazerWire) to protect your generators and kill the nanobugs assaulting them.<br/></li><li>Survive endless waves of attackers with increasing difficulty. <br/></li><li>Avoid hits on the Generators.<br/></li><li>Use the RazerWire to destroy your enemies.<br/></li><li>Use left and right mouse click to activate some powerups (like the Antimatter Blaster and the PowerWave).</li></ul><br/>Enjoy a rogue-like progress: Survive as many waves as possible, die, use earned points to unlock upgrades and powerups, and then jump back in the fight (there are checkpoints every 20 waves, no worries!)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Multiple enemy types with several variants each :<br/></li><li>7 Movement types (including Teleport, Accelerating Zig zags and Escaping from the Wire)<br/></li><li>4 Shooting modes including homing missiles, scrambling bullets and all-around shooting<br/></li><li>2 Armor types<br/></li><li>Multiple unlockable upgrades for the Wire including Shields, Armor, Health and Recovery Times<br/></li><li>Up to 7 powerups including Anabolishields, Nanoblades and Chrono Molasses<br/></li><li>Procedural difficulty increase in the endless waves progression<br/></li><li>If you like what you see, feel free to follow me (@DokHgn) and RWNW (@RzW_NW) on Twitter! Support is the best fuel for productivity ;)</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>In a future far, far away, humanity has colonized most of the galaxy. However, our world is being exterminated by an unseen enemy.<br/><br/>When scientists figured out that the killers are nano-sized, virus-like aliens, Dr.Illerotsap modifies a medical tool, a monomolecular filament used for nano-scale medical operations, and turns it into a formidable weapon against the enemy. <br/><br/>The RazeWire was born.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>My thanks go first and foremost to my family and to Jenny, for supporting my mad attempts at making a living with a job that I love.<br/><br/>To Olaf for sharing my office throughout the whole development, drooling over my flip flops and covering the floor with hair and love.<br/><br/>To my friend Ottavio from Mash Machine for having made the super cool music for the game.<br/><br/>To Yannis for all the help with the copies and marketing (I am even worse at that than at art otherwise ;) ).<br/><br/>To Juhani Junkala for his amazing  8-bit VFX libraries https://juhanijunkala.com/<br/><br/>To Siim and Mikk for the moral support throughout the project.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d132a6b251519918f579ca198ca40c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 62, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Screwdriver and Pigeons"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hammer and Ravens"], "esrb_rating": null}
