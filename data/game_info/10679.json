Take control of Nahmi and her fellow outcasts, utilising a brand new deck and dice based combat system to strike a blow to the noble Lords\u2019 and Ladies\u2019 unquenchable thirst for profit.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>Professional thieves on the trail of an ancient relic, the group infiltrates the glittering halls of a corrupt noble\u2019s private chambers in pursuit of their target, narrowly escaping the wrath of the city guards at every turn. Desperate to find an escape, they seek refuge in the city\u2019s seamy slums and brave the sunless pits of the underworld. Out to get them are heavily armed city guards, rival gangs and psychotic families of subterranean cannibals. Abandoned by the system and used by selfish criminals, these young companions will be forced to come to terms with their own reality. But be warned - in the world of Children of Zodiarcs, no one escapes unscathed!<br/><br/>KEY FEATURES:<br/><strong>Combat Cards</strong><br/>Each of your party members\u2019 attacks &amp; abilities are bound to combat cards.

Favoring symbols over numbers, these dice deliver attack, defence, healing, and special ability modifiers.<br/><br/><strong>Influencing Lady Luck</strong><br/>To add yet more layers of stratagem to Children of Zodiarcs, you can craft dice to favour your play style, and re-roll up to two dice every time you throw. You need not fear being at Lady Luck\u2019s mercy!<br/><br/><strong>A World Full of Characters</strong><br/>Along the way you\u2019ll come to learn about Nahmi - stolen from her homeland as a child, Brice - forced to survive on the mean streets of Torus; Zirchhoff - a charismatic bandit leader who employs young orphans to do his bidding: as well as many more mischief makers.<br/><br/><strong>Building Decks</strong><br/>Each playable character comes with their own customisable deck.
