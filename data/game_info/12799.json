In Left-Hand Path you'll gesture to cast spells, squat to avoid an axe larger than your whole body, dodge to let arrows whizz past you, duck to look into secret passages, hook hidden items into view, and more. It's specifically designed for room-scale, and it's room-scale only.<br/></li><li>Left-Hand Path is NOT a short arcade experience. It's a fully-fleshed-out, voice-acted, animated RPG with over 10 hours' play time in Early Access and around 17-20 hours\u2019 total playtime planned. <br/></li><li>Left-Hand Path is NOT easy. To quote my biggest inspiration for the project, Dark Souls, \"Prepare To Die\". But it's also not unfair. Enemies do have weaknesses, and you have the power of magic itself. You'll find your way.</li></ul><br/>We'll see you in the Well of All Reward. <br/><br/>We Who Watch The Well await you...Play Style Details<br/><strong>Locomotion:</strong> Left-Hand Path supports both teleport-style locomotion and sliding-style locomotion. <br/><br/><strong>Left-Handed Support:</strong> Left-handed play is fully supported. <br/><br/><strong>Minimum Spec:</strong> Left-Hand Path should run smoothly on any PC that's VR-ready. <br/><br/><strong>Play Time:</strong> Left-Hand Path is 10+ hours of play time in the current Early Access release. I'll be aggressively adding to that over time.Short Quotes from Steam reviewers<br/>\"It's the first game that I've lost myself in the Chaperone boundaries (ended up running into my couch) since I was so engrossed while attempting a ritual.\" - Naravail<br/><br/>\"A concise summary of Left Hand Path is basically three words: \"Dark Souls VR.\" \" - thepalatinepoet<br/><br/>\"This is a phenominally unique dark fantasy VR game as well as a challenging rpg adventure.\" - OuijaboredComments From Playtesters<br/>\" It's utterly brilliant (and scared the almighty s**t out of me).\" \u2013 Johnnie<br/><br/>\"I plunged into Left-Hand Path.
