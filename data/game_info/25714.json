Bags, or Cornhole as \n      they call it in some parts of the country, originated in the Midwest in \n      the 1960s and has since become a staple at outdoor social events from \n      coast to coast. Bags is a deceptively simple, yet extremely competitive \n      game where players try to toss beanbags into a hole in a slightly raised \n      platform or \"box\" for points, similar to horseshoes. Whether at a \n      tailgate party or a summer barbeque, the game has become a social focal \n      point, and the unmistakable thud of bags hitting the box is now a \n      universal party sound track.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Incredible Technologies"], "esrb_rating": null}
