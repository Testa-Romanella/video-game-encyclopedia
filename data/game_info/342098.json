(literally) You can switch between the three main characters: Bob, a walking fish,\u00a0 Ern, an eagle, and Rick, a stuttering reindeer. They each have unique abilities.<br/></p>\n<p>Throughout your adventure you'll be doing puzzles, platforming, exploring and much more. It'll go from a detective game, to a stealth game, and then into a full-on metroidvania.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>It has local co-op - you can each take on one of the three characters and play the entire adventure with two friends. (Not in the demo!)</p>\n<p>Chapter 1 is available as a free demo now! It's an early version of the game and may contain bugs. There are 5 chapters planned in total, and they'll each switch up the gameplay drastically.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77a95a08ed387f3ed21d06edd6ee3c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SpeedFrame"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
