She was overfilled with emptiness, but still trying to be fit, either not to die.</p>\n<p>She was born in a tough galaxy, full of other angry and ambitious blackholes, which don't have any borders. Besides them all, small ships are flying across the universe. These little buddies are blackholes' food.</p>\n<p>Our Black Hole has one special ability. She knows everything about every living creature, she had eaten. Because of this, she suffers because of conscience and proud of herself at the same time.
