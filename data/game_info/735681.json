For example, the Oval ship will use a teleporter to prevent you from moving it to the correct sorting box. <br/>There are currently 23 levels in the game, including 4 bonus levels. There is also an endless mode. After completing each level, you will be able to unlock various cosmetics, such as ship flight particles.<br/><br/>\u00a0<strong>Game length</strong>: The passage of the game will most likely take you about 2 hours. This time may increase if you often replay the same levels or want to open all cosmetics.<br/><br/>\u00a0<strong>Simple music</strong>, composed by me, so you will not have copyright problems.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Controls:</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mouse - drag and drop ships<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"R\" - restart the level\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Esc\" - return to the main menu\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Delete\" - delete all saves<br/><br/><strong>\u00a0Important Notes: <br/></strong>\u00a0-\u00a0The \"Quit\" button is the only way to save game data. Unfortunately, because im crooked-handed, it will not close the game, so just close the game window after clicking. Once again I apologize for the inconvenience caused.<br/>- <strong>Mac OS and Linux versions have not been tested.</strong> This means that it is possible that they will not even open, or they will have some bugs. You can report bugs, but the best I can do is remove those versions.</p>\n<p>I would be very happy if you write a review after playing the game.
