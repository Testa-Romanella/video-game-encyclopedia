Experience systematic ragdoll systems, thrown and broken objects, which are not obvious to be found in other games.</p>\n<p><strong>\"You make a revenge, I build results.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Police J comes to Kim, a student who was bullied at Lee-Mok High School in San Francisco, USA in 2005. J offers to give pocket money according to the value of the student's arrest if he punishes and arrests the students who bullied Kim. Kim, who was bullied by all students, accepted the offer, and now Lee-Mok High School has only to be avenged.</p>\n<p><strong>The way to realize justice</strong></p>\n<p>All students at Tooner High School are bullying Kim. Punish by throwing weapons or physical objects. Revenge if you make eye contact while walking around the hallway. Punish even if the breathing sound is loud. Even if you're ugly, punish them. Punish both the teachers and the principal. If you take them to J's police van, J will pay an additional corresponding price. You don't have to feel guilty. Everyone is bullying Kim, and you are just realizing justice. If you lost interest in repeated punishment, it's not a bad idea to carry out additional quests provided by J. If enough money has been collected, the ultimate goal is to purchase nuclear weapons parts through Kim's home PC, expel all personnel in the school, and blast and demolish buildings.</p>\n<p><strong>Slave of capital, student leaders</strong></p>\n<p>The counselors (LMCD), as known as student leaders, will punish you when you do something wrong. Openworld games always has this kind of group. However, protection on students is not their jurisdiction. they only work for teachers and themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a school or a subway entrance to hell?</strong></p>\n<p>There are many unique friends in this school. Kim is also a very unique case right now. <strong>Coco Brothers</strong>, who throw up bombs when they're nervous, <strong>Jay and Jenny</strong>, a nuisance couple who always stick together at schools where dating is prohibited. Right, There are also a psychopath dancer rabbit <strong>Bunny</strong> and a 500kg giant <strong>Terence</strong> who destroys everything and everyone on his way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d11af901269cee0c85c8daf724097d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mahn-In Industries"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
