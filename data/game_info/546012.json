It\u00a0explores\u00a0the threshold between the virtual and the physical space. The asynchronicity of movement and method are the components for the created worlds.</p><p>There are three levels of abstraction that can be explored. The first level contains the most recognisable relicts of the real. 3D scanned parts of the physical were transferred into the virtual. The second level explores a more abstract form of reality. Here movement becomes matter,\u00a0 \"stills\" fill the scene as you explore the remnants of motion.\u00a0The last scene sees even your character being dissolved. The virtual self looses it's eligibility to exist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f195381cf2300403efa841a011250ace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["./studio3/VR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
