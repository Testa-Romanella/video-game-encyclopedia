The first moments it feels unreal and then makes one sad, quite sad. It doesn't let one sleep and the memories keep repeating in ones head. I am not good with words but let me give you one thing on your way. Nothing is forever.<br/> \r\nFeel free to share your experiences of grief and loss but only if you feel comfortable. <br/> \r\nFeedback would be nice, too. ;-&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>\r\nAD - Move<br/> W - Wind<br/> Space - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>\r\nProgramming, Design, Music, some Sounds and some Art: Vinzenz Prakoso<br/>\r\nPixel Art:\u00a0https://aamatniekss.itch.io/deep-forest-pixel-tileset<br/>\r\nBackgrounds: https://edermunizz.itch.io/pixel-art-plataformer-painted-style<br/>\r\nSFX: https://beepyeah.itch.io/8-bit-sfx-pack<br/>\r\nFont: https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-gold</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d9d8db14a3c4194ea994c272e79a17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Osoka"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
