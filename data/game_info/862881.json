Every 10 seconds his body changes into a plant and\u00a0then back to a chicken. It makes traveling difficult, but the plant can absorb\u00a0light from the energy stones to activate the Crystal of Curse Curing conveniently\u00a0located in the same cave.</p>\n<p>This game is made for Ludum Dare 51: Every 10 Seconds. I was working on\u00a0another game over the weekend, so I did not get to add much complexity. Game play is probably 30-60 seconds max.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T17:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/772f6f110868a4009f49628161ef1d2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kobato Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
