This is Strat Stat Roller, an original dice game where a good strategy is just as important as a good roll.</p>\n<p>The gameplay loop is simple. Roll dice. Pick which units will get the stats of each dice. then see what your enemy has planned. After that, the results of your stat strats will be revealed.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you have FOUR unit types:</p>\n<ol><li>Knight - deals damage</li><li>Priest - heals and keeps you alive</li><li>Bard - sings for the benefit of the archer, potentially boosting their stats</li><li>Archer - can increase damage done, under the right conditions</li></ol>\n<p>The real brilliance of the game is that while the goal is to defeat your opponent, each unit also has their own battle to fight, which all have an effect the outcome. Bards compete to give a bonus to Archers, who then compete with or without that bonus to aid the Knights in dealing damage. The knights must do more damage than the enemies Priest if you want any hope of beating them.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to play my game, I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>Credit at\u00a0<strong><em>https://patrickdearteaga.com\u00a0</em></strong>for the royalty free music (<em>Child's Nightmare</em>) and to an anonymous friend for the artwork.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T15:34:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b1ebee3e010bad6f522b1b1ea04e002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ike_Gamesmith"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
