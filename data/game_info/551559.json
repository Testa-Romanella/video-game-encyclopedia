Pick up and throw anything you can find at enemies to survive the harsh desert. Each playthrough is unique and creative use of all the weapons at your disposal\u00a0is essential to victory.</p>\n\n<p>The story follows\u00a0Maki, a cursed soul wandering the desert in search of a legendary flower that can cure the curse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inspiration for Maki Beast all started with the music video to Fleet Foxes'\u00a0\"The Shrine / An Argument\"\u00a0and then went in all sorts\u00a0of crazy directions from ideas that filled my head during road trips through the American West, where I live. It's a combination of a whole lot of wacky stuff but I'm really happy with how it turned out and I hope you enjoy it too! If you like the game, please consider supporting through pay-what-you-want.
