The world is ending! Everyone is dead!</p>\n<p>You still gotta go to work though.</p>\n\n<p>Essential Worker: Zombie Pandemic is a suddenly very relevant throwback to the arcade games of old. It may or may not also be trying to make a statement...</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You play as yourself, working at a grocery store during the zombie pandemic. Your job is to throw canned goods at the invading zombie hordes, protecting the few crates left of products. Better protect them well too, because standing my a crate is the only way to refill your creamed corn ammo supply.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>A DISCLAIMER</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for Dream Arcade Archive game jam,and being a jam game, is far from a finished, complete package. It is playable, but due to some unfortunate distraction was made entirely in the last 10 hours before the deadline. I will be updating it and fleshing it out in the following days and weeks, until it is a full game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:59:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0e4a9f130cd55858306706383da170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberDreams Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
