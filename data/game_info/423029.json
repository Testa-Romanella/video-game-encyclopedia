This is only fast implementation of the game but not demo. Game allows to play with friend or with AI. This is my first 3d game so give my feedback if you can. I don't have much time to add for example custom enemies or more animations or fight combinations.</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/stanfortonski/StickMan-3D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:42:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e3483a0dce0fadd1c65f50e6e57c24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stan Fortonski"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
