You can also square your X or Y to make them better.<br/><br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Mouse Controls<br/>F for Fullscreen<br/>Over time you will rack up a currency marked in the top left, called brain cells. When you have enough brain cells, left click the unit you wish to place and it will be placed in it's spawning spot. You cannot spawn another of the same unit if there is one already occupying the spawning spot. Your goal is to simply defend your equals and you will have to move around your units by holding left click and dragging to the spot they are needed in. Any time that an enemy passes the area where the equals are, even if they are destroyed, you will get a -10 brain cell penalty.\u00a0You can have 20 units at a time (not including Squared), but be careful, because if more than one unit occupy one spot all units on that spot will get a huge debuff.\u00a0Lastly, every few minutes, you will receive a warning that\u00a0an enemy storm is incoming. This means that the difficulty will rise and 1 or more new types of enemies will be introduced. You eventually will also receive a warning that a boss is incoming. This means that the final boss will spawn soon.<br/><br/><br/>Unit Descriptions:<br/><br/>X: Acts as a guard that defends all enemy attacks until it's HP is drained. It costs 4 brain cells to spawn.<br/><br/>Y: Acts as a turret that shoots once in a while, but if it is hit even once, it will instantly die.\u00a0It costs 12 brain cells to spawn.<br/><br/>Squared: This unit is unique. It does not take up any unit spaces and instead buffs whatever unit it is on the same spot as. It will lower the shooting time of Y and higher the health of X. It costs 80 brain cells to spawn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T08:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/920ab2b9aaced9bb6fd1ad32d39e9138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Esper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
