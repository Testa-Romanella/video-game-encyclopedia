Gameplay was live-action, using NERF-style foam blasters. Combat was squad based, with each team being limited to 5-10 players during signup. One player on each team was given a Google Cardboard headset to complete Augmented Reality challenges with their team. This player was known as the team's Decker. Team's fought one another while completing missions. This segment of DAEMON was open only to SCAD Students and Alumni.</p>\n<p>The second part of DAEMON was a New Media gallery show, centered around glitch art, curated by the DAEMON team and headlined by local artist JON SPRINGS. This segment of DAEMON was open to anyone. Additional art from assorted glitch artists, as well as the work we did to make DAEMON reality, were featured.<br/><br/>DAEMON was successfully Kickstarted April 13, 2016, for $1,365 with 38 backers.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This page serves to allow newer people unawares of DAEMON or the project to discover it, download the app, play around with the targets, and learn more about the project we worked ourselves to death for. While DAEMON has already come and gone, we hope you enjoy what we have to offer of the remaining experience. As it stands, we're currently editing a documentary of DAEMON for the purposes of sharing the experience with those who didn't get to play it.<br/></p>\n<p>DAEMON was made possible by:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>DAEMON CORE TEAM:<ul><li>Daniel Pomidor</li><li>Jon Springs</li><li>Dima Dubodel</li><li>Zach Turcich</li><li>Kamron Shushtar</li><li>Ty Roberson</li><li>Oran Domingue</li><li>Rey Cuevas</li><li>Andreas Latourette</li></ul></li><li>GAME AND PRODUCTION STAFF:\r\n<ul><li>Hayden Rice</li><li>Ria Urbon</li><li>Benjamin Pomidor</li><li>Dylan Gray</li><li>Ragon Dickard</li><li>Katie Friedman</li><li>Robyn Whaples<br/></li><li>Nick Castillo</li><li>Jason Rigsbee</li><li>Sari Gilbert</li><li>Garrett Nesselrode</li><li>Nicholas Lawrence</li><li>Jon Thomson</li><li>Sam Bishop</li><li>Sequensis</li><li>Chloe Mortensen</li><li>Robert Matsuidaira</li><li>Brianna Pfost<br/></li></ul></li><li>ALL 38 KICKSTARTER BACKERS</li><li>ALL 90+ PLAYERS (including everyone that signed up late and not through the website)</li><li>ALL OF OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS</li><li>SULFUR STUDIOS SAVANNAH, HOST OF THE GALLERY SHOW</li><li>SCAD ICC</li><li>ALL 40+ ARTISTS THAT SUBMITTED ART FROM THE GLITCH ART / NEW MEDIA COMMUNITY</li></ul>\n<p> Thank you, this experience would not have happened without you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/736/736e709f0150e23c761172eef5376fad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Forward Instinct"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
