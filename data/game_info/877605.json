The games cover a wide variety of styles, genres, and themes as they fight against any definition of \"indie game\" as a genre.</p>\n<p>Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each contributor is paid\u00a0and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.</p>\r\nThis Month's Games\r\n<br/>Duty Hare! (Physical) by\u00a0Kyle Tam\r\n\n<p>Duty Hare\u00a0 takes place in the realm of Simulare, a world of swords, magic, and strangely high levels of personal debt. Unfortunately you have been shackled by the chains of that great beast known as capitalism, forcing you to become a Leporid - a taker of odd jobs that will force you to wander from dungeons to palaces to pubs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Built in the Down We Go OSR engine, Duty Hare is a cheeky little game poking fun at Task Rabbit and the Souls games in equal measure. This download includes the base rules, the Marketplace (for items to use), and a d20 table of Strange Encounters.</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nGAG (WIN) by\u00a0Joshua Roland\r\n\n<p>An interactive, dialogue-based psychological horror drama following the adventures of New York comedian Andy Barr and friends.</p>\n<p>Contains references to sexual abuse.<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Yoyo of Zonk (WIN/Source) by\u00a0kdx &amp; Mass\u00e9na\r\n\n<p>The Yoyo of Zonk is a local multiplayer zelda-like, where one player controls the main character (Zonk), while the other player tries to kill the first using various traps and enemies (The Mind). The Yoyo of Zonk can pretend to be a massively solo multiplayer visual novel farming sim if you ask nicely, it'll try it's best. Don't feed the game.</p>\n\n\n\r\nFactory Hiro (WIN/MAC/) by\u00a0belbeeno\r\n\n\n<p>Factory Hiro has you playing as Hiro Kikuchi as he oversees an assembly line.
