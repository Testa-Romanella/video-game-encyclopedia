Get with the times!  There's an app for that.   Throw away those silly paper numbers, and forget about calling out, \"Who's number 10?  10?  Anyone?  Does anyone have 10?\".  This new app does everything for you.  Besides, your family are friends are more than just numbers.  But wait, there's more!  People are randomly chosen to go next AND they are randomly given a specific Action to do.  Adding this twist to the original is guaranteed to increase the fun factor by at least 10.  10? Anyone have 10?<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/>&gt; Add Names of Family/Friends: Random selection of people.  How fun!<br/>&gt; Action Selector: No one knows what they will be doing on their turn.  The app tells them (Pick, Steal, Choice, Super Steal)<br/>&gt; Action Adjuster: Adjust the probability of each choice<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>1. Create and save lists for who's playing<br/>2. Slot Machine-like interface will select who goes next AND what they will do (Pick,Steal,Choice,Super Steal)<br/>3. As the game goes on, people will be removed from the list until no one is left.<br/>4. If a gift is stolen, tap on the Action slot to choose what that next person does.<br/>5. As the game progresses, you can adjust the probability of the Actions.  For example, increase Picks to end the game sooner, or increase Super Steal for more thievery hijinx.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2acdf1fb1bcb389368f9b7f53580a3_N0IlH6v.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Piusworks"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Piusworks"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
