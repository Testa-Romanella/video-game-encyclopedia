My goal was to represent a\u00a0loss of energy without quantifying it in a health bar.\u00a0<br/><br/>Shrinking space is used as a metaphor for loss of opportunities to explore and interact.\u00a0The game illustrates how our relationships to others and to our environment is impacted by limited mobility, as well as how the manifestation of symptoms can change how people with chronic illness are perceived, sometimes being misrecognized as lazy, disengaged, or reclusive.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy my tiny, autobiographical journey through the tensions and emotions that emerge when\u00a0we are not always able to stop and smell the roses.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Controls<br/>Move: WASD or arrow keys<br/>Interact: Alt/Z/J<br/></p>\n<p>This prototype was made in GB Studio with a combination of\u00a0original and free-to-use backgrounds, sprites, and music.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20eb331c0cc01f2664f4477fde1d09b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LinedWires"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
