You've woke up late, grab the essentials and run for the bus in time at 9! if you miss the bus that's it you are off the course, Carlo is still mad at you for uploading 2 weeks after the deadline of the last project. Objects are randomly generated all across the house and garden, find then all for the win Move with WASD, Click to pick up, Release to throw. Click the glowing yellow items to pick up, (the food isn\u2019t glowing don\u2019t worry, its safe) Each day completed will increase your score get the highscore!</p>\n<p>Created in a group of 4 at Global Game Jam 2021 with a 2nd place win at the Birmingham City University site. \r\n</p>\r\nMy Contribution\r\n<p>In this project I worked on the grab and hold mechanic, I used a ray-cast with a specified distance to detect what the mouse was pointing at. When the left mouse button is clicked the object it moved to a point specified by the level designer and made a child of that point so it moves with the player. Gravity is then turned off for this specific object so it looks as though the player is holding the object. When the left mouse button is release gravity is turned back on for the object and is the object is separated from the point. To give the releasing of an object a better feel force it added to the object so it looks like it is thrown.\r\n</p>\n<p>I also worked on the random spawn locations of the pickups that need to be found. The locations are set in an array so the designers can set spawn points from the Unity scene view making integration easy. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/74940193a56cbc4baca53a131a533574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nadia Nadeem"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
