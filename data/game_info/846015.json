Every sheep has a basic attack.  When you are ready press SPACE to fight the evil war machines. If all  your sheep are killed, it will be game over. Otherwise you have to kill  the war machines before the timer reaches 0. You get new sheep, if you  kill the war machine.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>https://github.com/Piturnah\r\n</li><li>https://github.com/AlexanderNoles\r\n</li><li>https://github.com/jbargu<br/></li></ul><p>Source code available on Github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fde9d202fd7be9b3e0b09bdcafbc0e0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jbargu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
