Easier up front, much more difficult after the first few worlds. If you find it&amp;#39;s too easy initially, don&amp;#39;t worry. The later missions are much... much more challenging. Stick with it to the end, you won&amp;#39;t regret it.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE GUIDE:<br/>Lars performs well on 2nd Generation iPods and Newer, and iPhone 3GS and Newer, as well as the iPad of course. iPhone3G is slower, but playable. First generation iPhone and iPod Touch not supported. If your gameplay seems slow, try switching to FULLSCREEN mode under Options for a speed boost.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbd6d1e5f3d5e2de78d28e5d6f515ac.jpeg", "website": "http://www.icarusinteractive.com/apps/lars.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Icarus Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Icarus Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
