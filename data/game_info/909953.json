The points of each round are added and the winner is the player who will first reach a certain goal.<br/>Inside the program you will find complete instructions on how exactly the game is played.<br/><br/>\"Xeri++\" supports all the known variants of the game:<br/>-2 or 4 players<br/>-4 or 6 cards in hand<br/>-16 or 24 points in each round<br/><br/>In the current version you can play against the computer or against other human players. <br/><br/>Against the computer: <br/>-\"Xeri++\" has one of the best Artificial Intelligence engines. In addition, however, you can choose the level of difficulty.<br/><br/>-The difference between the levels of difficulty has nothing to do with the way the computer plays (for example, it does not deliberately let you win and it does not cheat on you) but only with how many cards it remembers from what has been played. Thus, at the maximum level, the computer will remember all the cards that have been played, so it will never make a mistake, and as the level gets lower, the potential mistakes  are increased.<br/><br/>Against other human players via Wifi:<br/>-To connect with other play, ONLY ONE must connect as a \"SERVER\" and the others as \"CLIENTS\". The program uses the settings of the player-SERVER in the multiplayer game (number of players, score limit, etc). ATTENTION: If the player-SERVER disconnects, the game stops for all the other players!<br/>-The players-CLIENTS can be disconnected, and the computer will play in their place.<br/><br/>Statistics:<br/>For the geeks, the program offers complete statistics on the games you played, and even graphs!<br/><br/>Colors and designs:<br/>-In this new edition, you can choose from a wide range of designs for the deck and the background!<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>(If you face any technical issue please contact with email with us before leave any  reviews)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T06:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a40418bd3be717cb6c0602e67499264_nk2Nr5V.jpg", "website": "http://ellinikaprogrammata.eu/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Charisis Iliadis"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Charisis Iliadis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
