Each town offers a different price so sometimes its worth shopping around, but be careful as you must make your monthly payments to the bank!\u00a0Some towns have a shipyard for upgrades or repairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My entry for Godot WIld Jam 41, its not as complete as I had hoped but I think its better than my last entry.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>ON MAP:</p>\n<p>Left click on ocean or town and click on the ships wheel to go there. Right click clears route.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spacebar whilst sailing will abort the route or click STOP.</p>\n<p>Head to the fish as they spawn on the map, after so many days the fish will move on to another location.</p>\n<p>FISHING:</p>\n<p>Mouse up and down to raise/lower fishing line, when you get a nibble left click to begin the reeling in. Keep the green bar inside the moving box.</p>\n<p>MARKET:</p>\n<p>Sell your fish when the colour is bright green for the best returns, red means a bad deal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/862734e0e5dfc1562b589d569ab1fb38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Salv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
