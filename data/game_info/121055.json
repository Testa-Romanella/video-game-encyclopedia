She needs to find a way out.</p><p>You're part of the nation that wants to help her out. But you got only two hands. Hmm.. It's pretty enough!</p><p>7 stages only. Simple scene designs.<br/>No advanced control skills needed. You can grip the girl up and pick her down. Push her to walk. And there would be other objects to interactive with. You can clap your hands twice to pause/exit the game.<br/>No deaths. The less time you take to pass the game, the better you are.<br/>No gaming instructions. Use your brain wisely. Or it may take you long to pass all stages. (It took me less than 4 minutes though. ;D)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86f62bcb65fbc16bee64a62f0a214976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TangoChen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
