And \"Please, Don't Touch Anything\".\u00a0<br/><br/>We were arguing about name for a long time and didn't come to an agreement.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game has eleven endings and it counts as complete only if you managed to discover every one of them. And you get something special each time you find one.\u00a0<br/>Alt+Enter - fullscreen.\u00a0<br/>Hold reset lever to erase your savegame.\u00a0<br/>After you launch the game you'll have to wait a bit till it's loading (just a couple of seconds).\u00a0<br/>Also there's an android version, but some in-game buttons are small so it plays well only on big screens. Or you can use stylus.\u00a0<br/><br/>Enjoy and make sure you've read the instruction!\u00a0<br/><br/>P.S. It's 5 am here and we're glad we made it.\u00a0<br/><br/>Dmitry \"theRandom\" Lagutov - programmer\u00a0<br/>Dmitry \"deceiver\" Karimov - artist\u00a0<br/>Alexander \"finlal\" Vartazaryan - artist\u00a0<br/>Alexander \"blinch\" Goryeslavets - music, sounds\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, there is 3D-VR remake of the game:<br/>http://store.steampowered.com/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf0fcf60cd5aa59c597b714b8b165532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Four Quarters team"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
