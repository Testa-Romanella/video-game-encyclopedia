Usually, I work with very goofy cartoony things, so I wanted to be able to show people what else I could make. Two of my main goals during my studies were:<br/><strong>1.</strong> Have it be a very simple idea\u00a0due to being unfamiliar with the software and game design in general.<br/><strong>2.</strong> Try to use the least amount of assets possible without it looking super cheap and strange.<br/><br/>This will probably not be updated often or at all, but I'm keeping it as a prototype because I feel like adding onto it someday would be nice, and in the future, I'm sure I could implement the ideas in this much better.<br/>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can find me through @AnAnomalySpeaks on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Instagram\u00a0to see what else I'm usually working on.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0cbb2b44312526fdeb16f7951aac5f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["An Anomaly Speaks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
