Build up your virtues to prepare to meet the final boss \"<em>The Seven.</em>\"\u00a0A quick dungeon crawl\u00a0type play.</p>\r\nMore than just a game<p>This was my first game jam and boy, did I learn a lot! Especially about WebGL optimization and the finicky nature of WebGL rendering. What works in the editor may not work in the build. Particularly the render sort order.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, I'm now interested in getting better with pixel art. My daughter did all the character design and art in this game but I did a few props and FX. So I guess I'm not as afraid of it anymore. The background art is a free Unity Asset called\u00a0Rogue Fantasy Castle. I just didn't have the time to make all the background art.</p>\n<p>Programming is my wheel house and I still learned a few tricks there too. I also learned I get stuck in the weeds easily. Tweaking on some mechanic for way to long.</p>\n<p>All the audio is from freesound.org. Note worthy is the background ambiance music called Monk-04 by\u00a0\u00a0cormi. I did do all the editing and mixing of the FX. I urge everyone who uses freesound.org to donate a little. It is a wonderful resource.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy this quick little game.</p>\r\nThings that where cut due to time:<ul><li>Overheat mechanic for the BFG-R with upgrades to lengthen the time.</li><li>Each virtue was to be gained in separate levels. 7 total.</li><li>Player armor.</li><li>NPC Pope to follow you as healer.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77b5a3b0a2055c6965ae60c8c6a7b8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jandd661"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
