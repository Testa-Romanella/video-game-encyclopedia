Although the Age of Men is over, sapient beings still roam the Earth \u2013 robots. However, they are not at peace. Two warring factions exist: The Singularity, an entity intent on being the only sapient AI; and the Resistance, fighting to preserve their individuality.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou are Robotrooper, a member of the Resistance. Your outpost's security AI has been hacked by the Singularity and its defenses are now trying to kill you. To top it off, the self-destruct sequence has been activated as well. Your objective is to escape by reaching the exit on the ground floor before the outpost explodes.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p><em>Robotrooper: Survival\u00a0</em>was created as part of a university module assignment. Based on assignment specifications, it was to be a 1-2 minute game, made in Unreal Engine 4.13.X, using only the Blueprints Visual\u00a0Scripting language,\u00a0Starter Content\u00a0and custom assets made directly in the engine.
