In hopes one day I can publish something much greater that is actually worthy of anyone playing.</p>\n<p>Click on the blue circles to gain points based on the size of the circle. Each circle you click gains you 300 - 100 points and more combo, combo is a direct multiplier of how many points gained so it adds up quickly. The more combo you have, the more combo you gain aswell, at 10 combo you gain 2 per circle hit, at 50 you gain 3, the requirement to gain more combo sets multiplied\u00a05 times each time you reach one of those combo \"goals\"</p>\n<p>If you go more then a second without clicking any circles the combo breaks alerting you of this in the top left corner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6daf04e9c1170d6f286d42aa13c4591d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Guardian Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
