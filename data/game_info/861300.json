{"id": 861300, "slug": "mad-trapper", "name": "Mad Trapper", "name_original": "Mad Trapper", "description": "\r\nAfter narrowly escaping the catastrophic collapse of planet earth, you discover a top secret space station containing gateways to distant planets where intelligent life still exists. The only problem is, the critters that call these areas home are far more treacherous than anything you've known, and they don't take too kindly to outsiders. In this level-based, arcade survival adventure, you'll need to explore, outlast, and outgun your enemies on your quest for a new beginning. Hope and adventure await you on your journey, but so too does danger and destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLots of enemies<br/>\r\nEncounter a wide range of critters types - each with their own behavior profile and varying levels of aggressiveness, predictability and ferocity. Some may hide from you, others will help. Some may stalk you, but most will try to end you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLots of weapons<br/>\r\nRandomized weapon drops from equipment crates ensure ever-changing levels of firepower and strategy. Learn to master 30+ weapons while running and gunning through uncharted lands.<br/>\r\nSurvival is in your hands, and so is a fresh loadout.
