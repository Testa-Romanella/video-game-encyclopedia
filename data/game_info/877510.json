Humans and superhumans coexist on Earth. The vast majority of superhumans live on an immigrant island nation called Lochiodias.\r\n</p>\n<p>In addition to their special abilities, the archipelago of Lochiodias has a special mineral that carries the ability to analyze superpowers, called Crystal K or Klistonite, which can react with humans and help them analyze and reproduce others\u2019 memories in pictures.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. CDI is the capital of Lochi. Tuepia is the hometown where the protagonist Chen Weizhi lives, and Tailrae is the state that Tuepia belongs to.\r\n</p>\n<p>4. E.P. is a small seminar-style educational institution that provides higher education from the 10th grade of high school to the senior year of college. With only six students per class, E.P. generally recruits only superhumans for study.\r\n</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/2079b2467510336706cf0fc4893e5bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CityStream"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
