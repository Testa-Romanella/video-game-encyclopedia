This is where they select to play or build courses. The list of available blocks and props will be expanded in future builds.

Players can be notified if their best scored is beaten if they select to enter their email address (optional)</p>\n<p>Once again the grip is used to call the score card, that also allows the player to return the club house.</p>\n\n<p>This was built using the HTC vive and Unity and is under current development.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/8956c4dc172ade8681afe653a0576bc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XSpitFire"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
