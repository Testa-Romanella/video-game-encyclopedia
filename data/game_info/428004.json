{"id": 428004, "slug": "wizardpunk", "name": "Wizardpunk", "name_original": "Wizardpunk", "description": "A new group of young wizards has risen up. Out with the old, and in with the new. Old, white, long-beared men used to rule this tournament, and a place in the imaginations of people everywhere. But with a recent democratization of the tourney, every different type of sorcerer, witch, wizard, and mage that you could ever imagine have come out for their chance to show why they deserve to represent the realm.<h3>Characters</h3><br/><ul><li>Ignissa - A <strong>fire </strong>wizard who is joining to help her family get out of the neighborhood she grew up in.<br/></li><li>Aqua - A <strong>water </strong>wizard joining because her company has an incentive program that encourages representing them in the tournament. With a massive promotion in her sights, Aqua must decide if her career is really all that matters.<br/></li><li>Vito - A <strong>life </strong>wizard who has been raised by his church, to fight in this tournament for them. Vito must decide whether to help the church spread their Word or to forge his own path.<br/></li><li>Arc - An <strong>arcane </strong>wizard who, after a lifetime of being pushed around for being feminine, is ready to show everybody what he's made of. </li></ul><h3>Story</h3><br/>Every ten years, a huge tournament takes place in the magical world. The winner of this will be awarded <strong>money </strong>, <strong>fame</strong>, and one other <strong>very unique prize</strong> - an artist from another realm will immortalize them in a work of art. This other realm goes by the name of \"Earth\", so it takes an ancient spell to communicate the winner to the artist's mind. Since they lack magic, all of their famous (but fictional) magicians and wizards are actually <strong>skilled wizards from our realm</strong>. The energy needed to cast that spell is very great, which is why the tournament may only take place every ten years.
