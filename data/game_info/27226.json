Sixty stages await you, filled \n      with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly \n      difficult!\n    </p><p>\n      Places you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles \n      on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath.\n    </p><p>\n      As in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and \n      powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, \n      so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by \n      chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move \n      by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack.\n    </p><p>\n      Explore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's \n      Curse!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/941/941c9bad33b70a31679c88ca7cf7a48b.jpg", "website": "http://www.intense.jp/global/picdun2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["INTENSE"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["INTENSE CO."], "esrb_rating": null}
