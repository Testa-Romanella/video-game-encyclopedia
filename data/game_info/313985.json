Get ready to fail like crazy! Can you handle the challenge?<br/><br/>NORMAL MODE: Press down with your thumb and do not lift it off the black tiles. Collect as many black tiles as you can while avoiding the white tiles. Speed slowly increases. Can't keep up? Practice some more and you'll master it in no time!<br/><br/>ENDURANCE MODE: Press down and hold. Stay on the black tiles and avoid the white tiles. Speed will increase to tolerable levels then resets back to normal. How long you last depends on your will!<br/><br/>CLASSIC MODE: The classic game! Tap the black tiles and don't touch the white tiles. Choose between 25, 50, 100, or 200 tiles.<br/><br/>ENDLESS MODE: The classic game but endless! Tap the black tiles as the speed increases. Keep up with the speed or you lose!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab96d7a3230ac14540b30a849e096980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["KILLERBIT"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["KILLERBIT"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
