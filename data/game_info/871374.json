You can do this by clicking on a valid position on the grid.</p>\n<p>The AI themselves that try to catch Kyle uses different algorithms for their behavior.</p>\n<p>If Kyle is seen by the patrols then they will walk/seek directly towards him unless a wall is in the way.</p>\n<p>An obstacle avoidance pattern will make sure the AI runs around the walls and not through them.</p>\n<p>AI will otherwise walk around in set positions or random targets like a Wanderer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T06:08:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a2e998ddc98878e8604527066d5263b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JNAtamna"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
