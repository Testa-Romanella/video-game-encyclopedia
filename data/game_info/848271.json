It\u2019s B/W images, without any superfluous details, makes this last possibility especially print friendly and cheap. It also eases its modification \u201con the spot\u201d using pencils and markers. Being mostly blank rooms, and its lack of descriptive texts, the drawing doesn\u2019t give any clue of its content to the players, allowing GMs to adapt any description at the service of the particular needs of their story.<br/>Please, note that<strong>\u00a0this product doesn't include any commercial use allowing license</strong>.
