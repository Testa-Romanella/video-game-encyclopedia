Words stream in from the edges of the screen. By moving the pencil around with the arrow keys or WASD, you collect the words you desire. These are added to your current line, which you can finish by pressing Enter. Once you've completed five lines, you'll be able to copy your completed poem to your clipboard. It is a game of happy accidents. <br/><br/>Thanks for playing! :) If you'd like to share on Twitter, you can use the hashtag #PencilPoetics so other folks can easily find your work.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Font is Ubuntu Monospace (https://design.ubuntu.com/font/)</p>\n<p>The lists of words are from Darius Kazemi's Corpora (https://github.com/dariusk)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e48e46833729369770676450ff783b92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mirekstolee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
