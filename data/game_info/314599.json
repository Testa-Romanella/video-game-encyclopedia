It was 2010 and I was \u00a0first year student at university studying games design. Back then we used processing and I always wanted to remake it in Unity and after almost 9 years, here we are.</p>\n<p>The assignment at the time was to take a classic game, in my case it was Asteroids, and and change the gameplay. I have to be honest with you, I was focusing more on the colors and particles than anything else and it was a challenge making it look and feel exactly like \"the original\", down to font, music and colors.</p>\n<p>Maybe in another 9 years I'll add some gameplay elements to it to make it a bit more exciting.</p>\n<p>All shapes such as the aliens, planet, player and particles are all vectors!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:52:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4df72cc912239c36564ba1d63305764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wolf+void"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
