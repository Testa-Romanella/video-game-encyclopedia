As mayor, you'll need to build this city from the ground up and complete your empire. Construct houses, farms, lumber yards, quarries, and mines in order to collect resources. But, there's a catch. Each building has a dice number. Every new day, you'll roll the dice and only collect from buildings with that number. Use strategy to carefully choose your numbers and have the resources rolling in! But only if luck is on your side.<br/><br/>Inspired by popular board games like <em>Machi Koro</em> and\u00a0<em>Catan</em>, Tiny Dice Town brings tabletop gameplay right to your computer. It takes a clever mind to collect enough resources, build the three landmarks, and win the game.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to run this town? Let's find out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea9f0a5e6bea7ed253ff28c46e420d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RickyRicky"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
