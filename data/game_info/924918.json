This compounds for every branch and can get rather slow very quickly!! Use the time scale GUI in the top left to help manage the growth.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prune a branch by clicking on it, but be aware that the collision generated from Unity SpriteShape's is not very good (see screen shot, green outline).\u00a0 Pruning a branch will cause it to fall and disappear.</p>\n<p>Leaves will spawn every 3 to 8 seconds per branch and align upward..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some branches are stubborn and defy gravity and the tree itself!\u00a0 Make sure you prune those, 'cause they are not very zen (totally not a bug with constantly scaling child transforms).</p>\n<p>Let's see what kind of awesome trees you guys make!\u00a0 Use the screen shot button the top left to take a picture.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9e5699afb41a767183e98aaeb06140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["banedeath"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
