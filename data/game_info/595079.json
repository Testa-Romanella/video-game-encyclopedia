Every being living within its borders sings, chirps, or whistles in their high-pitched voices to express their supreme contentment. It must be stopped. Gloomby, you, will use their deep-humming gloom-spheres to vanquish all who dare to express their happiness! Gloom must come to the depths of the forest. And you must bring it there.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You begin at the edge of the forest where you must charge up your gloom spheres and use them to bellow at happy Felicitous. They will only be vulnerable if the pitch of your gloom is below the pitch of their song. As you approach, their song will be more audible but watch out, it will injure you with the sharp sting of happiness. </p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard only:\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys = to move the Player</li><li>Spacebar = Fire</li><li>R = Reload gloom spheres (Maximum inventory is 3)</li><li>A, D = Aim gloom spheres</li><li>S = Listen to the pitch of the current gloom sphere</li><li>F = Select a different gloom sphere</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard + mouse:\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys = to move the Player</li><li>Left Mouse button = Fire</li><li>Right Mouse button = Reload gloom spheres (Maximum inventory is 3)</li><li>Mouse Left/Right = aim gloom spheres</li><li>Mouse Back button = Listen to the pitch of the current gloom sphere</li><li>Mouse Forward button = Select a different gloom sphere</li></ul>\r\nGamepad:\r\n<ul><li>D-pad = to move the Player</li><li>Right trigger = Fire</li><li>South button = Reload gloom spheres (Maximum inventory is 3)</li><li>Right stick OR Left/Right Shoulder buttons = aim gloom spheres</li><li>West button = Listen to the pitch of the current gloom sphere</li><li>East button = Select a different gloom sphere</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Much appreciation to OpenGameArt.org the source of the tileset used in this game.
