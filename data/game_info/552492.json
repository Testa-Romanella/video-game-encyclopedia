I worked solo on the project\u00a0but\u00a0please note that for the sake of the game jam submission, both the art and music featured are not my own, and were free assets found on the internet. The project was created using Unity. This is my first ever game jam so I hope you enjoy my creation :)</p><p>In Eau de Dancer, the aim of the game is to score points by getting others to dance with you! In order for that to happen, you have to pick up bottles of fragrance to really make the right vibe for others. Be careful though, picking up too much in a short space of time could cause others to run away to escape the overpowering scent!</p><p>See how many points you can rack up by not having too much fragrance while standing next to others. Keep an eye on the clock, you only get a minute to get your groove on! Look out for time pickups that appear on the dancefloor, they'll extend how long you can keep the party going for!\u00a0</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>Run around using the <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>W, A, S, D</strong></li><li>Stand next to dancers to make them dance with you and score points (be careful you don't have too much fragrance when doing this!)</li><li>If your fragrance bar turns red nobody will dance with you. Hold <strong>space</strong> to make it empty quicker so you can get back to dancing!</li></ul><p><strong>Tips</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Different types of dancers have different tolerances, all dancers will dance when your fragrance bar is blue, but once it goes higher and starts changing colour, some dancer types might run away and you'll lose points! Experiment to find which dancers don't mind a bit more fragrance.</li><li>Time is invaluable, always try to find a route to a time pickup when you see one appear.</li><li>Aim for groups of dancers when you have a suitable level of fragrance. The more people dancing with you the more points you'll manage to score!</li></ul><p>The game can be played full screen if desired. I hope you have fun and please leave any feedback if you happen to try out the game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990b7a2f2e9d973e9a6fa77deac69c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loftus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
