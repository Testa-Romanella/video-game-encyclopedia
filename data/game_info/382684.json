Except you. You are the nightbird and now is the time for you to shine. Show them who\u2019s the most though bird in the neigborhood.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>You start with nothing and the goal is to capture all 7 nests. The most of them are guarded with birds who built them but have no pity for them. They are the same hostile beasts like you. Flying spends energy so be sure to hunt also some vermin crawling on the ground. You don\u2019t need to do it alone whole the time. You can raise your family which will help you with collecting food.</p>\n<p>For hunting or fighting you can use your claws obviously. If you\u2019d like to hit your enemy harder, use your sharp beak.
