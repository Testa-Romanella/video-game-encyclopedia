{"id": 271010, "slug": "my-planet-simulation", "name": "My Planet Simulation", "name_original": "My Planet Simulation", "description": "My Planet is a virtual simulation game where you take control of a planet and try to grow a healthy and thriving population!  It is like a virtual pet or Tamagotchi game on a planetary level.  Play God by manipulating the sunlight and the rain in order to grow as large a population as possible.  <br/><br/>My Planet runs in real time, even when the the game is closed.  Therefore, you must keep checking back throughout the day to make sure your planet is running at optimal levels.  The controls are simple to use, by mastery can take weeks.  Can you achieve the ultimate goal of growing your planet to over 1,000,000 people?  Or will your planet burn under the sun while your people anguish?  The choice is yours!<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline. <br/><br/>Vegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water. If you have too much, vegetation will flood out and die. To little, and drought will set in. Check your planet every day to make sure you have the optimal amount of sun and water!<br/><br/>I am always looking to improve my apps, so if you have any ideas on how to make My Planet better, please let me know.  I will continue to update and improve the game, so let me know what you would like to see added in the future!  This app is for you guys!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T04:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbef49819ac9dca52191e00f0a1b65f5_EQqY6Dy.jpg", "website": "https://apps.ape-apps.com/my-planet/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ape Apps", "Brandon Stecklein"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Brandon Stecklein"], "esrb_rating": null}
