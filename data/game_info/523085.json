The player must survive in a near-future world where the AI systems are considered by law to be \u201cGenies\u201d \u2014 malicious otherwordly creatures who must be destroyed along with their creators.<br/><br/><h3>The Story (long story short \u2014 it\u2019s all about the money)</h3>In the future, an acceptable level of economic growth is impossible without the AI. The lack of scientific method means the society is doomed to stagnate, face trade union conflicts, acts of civil disobedience, and populism\u2026 But not everyone is ready to cheerfully accept the potential solutions.<h3>A Story Inspired by Real Life</h3>It\u2019s rather naive to imagine that getting synthetic pets is enough to address the key issues without spawning new ones. When people cling onto life but abandon independent thinking, they eventually lose both. Isn\u2019t it time we stopped avoiding life and took our cue from the new forms that are currently busy proving their right to exist?<h3>You Have to Deserve Your Soul</h3>Do you know many people who don\u2019t cherish what they have? What if that kind of possession is merely an illusion? If you don\u2019t value something, you don\u2019t deserve it \u2014 and vice versa. This time it\u2019s about having a soul, and very soon many people will find themselves trailing behind the machines.<h3>A Future Cult Classic</h3>This game is bound to become a hit\u2026 once the world is swarmed by machines and algorithms. Buy it right now, before it comes out of Early Access and becomes too mainstream! You\u2019ll get some cool points to flaunt before your holographic grandchildren.<h3>GAME FEATURES:</h3><ul><li> Lots of game levels<br/></li><li> 3rd person combat system<br/></li><li> Skill system<br/></li><li> Dynamics and action<br/></li><li> Unique weapons of the future<br/></li><li> Exciting soundtrack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T06:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5a468ff6368b09f5db19863c0f9b3b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whale Rock Games", "CyberCry Creators"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Whale Rock Games", "CyberCry Creators"], "esrb_rating": null}
