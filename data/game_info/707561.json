Beware... the passcode isn't the only thing being withheld from you at the start!</p>\n<p>NOTE: While the game should run with a controller, a core of the game requires a keyboard to be available.<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I had a lot of issues trying to work out a flow for creating the Doom (199x) style sprites for the game. Lost a few days trying to get Blender to work with me. In the end, I had to do the main enemy sprite by hand... which is why it looks so bad.</p>\n<p>Due to this lack of time, the main game loop was hobbled together using a tool I had been working. I think, ultimately, it all works well, given things weren't really coming together until midnight the night before submission.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I thank everyone who tries out <strong><em>TermLiminal</em></strong>!! I greatly appreciate it!</p><p>For anyone interested in the source...<br/>The <strong><em>TermLiminal</em></strong>'s source is available on Github!<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\r\nMusic Attribution:\r\n<p>Song: Cyberpunk Moonlight Sonata v2<br/>Author: Joth<br/>Source: https://opengameart.org/content/cyberpunk-moonlight-sonata</p>\n<p>Song: Lines of Code<br/>Author: Trevor Lentz<br/>Source: https://opengameart.org/content/lines-of-code</p>\n<p>Song: Cyber Street Urchans<br/>Author: Eric Matyas<br/>Source: https://opengameart.org/content/cyber-street-urchins-looping</p>\n<p>Song: Cyberpunk Arcade 3<br/>Author: Eric Matyas<br/>Source: https://opengameart.org/content/cyberpunk-arcade-3-looping</p>\n\r\nSound Attribution:\r\n\n<p>File: terminal_chime.wav<br/>Original Name: nameit5.wav<br/>Original Author: bumpelsnake<br/>License: CC3.0<br/>Source: https://freesound.org/people/bumpelsnake/sounds/456581/</p>\n<p>All other sound effects made by myself!<br/></p>\n\n\n\r\nGraphics Attribution:\r\n<p>Particle effects made by Kenney<br/>The hand sprites were slightly modified from a set I had found on the ZDoom forum.
