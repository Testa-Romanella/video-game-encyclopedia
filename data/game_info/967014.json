Brave Trial is one of the sequels, where the player, as a new recruit of the Star Authority, travels to the target planet and completes a very crazy rodeo, after earning an achievement medal and being able to turn on the Endless Mode. This time around, we've reworked and upgraded the Lightship spacecraft under the URP rendering pipeline for a smoother experience and more realistic scenes. The gameplay has also been greatly updated, completely abandoning the level maps of the EA version.<br/>\r\nIn Brave Trial, the newbie spawn point is still in the Light Boat spaceship, but this mission will be very crazy, in the arena of the target planet, there will be a large number of monsters entering the ground, but don't worry, I have enough weapons for you, you can summon allies during the battle, and fight alongside you. Once you successfully pass the tenth wave of attacks, the game will turn on endless mode, and if you like light ROUGE, you will also love this VR game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T04:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a10065ad452039f780f7103a83673adb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LI YIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LI YIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
