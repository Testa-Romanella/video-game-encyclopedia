{"id": 964517, "slug": "project-rogue-2", "name": "Project Rogue", "name_original": "Project Rogue", "description": "Project Rogue is a roguelite, first-person dungeon crawler inspired by classic RPGs with a modern touch. Explore the endless dungeon as you kill monsters, level up, and collect loot. The dungeon is procedurally generated so it will always be a different experience. Find magic items to improve your character so that you can survive boss fights in deeper levels. The class you select determines your starting equipment, and then you choose how your character progresses. Will you play a hardened fighter wielding two-handed weapons? Or perhaps a spell caster that overwhelms enemies with magic? You are in control.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Procedural content generation<br/></li><li>Old school RPG vibe<br/></li><li>Stat-based progression<br/></li><li>Character customization<br/></li><li>Endless replayability</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T02:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4dac5da54e797d137133e015c0464c20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Jensen", "Michael McCluskey"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thomas Jensen"], "esrb_rating": null}
