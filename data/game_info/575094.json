Boy o boy, this is a demo where you try to get to the other end to score.. but which way?! The t.v. sceen sometimes gets \"interception\" in its signals. when the playfield changes colors its the opposite direction you should go! The signal jamming doesnt last long though, so strategy may be best to wait it out if you are close to the original goal! You are the player with the \"F\"ootball!!! Enjoy only for Gameboy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc030847a57dceafb33e68bc523b941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game portal...."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
