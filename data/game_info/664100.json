I'm still new and still learning how to do stuff in unity. I learned a lot of stuff doing this project but I have no intention to keep working on it so I'm uploading this just for the sake of documenting\u00a0it. Maybe this will inspire someone to make something, I don't know. There really isn't much to this prototype though, I just had a lot of fun modelling the weapons and building the environment.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Space Bar - Jump</p>\n<p>Control - Crouch</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Attack</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Zoom</p>\n<p>1, 2 and\u00a03 - Change Weapons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:04:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc836e3a8474f523e45757cdb7450d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vahellis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
