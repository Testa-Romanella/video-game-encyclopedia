On to what the series is about:\r\n<p><strong>Artificial Knowledge takes place somewhere in the future where humanity is at a large-scaled battle against every unit of the entire\u00a0rogue AI population worldwide.\u00a0 As time passed by since the \"main incident\", the entire body count decreases, and the human race is scattered all around.\u00a0 Up until now, they start to regroup entirely of whoever is left alive and repel the full\u00a0occupation of artificial intelligence and find the source of the cause that started the entire battle, and cease it from occurring ever again.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Release Status of Artificial Knowledge mini-games:</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>AK Small Teaser - Released</li><li>AK: The Gathering - In development</li><li>AK: Blind Sights - Not Started</li><li>AK: Pacified Escape - Not Started</li><li>AK: Pre-Series - In development</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>This page will be updated once there are changes confirmed.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Check out my YouTube channel(s) below:</p>\n<p>Primary:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC61l8D0IuJDU1YfwyA1hYpw?view_as=subscriber</p>\n<p>Secondary:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1FSJG2RXs9SsMuPbkZaYIA?view_as=subscriber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:35:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0c900c59d3a74f967e04f71002f8b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\\OVS Creations/"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
