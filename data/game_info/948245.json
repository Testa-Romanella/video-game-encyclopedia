This made me want to make a game with three levels that got increasingly difficult, with a boss battle at the end. So the three changes I made were: I created a complex level 2 that required you to travel a large map and find the keys to different doors in order to get to the goal that took you to the second level. This included adding enemies in areas where you would have to go and acid along the way as well. I felt this gave the player a more challenging feeling than level 1. The second modification I made was that I made a final level that included multiple doors, hard-to-reach places to move, and acid floors, so if you feel sick, you'll die and have to go back to the checkpoint that you made. The last modification I made was that I made two mini-boss enemies for the final level. This was one on a platform that youd have to defeat to get past to get the key to move farther upward, and that was one that was really fast and in the way to get a key to get to the final door. I am extremely pleased with this game; I feel like it is the best one.
