Thats mainly the reason why there is no sound and the graphics are far from perfect, but I had a lot of run making the game and I hope some of you still enjoy it</p>\n\n<p>In \"Number Sniper\" you have to click the numbers on the screen in the right order. For every connection after you pressed \"finish\" you get 1 point.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Row: 1 - 2 - 3 = 2 Points (2 Connections)</p>\n<p>For a full row (1 to 10) you get 10 points</p>\n\n<p>But watch out sometimes the numbers you collected can get <strong>INVERTED\u00a0</strong>and your row could get destroyed</p>\n\n<p>For every round you have 30 seconds to get the highest score, after this you can try again to beat your previous score</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\nActionInput PCInput MobileCollect/Snipe NumberClicking on Numbers (Mouse)Clicking on Numbers (Touch)<br/>Finish RowF / Click on Finish ButtonClick on Finish ButtonReset RowR\u00a0 / Click on Reset ButtonClick on Reset Button\r\n<p>[Game is playable on mobile in your browser]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:50:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0d7fc6cfdf4d95a72d988824bc767f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bluuewolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
