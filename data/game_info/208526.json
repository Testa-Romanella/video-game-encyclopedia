I plan on adding in a functional vent system, swapping the traps for an electrical equivalent, add wall textures and adding in enemies for the player to defeat. We also plan on adding an upgradable weapon and/or skill, so this will also be added in the next build (hopefully).</p><p>Which assets you used from the asset store or other source?
