Select a clan and attempt to settle this unwelcoming land, but you\u2019ll need to choose your strategy wisely to survive the ever increasingly harsh toll of winter and complete your saga.</strong><br/><br/><br/>The thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder, Landnama is a survival strategy game that forces you to carefully decide your next step. Explore the land and discover hidden challenges and powerful landmarks. Build your settlement and brace for the punishing Winter\u2019s Toll. Settle each region with differently skilled clans while facing ever increasing challenges and no second chances.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Only one resource exists in the game, Heart, but it must be invested wisely. Heart can be gained in many ways, whether you want to focus on exploring the land as a hunting clan or by building your settlement into a thriving production hub. Establish a completed settlement before winter takes your final heart, but how you get there is up to you.<br/><br/><br/>This isn't your typical Viking game, there is no combat or raiding. These are farmers, explorers, and builders. But conflict isn\u2019t missing, it comes in the form of a harsh winter that you\u2019ll need every bit of your focus to survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Landnama is a taxing race against time with an ever present ticking clock pushing you always closer to winter, but it\u2019s also a beautiful world where you can freeze time and enjoy the atmospheric music and art. Explore in detail the settlement you\u2019ve built and the animated denizens that populate it.<br/><br/><br/>We\u2019re a small, passionate team of friends that are excited about bringing you a different kind of Viking game. We hope you enjoy it and appreciate your support!<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339040/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T20:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6081f6b90a549f6ca0996e279ae18dd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sonderland"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Sonderland"], "esrb_rating": null}
