Though it was painful but worthwhile. I couldn't polish and add music in\u00a0the game because of some sudden urgency. I'll try to fix those when my Semester pressure will be a lil'bit less. I'm still pretty happy with the result considering it is my 2nd game and 1st time using unity.\u00a0Anyways I wish you guys will have fun playing it.
