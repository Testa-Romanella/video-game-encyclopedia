Remember: no ware should pass and matching the wrong color means losing score. Your objective is simple but tough. You can use the rails with button [1] to [3]. It's only important that the right color is moved over the right field and you push the right button at the right time. If the wrong color should pass, not a problem, you have three lives. If three wrong ware are collected, it's game over and you collect your score.<br/>Hint: Don't complicate things, three rails can be confusing. Keep an eye on the whole map and work foresighted. <br/><br/><br/><br/>You can unlock new maps with points, that get more difficult and represent new situations. If the standard modes are too easy, try the modes [Inverted Ways] or [Random Maps], where the normal rules don't apply.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/047/047821730a17eee5789437e35f534f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PIxelssoftworks"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PIxelssoftworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
