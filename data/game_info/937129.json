However, some remnants of a curse still seem to be lingering in these walls and around the castle\u2019s owner in particular\u2026</p>\n<p>Although many areas of the castle are steadily being opened to visitation one by one, the entire library has remained sealed. The Beast is adamant that someone with the necessary skills and determination to maintain it must be hired before he will consider opening it to the public. There are also several books that have suffered various degrees of damage over the years\u2026 and they must certainly be fixed before the grand opening!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, after the lengthy curse that fell upon the Beast\u2019s current staff, there are not many who are willing to join their ranks.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are willing to trade the chance of being cursed for employment and access to a fantastical library, the Beast would appreciate your application.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T10:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a7a7a33e65fd82ceddaaddcbadd4b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["somewhere with stories"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
