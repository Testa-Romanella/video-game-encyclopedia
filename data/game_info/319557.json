One could argue that unnecessary restrictions are at the core\r\nof what gives a video game its challenge, and here we have one where even your tools are giving you\r\na hard time carrying out your goals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <em>Dirt Life Radar</em>, the UI will only display one of the following\r\nelements vital to gameplay at a time: a health bar, a radar or how much ammunition you have. It\u2019s\r\nimportant to time your movements wisely and keep yourself out of danger for as long as you can.\r\nDuring development the idea shifted from a game where you pick and choose your UI elements into\r\none where they are fickle enough to just shift every ten seconds, but the concept still has the same\r\nstyle of unpredictable gameplay at its heart.\u00a0Have fun playing!</p>\n<p><em>Made for the 2018 UKIE Student Game Jam.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Dat Bui</p>\n<p>Dan David</p>\n<p>Uche Okorie</p>\n<p>Bradley Dean</p>\n<p>Lenore Linsell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T04:58:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90c0a2f4a48ea04f35b0c0e27639a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the great sage games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
