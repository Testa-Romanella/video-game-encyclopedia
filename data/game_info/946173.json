{"id": 946173, "slug": "strategic-destructor", "name": "Strategic Destructor", "name_original": "Strategic Destructor", "description": "<p>Strategic Destructor is a game built with Unity Engine inspired by Crush the Castle. The idea behind the game is that you have to knock down structures, but you have to do so strategically because some parts must remain standing. This game is a prototype and has a lot of room to grow.<br/><br/>The player can move their camera around the structure 360 degrees, as well as adjusting the up-down / left-right aiming of the canon. There are several camera modes available by pressing tab. The first camera mode is a view from directly behind the canon. The second lets the camera orbit the structure. The last view is an orthographic view from the side which makes it feel like you are playing a 2D game like crush the castle (although functionally it is kind of useless as it is impossible to tell what your shots will hit).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T14:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebff408d9b02258db49980872a3e63c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supetorus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
