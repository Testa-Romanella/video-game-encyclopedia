After collecting all of your Spherian friends, make your way to the goal flag!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>**Q &amp; A**</p>\n<ol><li>If you had to retake this course and do it all again, what would you have done differently the second time?<ol><li>If I had the chance to take the course again, I think I would spend more time working on level design for my game. I think after I got the first four levels completed for my game, I kind of backed off on level design and focused a lot on the audiovisual aspects of my game. Had I focused on levels more, I think I would have been able to make some really dope designs for levels.</li></ol></li><li>Would you expand this game or continue working on this game in the future? Why or why not?<ol><li>I would like to expand this game in the future, possibly over the summer, because there are still some ideas\u00a0and features I would like to implement, like power-ups, and more enemies. For some reason the thought of a 2 player battle mode sounds like a fun idea to add, and definitely more levels!</li></ol></li><li>In terms of process, has making this particular game changed how you approach making games in general?<ol><li>I think making this game has changed my perspective on how to approach games, in the way that I worry more about gameplay when compared to\u00a0 audiovisual aspects. When I made games last semester in Intro to Programming for Games, I worried a lot about how my games would look instead of how the played. Now I'm much more gameplay focused, and won't touch aesthetic until my gameplay is refined!</li></ol></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c560be4a22d162073e1ea69effa33c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zayzizzurp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
