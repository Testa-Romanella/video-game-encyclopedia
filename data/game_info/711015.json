Use your mouse to rotate the flashlight. Teddy bears don't like light.</p>\r\nTrijam\r\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Trijam #149. The theme was\u00a0<strong>Flipped</strong>. There was a 3 hour limit to play games but I went over and it took me a little over 3 hours to make. Even though I failed to make a game within the time limit, I wanted to share what I had done.\u00a0I made the game in 3 hours and 30 minutes.</p>\r\nIdea\r\n<p>Did you too when you were little flipped the light switch and run back to your bed so monster in the dark didn't have time to get you ? In this game, you need to do this but this time, you have a reason to run. Teddy bears will run torward you and try to kill you. Go back to your bed without getting catch.</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>I used the\u00a0Tiny Bundle\u00a0pack made by\u00a0Vryell. All the visuals were taken in this pack. No art were made during the game jam. Go take a look at\u00a0Vryell's\u00a0work it's amazing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:48:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40a/40a1d75efa0acf011f15412e94b9d130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LouShunt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
