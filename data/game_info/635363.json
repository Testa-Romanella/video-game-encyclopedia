From turning on/off lights to altering the environment around you, it is made clear you are not supposed to leave.<br/><br/>The spirit has the ability to:<br/>- Turn on/off the lights.<br/>- Turn on the radio.<br/>- Open and close doors.<br/>- Appear as a shadow figure every now and then.<br/>- Haunt various items and furniture within the rooms, which alters their appearances. Some items/furniture have two stages of alteration while others just have one.<br/>- Cause the phone to ring.<br/><br/>The spirit's behavior is completely randomized, meaning a different experience for each player. Depending on how long you play, you may not even see all of the various alterations of the environment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T04:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10a72944945785e6cdc0979bea5f0927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HollowPixels"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HollowPixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
