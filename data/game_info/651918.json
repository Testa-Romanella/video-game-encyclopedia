Overall it's\u00a0missing a lot of features, but has the bare-bones for a bigger project. I could of spent an extra 30 minutes finishing up some touchups like a score screen or music, but as I was already over the allotted 3 hours I didn't want to push too much further.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy, and feel free to leave feedback :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:48:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a56a53a354cb9b05cb5c699764b3bc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Banana Jelly"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
