These messages contain a pitch and, on arrival, will make the receiver sound to it. The pitch is decided randomly from the Sender's pitch range.</p>\n<p>Each agent has an Instrument, a Note, a Volume and a Pitch Range, which can be completely changed by the users to make their own compositions.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Hand Tool</em>\u00a0- Controls all aspects from agents. Left click will change the Instrument/Note/Volume/Pitch Max. or Min to their next level, and right click will take it to the previous level. The upper part of the pitch circle is the maximum and the lower part is the minimum. If they are equal, the pitch is fixed to that value.</li><li><em>Add Agent</em>\u00a0- Adds an agent to the point clicked on the scene. Any click works.</li><li><em>Delete Agent</em>\u00a0- Deletes the clicked agent.</li></ul>\n<p>Check out the code at my Github repository!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7e7ecf89a1f3db4393ba6a6df530cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Olsyx"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
