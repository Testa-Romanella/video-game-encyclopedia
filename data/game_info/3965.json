{"id": 3965, "slug": "binary-domain", "name": "Binary Domain", "name_original": "Binary Domain", "description": "<p>Humanity has just solved problems like global warming - with the help of robots. Robot assistants were American, behaved correctly and differed from people clearly. But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies.<br />\nThe game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player&#39;s actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2012-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T07:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bcd/bcd9896b7c3b9fa80e5dcb67c961e2be.jpg", "website": "http://www.sega.com/binarydomain/", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 277, "owned": 3647, "beaten": 350, "toplay": 67, "dropped": 132, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 127, "ratings_count": 534, "suggestions_count": 566, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 537, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Devil's Details"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
