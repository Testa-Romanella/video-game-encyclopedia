Indeed, the enemies have been designed to be engaging to avoid and rather difficult to pass, roughly increasing in difficulty as the player progresses through the game, so single-player becomes a thrilling challenge in itself.</p>\n<p>The game features several elements of randomness, whether in the randomly-generated level orders, the random movements of mobs like the chickens, or the random power-ups that a player receives upon contact with a chest, such that each round of gameplay is unique and consistently exciting. <br/><br/>The challenging nature of the game inspires the player to keep practising and improving their abilities to avoid enemies and the knowledge of the maps.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T04:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cff85efeeb9b1b3a8049030576c38c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArmenZ"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
