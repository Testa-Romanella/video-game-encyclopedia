Right click to deselect hunter. When selecting, clicking on the deer will shoot it. Red hunter shoots horizontally and vertically and Green hunter shoots Diagonally (It\u2019s a bit weird because the game is \u201crotated\u201d. When you play you\u2019ll see what I mean) and both have a range of 2 tiles. Stepping on sticks or shooting will startle the deer and they will start running to the nearest exit. You can use this to your advantage and you can try intercept the deer (The deer run in a set pattern, no randomness i.e it is predictable). Press R to restart the game if it bugs out or whatever.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/561fe013bd72e789901b577a83bd34bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheZingThing"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
