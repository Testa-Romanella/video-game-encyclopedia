Later on, after the assignment was complete, I decided to continue to work on Poly World and make it a full game!</p>\n\r\n[NOTE]\r\n<p>This game is currently in development! I'm working as\u00a0hard as possible to get this game finished / in a playable state for everyone to play! Sadly I'm super busy with college so I don't have a lot of time to work on Poly World, but I'm doing my best!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f30fdb2ca1f44a82bc0560b2788e148e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SeppahBaws"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
