Clear them out.</p>\n<p>This game is such a long-time-coming. I started it back in like 2017 or something. Back then it was a totally different idea, way too ambitious. So after years of starting and stopping, a few different iterations, I've finally settled on this. A very simple FPS Platformer. I'm honestly just happy to finally finish it.</p>\n<p>Hope You Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Movement = WASD</em></p>\n<p><em>Jump = SPACE</em></p>\n<p><em>Shoot = LMB</em></p>\n<p><em>Pause = TAB</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8717e31a7b737a389030e093f2d4c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["7thArtificer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
