Talk to characters and solve inventory puzzles as you attempt to uncover the mystery.  <br/><br/><br/><strong>The Severn Rising 2222 Features<br/><br/>* Hand drawn illustration by artist Sarah Millin.<br/><br/>* Classic point &amp; click interface.<br/><br/>* Fiendish puzzles.<br/><br/>* 20 unique locations to explore.<br/><br/>* A cast of characters to meet &amp; interact with.<br/><br/>* Fully voiced dialogue.</strong><br/><br/><br/>This is a short game originally intended for public display at locations around Worcester.  Suitable for all ages.<br/><br/><br/>Dominated by the River Severn which flows through it, Worcester is already at the mercy of nature, and regularly experiences flooding which leads to residents and wildlife alike, modifying their lifestyle. The Severn Rising 2222 project, challenges the player to learn more about climate change, pollution and the direct impact it will have on their community.<br/><br/>The game brings together beautiful, vibrant depictions of nature and Worcester\u2019s landmarks by artist Sarah Millin, with the game design skills of Paradise Multimedia. The game was developed through a series of creative workshops held in heritage, cultural and environmental venues, across Worcester during 2022. The workshops encouraged participation from a wide demographic of Worcester residents and explored environmental impact through art.<br/><br/>The voices and ideas of the residents of Worcester, form the basis of the Severn Rising illustrations and animation and the engagement of the community was central to placing the project at the heart of The City.  An exciting legacy of the workshops were the messages in a bottle written by the workshop participants. The messages provide a tantalising prediction of how participants envisage Worcester to look in 200 years\u2019 time.<br/><br/>A key feature of the game is the beautiful Worcester locations that the characters visit, which are based upon the partner sites and buildings which the artists felt held a special interest to the community.   There is a real array of architecture in Worcester\u2019s skyline, and this is reflected in the mixture of Tudor, Victorian and Brutalist building that are highlighted in Severn Rising. <br/><br/><strong>Now you have read all about the development of the project, why not be transported 200 years into the future in flooded Worcester and experience The Severn Rising 2222 for yourself?</strong><br/><br/>The Severn Rising 2222 project has been made possible through generous support of the Arts Council England, Elmley Foundation &amp; Worcester City Council.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed6f5a6db7bd1619e9d140edd9b52026.jpg", "website": "https://thesevernrising2222.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Paradise Multimedia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Paradise Multimedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
