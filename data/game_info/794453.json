The challenge was to make a game in 10 days using only free assets (or created assets), and my personal challenge was to create a game with dialogue branching and multiple levels.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I spent too long on the programming side of things and kind of neglected the actual level design and making sure the game was fun. Still, I'm proud of the progress I've made, especially since this is only my second game I released for a jam.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it! Leaving a comment with your honest feedback would be truly appreciated!</p>\n<p>You can find the list of assets along with the source file on the game's GitHub page: https://github.com/AlexRezdan/GameDevTV-Game-Jam-2022<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fe1384655f02e7c6c19c1b97d4cc30e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rezdan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
