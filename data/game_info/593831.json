Play as the Congress of Crows or the Colony of Mice as they seek to conquer the valley of Brookwood.<br/></p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, this is a prototype built in a few days for a game jam. It's janky, with many bugs. However, be warned that the Arena 1 map is pretty broken, and I never got around to finishing the Arena 2 map due to that</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had fun though brainstorming for this project, and will likely return to Brookwood in some form in the future. Maybe a full release of a Gameboy Color game, or maybe on a different platform.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Click on a unit with 'A' to move them.\r\nClick 'Fight' to engage the enemy, or press 'B' to cancel.\r\nPress 'Start' or 'B' to end the turn before both player units have moved.\r\nPress 'Select' to check your current HP.\r\n</p>\n<p>During the enemy turn, enemy units will target the nearest player unit and attack if within range.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/664ae09bc58c9d92a00ae1fedcd0cef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jaredchansen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
