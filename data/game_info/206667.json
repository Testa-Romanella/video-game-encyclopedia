Base credits are Code: Steve Flagg Music: Ryan Downs Character Art: Sean Clair.</p>\n<p>Note: It appears that full credits for this game have gone missing (I.e. the domain where\u00a0I was hosting them expired and I have no idea where I stored them). If you made assets that are in this game and I did not properly credit, please send me a message so I can give you proper credit.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrows move</p>\n<p>Spacebar Jumps</p>\n<p>You can jump on the Skeleton's heads</p>\n<p>Ultimately the goal here is to do\u00a0Zeus' Trials\u00a0(See Chores) to become 13th god. (Find the items in the world.)</p>\n<p><strong>My Thoughts on this game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was the first jam game and my first and only game I've worked on in a group setting. I learned A LOT making this game, despite it's well horribleness. It was my first foray into state machines\u00a0(and not a good implementation of it either) and really building a platformer in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our original idea was very grand and eventually was paired down to a basic platformer that has some really messed up collisions.</p>\n<p>Note: This was not originally a browser game. So, in turn it may be a bit on the buggy side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6fedb094cd50c777a7b6afb924b73a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steve Flagg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
