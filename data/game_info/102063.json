This is my first game I've made. It's actually 2 games in one uwu It was a game made in a week so the art isn't spectacular and some sprites are weird so I might update with better art sometime.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this game is a dating sim! It's set in high school with 2 routes: one female and one male.\u00a0One about comforting and the other is horror-esk.\u00a0Both with multiple endings! It features 2p!Belgium and 2p!Hong Kong which are Hetalia-based characters but don't worry!\u00a0You don't even have to know what Hetalia is to play!\u00a0Anyone is welcome and each story is built so no matter who you are, you'll enjoy playing it.\u00a0 (Beta testers enjoyed it, both Hetalians and non Hetalians)</p>\n<p>Please let me know if there is any bugs or spelling errors!
