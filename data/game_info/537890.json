Starting as a update to my first mod, Everred, it grew into a full sequel, and eventually into the biggest Celeste Classic mod ever released (and potentially one of the biggest pico-8 projects).</p>\n<p>The mod is over three times the size of the original game, and features brand new levels, mechanics, sprites, and music (huge thank you to my friends Augie745 and RubyRed for the absolute bops they made)!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Z - Jump</li><li>X - Dash</li><li>Arrow Keys - Move</li><li>E - Toggle Flashing Effects</li></ul>\n<p>Lots of credit to Maddy and Noel from EXOK Games for the original game, and to the Celeste Classic Discord for all the help and feedback. Extra special thank you to Gonen and Meep, who helped optimize, compress, and fit everything into one PICO-8 cartridge. This project wouldn't have been possible without them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1d/b1d3c130980881d41f21d632ce9bfa22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["taco360"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
