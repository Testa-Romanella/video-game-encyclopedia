It currently has one level to test more will be added soon it has an end goal and it also has zombies (dont know if i will call them that in the future). When you reach the giant WIN sign go into the room to \"beat\" the level for now it will only restart until more levels are added or maybe even a bigger level with more weapons and enemies that are bigger and stronger. Bullets do not disappear as of now.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd607498e3edd657bb267bf05ee926de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsJustMike"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
