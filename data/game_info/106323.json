{"id": 106323, "slug": "spooked", "name": "Spooked", "name_original": "Spooked", "description": "<p><strong>Spooked\u00a0</strong>is a murder mystery where you play in the lead role as Detective Spook who solves crimes by speaking to the ghosts of the recently departed. Using a kind of clairvoyance or remote viewing, you will earn trust of the deceased and solve the crimes by exploring their memories of the events leading up to their murders.</p>\n<p>On this case, Detective Spook is called out to an old, abandoned house with its own dark past to solve a new case involving six deceased teenagers. While the locals just think it's a haunted house with a few scares and surprises, a group of six teenagers--brought together through common misfortune for a night of fun--soon discover there is something more to the house.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The idea behind the game is to play the role of a detective who has special abilities he can use to solve crimes. It means the user gets to go into a crime scene without any prior background knowledge about it, and explore it for the first time, piecing together the clues to solve the mystery of who done it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I\u00a0am a first-time game developer. I'm shocked I can even say that now.\u00a0I never made a game before in my life, and I decided with around two and a half weeks to give this IGMC 2017 contest a go. Needless to say, it was an overwhelming task to try and come up with an original idea, story, game-play, and then implement it into a full-fledged game using a software tool (RPG Maker MV) that I only toyed around in before. Alas, here I stand ready to reveal to the judges, other participants, and anybody else the fruits of my labor. I spent a lot of time the past two weeks--and I mean a lot--to come up with this game. I hope that others can enjoy it as much as I hoped they would when I originally put pen to paper. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>C.
