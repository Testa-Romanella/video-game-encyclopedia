You have two missions that are required to be completed before progressing to the next level.<br/><br/>1) You must find and collect valuable moon rocks located throughout the moon base. In order to find the moon rocks, you need to look at your map and then track down the rocks and load them into your lunar buggy.<br/><br/>2) Once you collect all the moon rocks on the level, you then need to locate the parking zone. Once this special zone is located, you need to carefully park your lunar buggy on the parking zone.<br/><br/>All of this might sound easy, but you are up against adverse conditions, various obstacles, and zero gravity! Good luck!<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>- 10 levels to complete.<br/>- 3D graphics.<br/>- All lunar vehicles are unlocked!<br/>- Multiple sterring options.<br/>- Multiple camera views!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/56181479b2b3757275d551f2e1119be6_DAoZql5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Skullbox Games", "Scott Earle"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Skullbox Games Pte", "Scott Earle"], "esrb_rating": null}
