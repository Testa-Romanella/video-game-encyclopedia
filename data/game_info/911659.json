Traverse through two levels in your space-faring blimp and escape the alien planet, while bypassing their numerous\u00a0defences to return to the safety of Earth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developed as a high school project then finalized as a\u00a0personal project, making it the first game I had made!</p><p>Source is available at:\u00a0https://github.com/The-Liam-Blair/Extraction</p>\n\n<p>FEATURES</p>\n<p>- Two levels, each finalized with their own unique boss.</p>\n<p>- Five enemies, with each enemy having a chance to appear as an upgraded variant, featuring a more advanced design and improved combat abilities!</p>\n<p>- Two ways to fight! Utilise the frontal laser to inflict rapid damage to any targets directly ahead and also make use of the bomb bay to drop explosives on any foolish foes below.</p>\n<p>- Overwhelmed by enemy fire? Do not forget to use the handy energy shield, which remains active while the frontal laser is not in use. It can block and destroy any incoming projectiles, but will not save you from collisions with ships!</p>\n<p>- Crude hand-pixeled animations and art by yours truly.</p>\n<p>- One life! (Turns out a blimp cannot survive an explosion from an experimental alien bomb, who knew?)</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS - Movement</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR - Fire frontal laser.</p>\n<p>B - Launch a bomb from the bomb bay.</p>\n<p>ESC - Close the game.</p>\n\n<p>F - Skip to level two (Note: Be sure to wait a few seconds after the game starts and then\u00a0use this cheat, otherwise unexpected behaviour (Like flying turrets) may occur!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6ea5ac66fea67ae1911cb9638b2a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Blair"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
