{"id": 491720, "slug": "war-war", "name": "War War", "name_original": "War War", "description": "War War is a 4-player multiplayer real-time / turn-based strategy game intended to be played with friends locally or across the internet.   Build small armies by placing your pieces on the board in the turn-based \"campaign\" mode.  Invade other armies to enter real-time strategy \"skirmish\" battles where up to two units can be controlled at once with the dual-analog stick on your compatible game controller! (keyboard controls are also supported).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach unit type has unique abilities such as machine gunner soldier infantries, cannonball-launching tanks, and missile-firing drones.  Armies can be combined on the strategy map to build even stronger forces.  Random mystery spaces add a party-like element to the game and can drastically change the tides of a war campaign.  When playing with 3 or 4 players, \"ridiculous\" barn animals can be controlled to get in the way and disrupt skirmish battles between the two battling players.  Battle across 4 different terrain types and 3 unique strategy campaign maps.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45ebb27eb4051ffb8c106d2ee63e8c5c.jpg", "website": "https://vertostudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Verto Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Verto Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
