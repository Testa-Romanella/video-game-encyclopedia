In \"Z\", your only button is the Z button! You hold down the button to charge up a bar, the longer you hold, the different the direction. This concept has great potential for unique strategy games and roguelikes where moves are intended to be well thought out. Feel free to use this concept in your own game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b64c848d1c519801039cf7164caca1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Le Dook"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
