Be the conductor in a symphony of destruction!</p><p>Game Play:<br/>- \"Grab\" the planet with both hands, and pivot it as though it were suspended on a string connecting your hands.<br/>- Position your rocket launcher under the shadows of incoming asteroids and it will fire automatically.<br/>- The planet will be destroyed after 5 asteroid impacts (shown by the red meter on the top/left of the screen).<br/>- After the game ends, press 'R' to play again.</p><p>Notes:<br/>- Games pauses automatically if the Leap Motion doesn't see valid left and right hands.<br/>- A good starting position is to hold your hands angled about 45 degrees up, positioned 8\" apart and above the sensor.<br/>- The \"remaining enemies\" counter on the top/right of the screen has not been implemented (it simply counts down 200 kills, which IS possible to reach :)<br/>- Press ESC to quit the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/053/05387390ca7612b6bf99f2d4a114a212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Backward_pieS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
