When the game starts, you will find yourself on a small platform with three other players. Push them into the water before they push you off!</p>\r\nObjective of the game\r\n<p>Push is a really simple game. The objective of the game is to push the other players into the ocean as often as you can, but be aware, they will also try to push you off!</p>\r\nControl scheme\r\n<p>This game can either be played solo, or with a friend. Please use the keyboard to play the game. Perhaps you can get the controller working, but the game has not been designed with a controller in mind.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Player One (green pawn)<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move using \"A\" and \"S\".</li><li>Jump with \"W\" (press again to double-jump and / or hold to jump higher).</li><li>Punch with F.</li><li>Headbutt by pressing G.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Player Two (orange pawn)<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move using \"J\" and \"L\".</li><li>Jump with \"I\" (press again to double-jump and / or hold to jump higher).</li><li>Punch with \";\".</li><li>Headbutt by pressing apostrophe.</li></ul>\r\nThird party resources\r\n<ul><li>Asset Forge (western level mesh)</li><li>Bosca Ceoil (annoying background music)</li></ul>\r\nSound effects from Free Sound:\r\n<p>=== Punch Sounds ===<br/>Source: https://freesound.org/s/98341/<br/>Creator: CGEffex<br/>Name: 98341__cgeffex__punch-slap-n-kick.wav<br/>Licence: CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>=== Pain Sounds ===<br/>Source: https://freesound.org/s/44430/<br/>Creator: TheCheeseMan<br/>Name: 44430__thecheeseman__hurt3.wav<br/>Licence: CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>Source: https://freesound.org/s/416838/<br/>Creator: AlineAudio<br/>Name: 416838__alineaudio__grunt2-death-pain.wav<br/>Licence: CC0 1.0</p>\n<p>Source: https://freesound.org/s/416839/<br/>Creator: AlineAudio<br/>Name: 416839__alineaudio__grunt1-death-pain.wav<br/>Licence: CC0 1.0</p>\n<p>Source: https://freesound.org/s/330748/<br/>Creator: barker852<br/>Name: 330748__barker852__pain-1.wav<br/>Licence: CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>=== Water Sounds ===<br/>Source: https://freesound.org/s/352102/<br/>Creator: InspectorJ<br/>Name: 352102__inspectorj__splash-jumping-h.wav<br/>Licence: CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>Source: https://freesound.org/s/9508/<br/>Creator: Petenice<br/>Name: 9508__petenice__splash.wav<br/>Licence: CC0 1.0</p>\n<p>Source: https://freesound.org/s/269271/<br/>Creator: Blukotek<br/>Name: 269271__blukotek__water-splash.wav<br/>Licence: CC0 1.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4ebc00728cb355d3360dcb55d668b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tntmeijs"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
