It's the first video game I've made. I\u00a0had to make it in a time-crunch of 10 days give or take, due to irl circumstances. The game in its current state has about the flavor of an Excel spreadsheet, but with all the above in mind, I'm very happy with the outcome! I enjoyed every step of the process, so much so that I\u00a0will most likely come back to this shortly and add stuff like actual visuals besides monochromatic rectangles, animations, sounds and all that stuff.</p><p>Rules:</p><p>At the start of your turn, draw a card. You may play a card on the board if one of three criteria are met. a)It's a 2 card (regardless of suit) b)The card's suit is the same as the last card's on the board c)the card's value is the same as the last card's on the board. After playing your card, the turn is passed on.</p><p>If within a streak of cards of the same suit on the board, a sequence of more than three cards with consecutive values appears (regardless of proximity within the streak), those cards are removed from the board and \"scored\" by the player who last played a card. Each card \"scored\" contributes to 1 point in your final score, unless it's a Gambit card. At the start of your turn, you are dealt a 2 card. That card's suit is your Gambit suit, and every card in that suit is a Gambit card for you. Every Gambit card you've scored or held in your hand by the end of the game contributes 2 points to the final score.<br/></p><p>The game ends when the deck of 52 cards is empty. Win by scoring more points than the opponent!</p><p>Credits and Attributions:<br/></p><p>Game made by Vangelis Karavidas</p><p>Card art by\u00a0Byron Knoll: http://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/</p><p>Card back \"art\"\u00a0made in MS Paint by Vangelis Karavidas</p><p>Font used is \"Sora\"\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sora?sidebar.open=true&amp;selection.family=Sora:wght@500#abou<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb68c2b8d06fcc0383014c04bb4c3b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gielderien"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
