First is the Full Layout scene, which shows at least four\u00a0examples of each shader as materials on simple meshes. Second is the fly-through scene, which is the application of one specific shader expanded further than walking controls allow, and is a scene of infinite cubes. Lastly is the showcase scene; in this area, there are a few examples of most of the shaders on more complicated models to best show the full effect of each.</p>\n<p>This project was undertaken over about six weeks part-time and includes eleven custom shaders, three environments, and five custom models.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6690de9f5dd2fca4b20c56b019cb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kamenjimu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
