The game was developed by Argonaut Games and published by Virgin Interactive. The game was later ported to the Philips CD-i, Sega Saturn and PlayStation video game systems. A Jaguar CD port was being made by Argonaut Games, but it was cancelled.</p>\n<p>The title was one of the first extensive CD-ROM titles and used full-motion video for both cutscene and interactive portions. As a result, the game spans over a gigabyte in size and over two discs. Gameplay is divided into two portions: an on-rails shoot 'em up portion in which the player pilots a ship through various pre-rendered environments and an adventure-style first-person action portion where players chose between track-based paths at various nodes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd455533e8f834569f39cbcc0d12779f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "3DO", "PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Argonaut Games", "Interactive Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Interactive Entertainment", "Data East"], "esrb_rating": null}
