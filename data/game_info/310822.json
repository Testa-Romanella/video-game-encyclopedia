We learn to type from an early age, but it is boring and few people can stick to it. Many people go to work and find that the speed is too slow and inefficient! The Internet, the Internet of Things, robotics, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics will be the subject of the future, and these themes are inseparable from a solid foundation. Although voice input has become a popular choice for the public, work research still revolves around the keyboard! I hope to bring fun to everyone in the process of learning, so that everyone can enhance their ability in the invisible! This is a long-term personal project. It is my original intention to make a meaningful game! Only when everyone has a better and cheaper option will I stop! I hope that the game will bring happiness to people while growing together! The game is temporarily divided into 4 mini games now.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first game is a gold coin collecting game that people who don't know the letters and have not touched the keyboard can play. As long as you move your finger and follow the gestures in the game, you will be familiar with the feeling of keyboard tapping.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe second game is a special training air combat game. While playing the game here, you can fully train your fingers, and as the difficulty and content advance, you will slowly become a master of typing and a hero of sky.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe third game is a strategy game based on a keyboard combined with typing. I hope that everyone can play different fun through the keyboard. Consolidate your previous efforts. In this game you will be a commander of World War II.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fourth thing I want to do is to make more meaningful things, that is, English words memory and learning, not only to play words, but also to add memory training content. Let everyone have a better English learning tool.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u00a0I like games, so I will add some more interesting ways to attract everyone to complete this keyboard typing training. This basic ability that everyone ignores will be the cultivation that every future human must complete!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInitially I just wanted to give kids a fun typing game to help them practice, but if this is interesting, I hope to help more people.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/6332be1ced70c3c9fcd45850dd3b55a2.jpg", "website": "https://weibo.com/u/1733412480", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Space Ring"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Space Ring"], "esrb_rating": null}
