Paresis is meant to be played this way.</strong><br/><br/><strong>*Headphones are crucial for beating some of the harder phases within Paresis's endgame.</strong><br/><br/>Paresis takes place within a small house in the middle of nowhere. Here you will be faced with numerous challenges. In Paresis you are completely surrounded by 4 rooms. These rooms will unlock throughout each phase and will have a new unique enemy you must encounter. In Paresis these enemies are called Morphs and they have their own positives and negatives. For example, one may be faster then another but they will have fewer hiding spots. On the other hand, you, the player, have<strong> zero movement</strong> and must use your <strong>lean</strong> and <strong>flame energy</strong> to survive the phase. <br/><br/>Each phase within Paresis takes 5 minutes. However, each phase will become harder and you must undergo new obstacles. Once you complete a phase you will be able to make a choice between faster leaning speeds, or extra energy. Flame energy will scare away the Morphs and leaning helps you locate certain areas. Paresis has plenty of lore for those interested in the game's story. If you beat a phase, you will be able to listen to radios that can help you understand more of the game's secrets. These radios are extremely important to the game's overall plot. Although, there are plenty of little <strong>easter eggs</strong> hidden about that also carry more of the game's overarching narrative. However, some things are better left unsaid. <br/><br/>Lastly, Paresis is a very challenging game once you reach some of the ending phases. This will test your listening, logic, and timing skills. In order to beat these phases, you will have to dig deep and figure out what is the best strategy moving forward. Whether that is picking certain rooms to check at specific times or making sure you pick the right combination of lean and energy in order to survive. <br/><br/>Enter at your own risk!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T04:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e547577067ac9bb7f84f00aff7558c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HEAD GMZ"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HEAD GMZ"], "esrb_rating": null}
