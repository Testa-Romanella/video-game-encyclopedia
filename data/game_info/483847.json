Tell the game where you'd like to place the piece, and it will try to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Control the target placement by moving your mouse, or with W A S D, or with arrow keys. Rotate the target placement with mouse scroll or Q E or [ ]. Place at current piece location with mouse click, Space or Enter.</p>\n<p>If you lose the game, it might crash, but hopefully you will not lose.
