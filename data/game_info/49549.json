So, on some levels you might need to navigate through some asteroid or gravity fields, while on others you might have to transfer passengers between stations.<br/>Or my favourite one! Build a ship to capture and deliver some satellites.The ship's structureIn this game, the ships are not the usual boring rigid machineries. They have some flexibility, so you might want to design your ship to achieve some structural integrity, because you can easily lose a part of the ship if you don't make sure that enough stabilization has been built in it.<br/>For further fun, the game has servos and splitters so you can build shape shifting ships, too.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Energy systemIn this game energy is everything. You do not need any fuel or ammunition, but you need to place batteries and power plants into your ships. Make sure that they are carefully placed because if you lose a module, you will lose the its capability.<br/>For example, shields are one of the hungriest energy modules in the game right now, but don't worry, you can turn them on and off, one by one. <br/>This way you can pump all your energy into the front shield if you don't need to worry about your back.Time controlProbably everyone would want to control time. In this game, you can change the speed of passing time as you like. <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cc3ca496c2b06eb04b0681a5e33d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NanoidGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NanoidGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
