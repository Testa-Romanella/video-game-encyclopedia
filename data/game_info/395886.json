All the sprite, artwork, music are made by me. If you played the game please give feedback on what i should improve, as this is my first project i know it is not that good. So i will try to take your feedback as much as possible and implement it on my next project.\u00a0<br/>The basic premise of the game is stomping on enemies and killing them. I was inspired by the stomping mechanics of mario so i wanted to implement that on my own game.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>A or D or ARROW KEYS TO MOVE LEFT or RIGHT<br/>SPACE TO JUMP</p>\n<p>KILL ALL ENEMIES AND COLLECT ALL GEMS TO GO TO NEXT LEVEL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:36:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825bfabdc27ef0db66d2521bbb5662e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xneco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
