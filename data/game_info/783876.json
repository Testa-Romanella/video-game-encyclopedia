White is for quest for spirit, red for competition and blue for fly race.<br/>On the left-hand side you can change the degree of difficulty; blue is easy and black is hard. By grabbing the sphere, we can activate or deactivate the special modus.<br/>On the right-hand side players can be added or removed (max. is 5) and team assignment can be done (max. 5 teams are possible). We are always player one; the other characters will be randomized but determined by the team setup.<br/><br/><br/>Next to the statistic you can choose a level by grabbing one of the boxes on the counter \u2013 the level will start after you release your choice.<br/><br/>In main menu we initially can\u2019t fly until we visit the question mark (introductions) at the shrine gate.<br/><br/>Optional, manually reset/adjust camera view via pushing the left menu button.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Game variants:</strong><br/>In <strong>quest for spirit</strong> \u2013 we can search for spirits, try to find as many as possible. They are partly or completely hidden by obstacles. Remove obstacles with your sword or fly through them.<br/>If all spirits have been found the level is over.<br/><br/>In <strong>competition </strong>everyone has HP points. A character is KO if HP points equals 0; then this character will fly into the five-sided figure on the ground.<br/>Level is finished once either all opponents have passed the gate, or your HP is 0. Level could also be finished if you found and toggled three switchers and fly into the five-sided figure in the sky.<br/><br/>In <strong>fly race</strong> \u2013 we should try to fly through as many check points as possible.<br/>The start and end checkpoint are flagged with an icon.<br/>To finish this mode, start with the arrow check point and complete by the check point with the checkered flag.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Flying &amp; walking:</strong><br/>To fly - put both hands up.<br/>The direction of the flight is determined by the head movement.<br/>Faster rotations will be done via left or right grip button.<br/>To fly faster \u2013 put hands forward; interrupt flying via trigger button.<br/>On platforms we can walk by teleporting.
