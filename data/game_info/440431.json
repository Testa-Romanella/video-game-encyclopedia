In <em>Monolithic</em> you guide a pantheon of gods, and humanity itself, through time, from the dawn of creation to the fires of the apocalypse. Raise your civilization from the sand, build your forces, and grow your influence over humanity. Siege enemy settlements with vast armies and break their monoliths with devastating abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The power of the gods is at your command in the multiplayer, real-time strategy game <em>Monolithic</em>. At the beginning of the match, each player selects three gods from a pantheon, each with three unique abilities. Different combinations of gods open new play styles and strategies that the player can experiment with. The players start the match with their selected monoliths and a small cult of followers. <em>Monolithic </em>emphasises strategy over fast reflexes. As centuries pass both players methodically grow their civilizations and use their abilities to gain the upper hand. The game is won through proper use of devotion, cities, and time. The monoliths gather devotion from their followers to power their abilities. These abilities can shape the world around the monoliths, influence humanity, or deal damage to humanity and monolith alike. However, all beginnings must have endings. The world and its inhabitants are fragile compared to the power of the gods, and their war will bring the world to its end. A god is powerless without devotion from its followers, but even the end of the world can be leveraged with the right strategy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/6952d8296a01db387259a2be6383f727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fowl Machinations"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
