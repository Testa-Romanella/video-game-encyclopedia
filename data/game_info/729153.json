Oh no?\u00a0It is not that complicated, let me guide you through it...\u00a0First of all, you need to know that <strong>Pet Sanctuary</strong> is a\u00a0place to shelter animals found in <strong>danger zones</strong>, so take\u00a0extra care of them! And how to do so? Good question! It is\u00a0simple: you collect <strong>woods</strong> in the front yard, then go back\u00a0to the building and use the <strong>Resource Trader Machine</strong> to\u00a0sell wood and buy <strong>food</strong>, <strong>soaps</strong> and <strong>toys</strong>. Give those\u00a0supplies to the animals in order to keep them <strong>satisfied</strong>.\u00a0Feel that you can afford more animals? Awesome! Just head back\u00a0to the building and use the <strong>Animal Creator Machine</strong> to do so.\u00a0Pretty simple, hum? Hope you like it and good game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Comments</strong></p>\n<p>The game was our entry for the 17-day Virtual Pet Jam 2022 which\u00a0used the prompt \"In the Zone\" as the sub-theme.
