But you can also play it here on itch.io now!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Open world with unique zones to explore</li><li>MMO: Online multiplayer</li><li>Monsters: Hunt, battle, and catch many unique monsters!</li><li>Crafting: Collect different resources and use them to craft items &amp; consumables</li><li>Language Learning: Unlock vocabulary cards!</li><li>Currently 4 vocabulary languages to choose from: Chinese, German, Japanese, Russian</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong>O\ufeff</strong>verview:</strong></p>\n<p>In\u00a0Vocab RPG, you have all the elements of a monster-focused RPG: Hunting, fighting, catching, leveling, crafting, etc. But for every action that you take in the game, it will show you a vocabulary card! As a consequence, the more words you know, the stronger you also become in the game.</p>\n<p>The game starts very slowly with only 3 words unlocked. But as you progress in the game, you can unlock more cards and expand your vocabulary - at your own pace.\ufeff</p>\n\n<p><strong>Difficulties:</strong></p>\n<p>To take into account different learning preferences, you can pick your challenge by choosing from 4 difficulty settings:</p>\n<ul><li>Normal: Wrong answers reduce your monster's attack or consumables (such as potions) by 25%.</li><li>Casual: Even if you answer wrong, you will attack and operate at 100% effectiveness. In other words, you see the cards but there is no consequence for answering wrong.</li><li>Hardcore: When you answer wrong, your monster's attack will fail! So answering wrong means 0 damage dealt.\ufeff</li><li>\u00a0Off: I also want people to enjoy this game, even when they are not really in the mood for studying vocabulary cards right now.... select 'Off' and you will not see any vocabulary cards in the game!\ufeff</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Platform:</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to the power of\u00a0Phaser 3, you can play this game on any device in your browser. No installation required.</p>\n<p>The game is mobile optimized, so whether you play on your laptop or phone / tablet, is only a matter of your preference.\ufeff\ufeff</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Link:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in playing the game, you can jump right into it!\u00a0Play directly here on itch.io or you can also play it on my website BrowserGamesHub.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated!
