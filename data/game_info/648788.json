Shortly after\u00a0the pandemic and lockdown began. I\u00a0wasn't able to pinpoint what I felt exactly; everything felt surreal. It was\u00a0 a mess, out of control. Toilet paper was running out in the supermarket, misinformation was everywhere and people were panicking. Could you have imagined such a thing before 2020? People were shut up at home, shops closed down, some temporarily, some for good. The streets were quiet for a while, with people out only for their necessary shopping and apparently church (???). At first people didn\u2019t take it seriously, got caught out and fined for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Seeing how world governments were mishandling the situation, the spreading sense of dread, the growing backlash and developing conspiracy theories, it was clear that this would be for the long haul. Unable to have fun outside, to engage with people actively and socially, I instead spent a year learning to make a game from scratch. With some help from my partner\u00a0and my friends, it's finally done!</p>\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Romain Gauthier for the awesome BG Music\u00a0<br/>Andrew K.
