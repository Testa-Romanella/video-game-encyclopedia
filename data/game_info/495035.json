You have a futile mission, but your programming demands that you survive as long as possible, despite your visual systems already beginning to fail you.</p>\n<p>Click to shoot your grapple hook, and click again to retract it once it is launched</p>\n<p>The buzzing sound is intentional, and is meant to be used to locate which black-hole you are closer too, and therefore heading towards. Don't ask why the black-holes are constantly emitting orange and blue brick walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art-pack made by Kenny</p>\n<p>Font-pack from\u00a0https://managore.itch.io/m3x6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/29405f0d7ca1f3f948589782dd07c370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Koaliver"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
