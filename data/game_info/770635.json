He's excited to play the game and have fun. This game demo features one full level with coins to collect, enemies to squash, and a building to reach in order to end the game. All game assets are custom made as a call-back to classic platformer games, while also keeping a black and white aesthetic, which matches Pouchie's theme (pronounced P-oo-ch-ee), as he was originally inspired by the old Black and White cartoons, popularized by Fleischer Studios and that other one.</p>\n<p>Currently, the game doesn't feature a soundtrack, but assuming public reception of this game is positive, I intend to work on turning this small project into a full game with multiple levels, music, bosses, and a story.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you enjoy this small project of mine!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T13:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/402fa5706509ee4d2fe8b2059d59baf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThatElfNerd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
