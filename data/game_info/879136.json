The main goal is to endure against hordes of enemies (Ytech staff members) in\u00a0an endless run. There are two entities that influence the controls: one changes the\u00a0speed of the ball, and the other increases the radius of the circular movement.\u00a0</p><p>I invite you to downlaod (it only takes 5 seconds) and beat my highscore of 1min32secs.
