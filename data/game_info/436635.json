Combining crisp three-dimensional graphics with the power of voice, Tetrivoice breaks the physical barrier between you and the game. No longer are you restrained to your human bodies and slow physical reaction times. Now you can tell your game exactly what you want it to do. <br/></p>\n<p>As the brilliant yet humble creator of Tetrivoice I am graciously giving away this game and the source code free of cost. While I could make millions of dollars if I were to merchandise it, I believe that it is imperative that the public have access to this powerful, landscape changing piece of technology. Please use responsibly; I cannot and will not be held accountable for any negative or positive effects this technology has on you or your equipment (no matter how vast of a fortune one stands to gain).</p>\n<p>-------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Chrome works best and is the only browser supported by default.
