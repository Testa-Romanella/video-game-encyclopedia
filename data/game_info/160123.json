Also the evolution of \u201cmankind\u201d is presented in several levels: you\u2019ll see all kinds of art and scientific inventions throughout history, but also periods to be less proud of like slavery and war. At the end you help planet Cube through difficult stages like a rising sea level, tornedo\u2019s and cities in smog.\r\n  \r\n\u00a0 \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt\u00a0sounds like a lot, but\u00a0it\u2019s a puzzle game so everything is presented using only a few cubes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPlanet Cube has a final surprise for you after you passed all 38 levels. By that time you have proved to be an excellent \u201cplanet saver\u201d so you get the choice to \u201csave planet Earth\u201d...
