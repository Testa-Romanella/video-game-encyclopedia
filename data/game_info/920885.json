Explore the parallel society of root vegetables, fruits and mushrooms, where each faction holds unique strengths and powers. With Sir Elderadish as your guide, discover the backstory of the root vegetable faction, historically the smallest and weakest of them all. Join the journey and fight for the rights of root vegetables in this exciting and thought-provoking farming-autobattle adventure.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the game \"The living garden: Rise of the root vegetables\" is to beat as many rounds of enemy waves as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To acquire your root vegetable as units, you have to select the seeds you want and plant it into one of nine fields.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To enhance the growth and quality of your vegetables, make sure to use fertilizers. Apply them before you seed the field to see the best results. There are three different types of fertilizers: the Star-Ilizer raises the stats of the finished vegetable, the Irri-Ilizer gives you a 50% chance that the field stays watered, and the Speed-Ilizer reduces the time until the vegetable is fully grown (Star-Ilizer is not implemented yet).</p>\n<p>When you finished fertilizing, planting and watering your vegetables, click on the Calendar-Icon on the bottom right to proceed to the next day. After every ten days, a battle between your root vegetable units and enemy units will happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Continue to grow and place your army, and take on tougher and an increasing numbers of opponents as you progress. Once all your vegetables are defeated, you have to start the game all over again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Team behind \"The Living Garden: Rise of the Root Vegetables\"</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Anja Kortmann - Lead Artist-\u00a0https://dreamless-ghost.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Kevin Hoxha - Artist -\u00a0https://kevkev7557.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Jonas Kling- Lead Developer -\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This Game is an early release\u00a0and </em><em>was created during the Global Game Jam 2023</em></p>\n\n<p> All images are copyrighted \u00a9 by Kevin Hoxha, Anja Kortmann und Jonas Kling.
