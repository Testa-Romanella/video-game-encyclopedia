In the game, players take control of the title character Jinborov Karnovski (\u30b8\u30f3\u30dc\u30ed\u30d5\u30fb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc), or \"Karnov\" for short. Karnov is a strongman popularly illustrated as being from an unspecified part of the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics as shown on the arcade flyer and again in Karnov's Revenge.</p>\n<p>As a character created by Data East, Karnov was reintroduced in several other games from the company, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he is a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in the 1994 Neo-Geo game Karnov's Revenge. This game, also known as Fighter's History Dynamite, is not a sequel to the original Karnov, but to Fighter's History, a competitive one-on-one fighter in which Karnov is the final boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/765f5b0640d1049558d0a8cc769ba227.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 9, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 400, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Classic Macintosh", "NES"], "developers": ["Data East", "Technology Works"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco", "Data East"], "esrb_rating": null}
