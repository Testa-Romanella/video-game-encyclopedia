Upon arriving, she quickly realized that weeds have grown on similar soils and have evolved into Weedlings. These snake-like creatures are spreading everywhere possible! The florist must\u00a0team up with her newfound turnip friends\u00a0to stop the Weedlings from taking over the soil.</p>\n\n<p><strong>// Controls --&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>This game uses only the mouse.</p>\n<p>Use the right mouse button to move.</p>\n<p>Click on soil to plant a seed. Once fully\u00a0grown, click again to pull Turnpup. <strong>Soils that have been filled with weeds cannot be used or recovered.</strong></p>\n<p>Click on the grass to place a Turnpup. They will attack all Weedlings in the given area.</p>\n<p>Return a Turnpup to your bag by clicking on them. Beware - if the Turnpup is not at full HP, it will return as a seed.<br/></p>\n<p>Click a Weedling once to attack it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a Weedling will drop a seed. Don't forget to\u00a0click the seed to pick it up!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/190/1906f155d6cc0b90dfa1c2161ad717ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dmDash"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
