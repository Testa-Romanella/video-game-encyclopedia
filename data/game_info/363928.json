The exposed deadly gas has rendered the majority of the Earth uninhabitable. Those that weren't lucky enough to make it on to one\u00a0of the Nomad Initiative's ships\u00a0were driven mad by the gas. It seems that luck wasn't on the side of Madison, Fardin, Zonta and Serrana either. Their ship failed to make it out of the Earth's orbit and crashed back down on the surface. Now they have 30 days to find a way to survive before the gas infects them too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Customise your team of diverse survivors to manage the games environment in different ways, and consider what to build and collect carefully before you run out of the vital elements you need to survive...</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Team:</p>\n<ul><li>Max Quelch-Woolls (Producer)</li><li>Jake Denton (Programmer)</li><li>Leon Brown (Designer &amp; Writer)</li><li>Holly Bridges (Designer &amp; Artist)</li><li>Hannah Kay (Artist)</li><li>Mauro Caspanello (Music &amp; SFX)</li><li>Ellis Devereux (Studio Manager &amp; Marketing)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/5645e385c5aea91fd8c86e9b83bc43ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octopus 8 Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
