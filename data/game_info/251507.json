{"id": 251507, "slug": "achtung-die-kugel-2", "name": "Achtung die Kugel!", "name_original": "Achtung die Kugel!", "description": "A local multiplayer action game where skills and tactics decide who wins.<br/>Each player controls of a \"kurve\", a curve that always moves forward and is only stopped when crashing into another object. Whenever an opponent crashes while you're still in the game, you score a point. Get to the score limit first to win the game!<br/><br/>Achtung die Kugel re-imagines the old classic \"Achtung die Kurve\". Achtung die Kugel bends achtung-space to kugel-space (sphere-space) and brings the same classic action and skillful gameplay you would expect from an achtung game.<br/><br/><br/>Here's what's in the package:<br/><br/>- <strong>Action packed gameplay</strong>: one small mistake and you're out for the round!<br/><br/>- Achtung die Kugel is played on a <strong>Sphere!!</strong><br/><br/>- <strong>Jumps!</strong> Get out of tight situations or get right in front of an opponent with this skill-intensive feature.<br/><br/>- <strong>Easy to learn - hard to master</strong>: you can only go left, right or jump. But it takes lots of skill and tactics if you want to win the round!<br/><br/>- Play <strong>up to 4 players</strong> in two teams or free for all.<br/><br/>- Different <strong>maps</strong> to choose from.<br/><br/>- <strong>Xbox controller support</strong>. Definitely plays best with controllers!<br/><br/>- <strong>Party mode</strong>. Hate waiting for the end of each round? In party mode you respawn immediately!<br/><br/>- Many <strong>settings</strong> for your ultimate achtung-on-a-sphere experience!<br/><br/><br/><br/>We really hope you like it!<br/>Konec hry!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7ce93783789420964fbd8d2ec16d9f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fredrik Carlsson", "Erik Sill\u00e9n", "Philip Bretschneider"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
