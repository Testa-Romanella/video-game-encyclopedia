{"id": 9502, "slug": "tower-57", "name": "Tower 57", "name_original": "Tower 57", "description": "<strong>The tower awaits.</strong><br/><br/>In a dystopian, dieselpunk world, where Megatowers are the only enclaves of civilization, a group of extraordinary individuals is sent to infiltrate the reclusive Tower 57. Their skills, clips' capacity &amp; the ability to cooperate will decide on their fate.<br/><br/>Tower 57 is a top-down twin stick shooter with 16-bit inspired pixel art, destructible environments and heavy focus on co-op. It is also a modern take on what made AMIGA games so great back in the days.<strong>FAST-PACED ARCADE GAMEPLAY</strong><br/><br/>There is no school like the old school. <strong>Shoot everything that moves and don\u2019t get killed in the process</strong>. Tower 57 offers complex situations arising from simple systems interacting with each other - and it does it the hard way. Number of lives is scarce, respawns limited and difficulty skyrockets when you least expect it.<strong>TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION</strong> <br/>Choose from a roster of <strong>six particular characters with different skillsets, number of upgradable weapons and gadgets</strong>. And if you happen to lose an arm or leg during your mission - you can always replace it with a new, better one! Master these combos and you will never get bored on your way to the top of the Tower 57.<strong>COOPERATION</strong><br/>Mayhem tastes the best when it is shared. Tower 57's main campaign is designed for both, <strong>single player &amp; local/online co-op</strong>. Flank your enemies, bait them into an ambush, leverage co-op specific weapons, or combine your regular weapons for increased firepower and new effects!<strong>DIESELPUNK WORLD</strong> <br/>Find your way through a maze of floors connected by elevators, a central hub filled with shops and terminals, and a multitude of secret walls and uncharted passageways leading to forgotten parts of the tower. Times of randomly generated levels are gone - <strong>everything in Tower 57 is carefully designed and pixel-crafted with the highest attention to detail</strong>.<strong>DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS</strong> <br/>Smash them, crash them and destroy everything. Reload. Repeat. Because <strong>everyone likes when things go BOOM</strong>. Everything - from debris and shell casings to bloody footprints - will mark your destructive trail through the Tower.<strong>ADVERSARIES</strong> <br/>Each enemy features its own distinct spawning mechanism, movement &amp; attack patterns, as well as some weaknesses. And you'd better <strong>learn those vulnerabilities if you don't want to end up dead very quick</strong>.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-10T20:56:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e0bed150fdd09bc7a0471f245628827.jpg", "website": "http://tower57game.com/", "rating": 3.24, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 610, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 23, "suggestions_count": 497, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixwerk"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["11 bit studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
