Every few moves an immovable block will be dropped onto the playfield. Immovable blocks can only be destroyed by matching them to one another\u00a0(which is tricky as they can't be swapped!) or by matching more than three shapes in a row.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Matching four shapes in a row destroys a full row or column - including immovable blocks. Matching in a \"T\" shape destroys the row and column together!</p>\n<p>Matching five in a\u00a0row destroys all similar shapes on the game board and gives an extra shuffle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When there are no valid moves left the playfield is shuffled - and when you have\u00a0no shuffles left the game is over!\r\n</p>\n<p>How many matches can you make before running out of moves?</p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to move, click and drag to swap shapes</li><li>There are several game modes:\u00a0Casual mode has few immovable blocks; Classic is the original C64 game with immovable blocks gradually being dropped until you can make no more moves;\u00a0Shopping sees you attempting to match the number of shapes shown on the left of the screen; and in Count Down you must make matches against the clock.</li><li>Press the right mouse button or on-screen\u00a0\"Hint\" button\u00a0for a hint if you get stuck\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Coding, graphics and sound by Mike Richmond</p>\n<p>Title Screen by Andy Cashmore</p>\n<p>My thanks go out to:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Hi7ch, Shaun Watters and Mr Kola for play testing\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:51:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e98434580bc5d30cdafd91a0097d096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeRichmond"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
