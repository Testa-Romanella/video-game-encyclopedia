In this game, I\r\ndecided to use Unity 2019.3, which at the time of writing was still\r\nin beta. I experimented with a few new features, like URP and its 2D\r\nlighting and post-processing.</p>\n<p>I\r\nam very happy with the result, and I learn a lot from making this\r\ngame. However, I want to add some more features, but due to time\r\nconstraints, I decided to settle with this version, and save the\r\nother stuff for next month.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/><br/>Defend\r\nthe youngins against the never-ending wave of vicious monsters.
