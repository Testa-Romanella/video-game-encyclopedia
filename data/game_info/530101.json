What would you do?</p>\n<p>Game goal is to create life.\u00a0More\u00a0importantly\u00a0-\u00a0intelligent\u00a0life!\u00a0As\u00a0a\u00a0greater\u00a0being\u00a0you\u00a0can manipulate basic\u00a0particles contributing them properly to planets to create perfect life conditions. You win the game, when there are more than 100 humans for some amount of cycles.</p>\n<p># How to play</p>\n<ol><li>Collect solid resources from flying asteroids</li><li>Apply collected resources to potential planets</li><li>Monitor planet stats and apply resources accordingly.</li><li>Every cycle planet stats and resources are converted<br/>Example: If planet temperature is between 300 and 99999 and this cycle planet has generated at least 100 energy, than for every 100 energy left\u00a02 Dirt/Rock and 2 minerals will be converted to 3 Breathable gases and 1 Other gas.</li><li>Depending on multiple parameters one set of resources can became another.</li><li>The more perfect conditions - the higher is change to spawn life.</li></ol>\n<p>Planet temperature is different every other cycle, but in range of min. max. possible planet temperatures. Life spawns best around 200 - 400 Kelvin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every time life spawns - it also produces pure essence on a planet which increases chances to spawn life next.</p>\n<p>In bad environment conditions life can start dying. That gives player dark matter and transfers some pure essence to players inventory. Later essence can be used to manually boost spawn change or even force life to spawn (not available yet).</p>\n<p>There is a crafting recipes list that show all the possible conditions and combinations.<br/></p>\n<p>Planet resources and how they work (formulas are work in progress):<br/></p>\r\nDistance to star<br/>affects maximum and minimum planet temperaturesAtmosphere<br/>Contains of gases. Greenhouse gases trap heat increasing minimum temperature. Other gases reflect heat decreasing maximum temperature<br/>Planet rotation speed<br/>The faster planet rotates - the more balanced temperatures will be. At maximum speed max. and min. temperatures should be equal. Speed mostly depends on solid heavy resources (their ratio)<br/>Basic resources<br/>dirt and minerals mostly are used to produce breathable and other gases. Also, they are used as food for life.<br/>\n<p>Assets were mostly taken from itch.io and them modified:</p>\n<ul><li>https://deep-fold.itch.io/pixel-planet-generator\u00a0- great tool. sadly allows only png extraction. Later need something like that to be built in game</li><li>\u00a0https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/space - pixel art space backgrounds. Some of them even are animated</li><li>https://karwisch.itch.io/pxui-basic - mostly were used as a template and modified using paint.net</li><li>https://helianthus-games.itch.io/pixel-art-planets\u00a0- provide 4 basic planets for free. (small ones in game). Not what I wanted at start, but\u00a0now think I should have gone only with them and just modify them in-game, like scale, tint etc.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0d49c675a930a1f4d232d69438bafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DinoCrys"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
