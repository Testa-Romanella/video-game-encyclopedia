After one failed and two finishing attempts at TriJam (make a game in three hours), I wanted to a longer format one. Since I have Extra Credits to thank for keeping my intereseting in game development alive over all these years, I thought it only fitting to participate in theirs.</p>\n<p>Cycle Trial (or Trial Cycle?) tries to belong to the #Cycles theme of EC's Game Jam 3 in two ways: it features a bike (or bi-cycle) and if you die or hit the recycle signs, the game resets you to the beginning of the level.</p>\n<p>This game was made using Godot, the open-source and free engine; Clip Studio and GIMP for images; Audacity for converting the royalty-free tracks of Kevin MacLeod (internet\u00a0\u00a0music hero) to ogg format.</p>\n<p>Trial Cycle or Cycle Trial?
