Obviously this game doesn't relate to the theme, because the hotel is very large and has many, many rooms and there isn't anything suspicious going on whatsoever, why - did someone ask about it?<br/>Err, anyway - hope you have fun giving my game a try!<br/><br/>This time I truly did everything by myself (including the music - yikes), so this was quite an undertaking for me!<br/>I wasn't able to finish <em>everything </em>that I wanted to, but I think I have a pretty fun version of the game idea I had in my mind, so that's gotta count for something, huh?<br/><br/>Let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:00:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/072fc1517302a3d04694e091a0b3bee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shovel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
