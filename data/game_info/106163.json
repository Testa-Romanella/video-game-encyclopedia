The theme was \"connected worlds.\" You can see the original submission and comments here, and the full source is available on GitHub. The original description is below.</p>\n<p>Enter the mysterious world of a book of old fairy tales. The book is worn, and some stories have fallen apart into others! Help Sir Knight the Magnificent finish his story by helping others.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD, and left mouse button to toggle zoom (important!)</p>\n<p>It's far from finished, so expect some bugs. Pay attention to the text and illustrations to get an idea of what to do.</p>\n<p>The name uses a number of assets from OpenGameArt.org.
