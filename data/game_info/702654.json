This game is an upcoming side-scrolling platformer that takes significant (dare I say <em>blatant</em>) influence from the very early first-party Famicom/NES titles, which are better known as the \"black box\" series of games. Join AISU THE PENGUIN on her quest to eat as many tasty frozen treats as possible while also enjoying a healthy pescatarian diet of salmon along the way. Bop enemies, dodge obstacles, and get to the end. It's that simple!<br/> This demo consists of the first world in its entirety, in a largely final state (changes that are subject to happen mid-development notwithstanding), with a prospective release date of <strong>early 2022</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Isaac Riley:</strong> Creator, Primary Pixel Artist, Composer, Programming, Concept Design, Level Designer, SFX, Bechstein Debauchery<br/>\n</li><li><strong>T.C.
