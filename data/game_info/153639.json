Your energy is represented by the brightness of the white energy ball; the darker it is, the less energy you have. You can gain energy by absorbing energy from the pegs (but you will take damage and lose a point if you directly hit one). Keep your energy high to gain points. And seek out hearts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0df/0df3ef2a25066457fc3c6e8d027173a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Trent Polack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
