Don't miss any of them or they will make thorns grow over your plant.</p>\n\n<p>Use LMB to catch falling water drops.<br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to jump horizontally/vertically between leaves.</p>\n<p>If water drop falls all the way down the thorns will advance. If they advance too far they will kill the frog.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of things I wanted to add but I haven't due to lack of time(had to learn for thesis defence c:) - but I'm just glad that I was able to finish the game, because I often leave projects unfinished. Hope you will enjoy this short game and I would love to receive feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>BFXR - Software for generating sounds</p>\n<p>Poupi's incredible adventures (full album) | OpenGameArt.org<br/></p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/different-steps-on-wood-stone-leaves-gravel-and-...</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/sprint-jumpinteraction-sound-yo-frankie</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/crickets-ambient-noise-loopable</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/wind1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/7327b37d50fa4d5f985023b9da42aba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kohan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
