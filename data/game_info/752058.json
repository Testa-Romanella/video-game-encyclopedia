Slash through your enemies as your make your way through each sector of the server, in order to rid the whole system of the virus that has grasped it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA single means of offense: A sword that can slice through enemies, and take their data to power up again!  You only have a single shot!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA challenge, a touch, a termination: A single graze from your enemies will delete you and force you to start each sector over again!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main objective is not the end: Replayability, with either keyboard, or gamepads! Make the most of your time and ability by reaching each sector, and finishing the game in the shortest time possible! Or perhaps, with as many chained combo attacks as possible!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T03:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af181d875194f57b2db75225399f8d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zenberry Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Zenberry Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
