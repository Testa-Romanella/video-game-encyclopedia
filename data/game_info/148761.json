Mostly it's about jumping around and being a cute demon. <br/> <br/>The game's story, which didn't quite make it in is that a little girl summons you to help her. With what? Oh destroy her evil imaginary haunts and kick back and eat berries together. That's the source right there. <br/> <br/>It was my (Jake's) first LD and I had a blast. I plan to continue developing it because I'm happy with the idea and I like the world. So please enjoy it too!</p><p>Ludum Dare page<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131c3f5f7572dcd643738530897c033c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["New Beings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
