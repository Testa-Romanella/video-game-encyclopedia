It's\u00a0a short and sweet text adventure about a little girl at the fair who'll do whatever it takes to ride the Big Roller Coaster. Deal with your overbearing mother; talk to psychics, clowns, and a fat man; and most importantly, ride the Big Coaster!<br/></p><p><strong>Ganbare Buta-Kun</strong>\u00a0was an unlockable in \"Koala Quest\", and makes yet another appearance in the upcoming \"Six Trapped Pets\". The game doesn't hold up on its own, but if it's included in a pack, who can complain!?</p>\n<p><strong>Route 24</strong>\u00a0is a a horrible miserable grueling game about driving through rural Illinois and Indiana. I had recently driven through that region, and making this game was instrumental in soothing my trauma. It plays pretty similar to \"Snail Party\", so if you've played that at all you know what you're in for.</p>\n<p>I made both \"Ganbare Buta-Kun\" and \"Route 24\", but \"Dahlia &amp; The Big Coaster\" was made by KnitSage (her first solo game). She previously worked on \"Koala Quest\" and on translating both \"Avena vs. Moho del Lodo\" and \"Cruzador Quimera: Defensor de Dominicus<strong>\"</strong>. She's been working on \"Alien Biologist\" on-and-off for a while now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T05:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc1eb47fb42f0ad4091fdaa86a0c6f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MansterSoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
