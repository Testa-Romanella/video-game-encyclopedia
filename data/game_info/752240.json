Sephonie will run fine with these resolutions but some UI may be cut off, which you can fix by using the in-game UI Scaling option or by running the game in a 16:9/16:10 windowed resolution.<br/>The same goes for UWHD resolutions in fullscreen.<br/><br/>Sephonie only officially and natively supports certain controllers (PS4/5, XB1/XB360). Other controllers may work with Steam Input, but functionality not guaranteed. In particular the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is NOT supported although players have gotten it working. See forum for details.<br/><br/>Sephonie has been tested to work on Linux with Proton, although there may be some lighting errors depending on your OS so we have chosen to not have an officially supported Linux version.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-04T14:47:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e6675924ad7245529f846d8b3f3c0a.jpg", "website": "https://analgesic.productions/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 34, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 511, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Marina Kittaka", "Melos Han-Tani"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Analgesic Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
