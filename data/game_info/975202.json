Gain power from gathering aura orbs from enemies you defeat. But beware enemies grow stronger with each passing floor.<h3>Features</h3><br/><strong>END THE DREAM LOOP</strong><br/>Stuck in your nightmares filled with demons, you'll have to face challenges on every level, in the span of 5 different rooms, that repeat until you face the room boss. Before the bosses you'll have to fight through their minions first, but the catch is you stay in each room for a longer amount of time each boss you beat, and demons in previous rooms seep into the later ones and mix with the attributes of the room, making them even more challenging to beat.<br/><br/><strong>FACE OFF AGAINST BOSSES WITH UNIQUE ANIMATED EVENTS AND PHASES.</strong><br/>Go through cinematic scenes where you'll has to react in a certain amount of time with accurate button presses. These scenes sometimes differentiate from the normal hack n slash gameplay and give you a different experience as the dream changes and warps because of the bosses actions.<br/><br/><strong>WEILD THE POWER OF ANIME ON YOUR SIDE</strong><br/>Gain many skills from collecting aura gems from enemies you defeat. The higher the level and more dangerous the enemy is the more powerful skills become available to you.<br/><br/><strong>DREAM UP YOUR OWN BUFFS AND ABILITIES</strong><br/>These abilities will randomly become available in the shop or by purchasing another random three every time you pass a level. They vary from stats boost to abilities such as transformations, auto actions regen abilities, stat buffs when successfully preforming certain actions and damage reduction.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T05:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af3f59171eb4684310c894695d8ee531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hollo_Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hollo_Dev"], "esrb_rating": null}
