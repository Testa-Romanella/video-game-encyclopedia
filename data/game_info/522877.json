Beautiful vivid colors and curious shapes, in an unpredictable pattern of motion, can be useful for meditation, to relax, and enhancement of imagination. Accompanied by background music, 18 different tracks, that help to set the mood. After a long stressful day, a few minutes of Kaleidoscope time may help the brain to relieve the stress and tune in into a more peaceful and cheerful state. Kaleidoscope is based on randomness and repetition, just like the nature of human life, that each of us needs to accept, eventually. We might feel not so comfortable because of those forces, but we can learn to embrace and enjoy the results of chance and periodicity. And once in a while for a brief moment, Kaleidoscope of life can create a wonderfully unique and inspirational vision that our mind is longing so much to observe.</p>\n<p>In practice Kaleidoscope 3D is a simulation in the structure and functionality of a virtual Kaleidoscope. Our Kaleidoscope automatically rotates, zooms and moves, but every parameter can be adjusted or canceled. It can be controlled manually by touch gestures. Users may customize the capacity of shapes and the speed in which they are shuffled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaleidoscope comes with a set of shapes and colors, candy-themed, like different candies accompanied by a bright set of complementary material, that the user can enjoy free of charge.
