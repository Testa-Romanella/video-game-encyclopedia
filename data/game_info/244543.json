Made for the Godot Wild Jam but was submitted late due to misreading the deadline time. Basically its a game that evolves as you play it. The dungeon's difficulty and story react to your ability to play the game and luck of the roll as well. The idea is to simulate how the environment changes the player and the player's experience.</p>\n<p>WARNING: You may roll a game where there is no explanation for what to do. This is intentional.<br/></p>\n<p>Download the appropriate executable for your operating system and makes sure the .pck file is in the same folder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da07a2577123059fb3bb9ab4c76c227e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["la_ombrulo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
