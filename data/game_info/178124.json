The theme was \"One Room\" and this was my first try at a 3D game in a jam. The game originally started as a homage to the Apollo computer and associated DSKY system (from reading Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight, an interesting book to read actually about the differing views about the roles of humans in a high tech system). I had also read The Hunt for Red October which influenced my fake country and theme.</p><p>Nobody has play tested this other than me but it is possible to win. Maybe the win logic only makes sense in my twisted mind. I was going to make it so that you could do something you could no longer win (like the games of yore) but I fear that may leave a bad impression. You can insta-lose though which I've always found funny. Some things aren't implemented properly but I'm just glad to get a game that you can finish.</p><p>Music taken from http://www.whatfunk.com/ (<em>shhh... altered by me slightly )</em> and sound effects taken from Sonniss.com - GDC - Game Audio Bundle. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e43a95daf26b30114ad9fbdfb6ed1b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beefsports"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
