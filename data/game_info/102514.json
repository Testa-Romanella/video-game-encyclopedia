Defend them as best you can.</p>\n<p>Your spaceship is the standard <strong>ESDF </strong>fighter model. As usual you can use the <strong>&lt;UP&gt;</strong> arrow for the thrusters, the <strong>&lt;LEFT&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;RIGHT&gt;</strong> arrows to rotate the ship and this particular model can utilise the <strong>&lt;DOWN&gt;</strong> arrow to rotate instantly on the opposite side of your forces. You can get extra boost for your ship by pressing the <strong>&lt;Z&gt;</strong> button.</p>\n<p>The armament is also standard. The <strong>&lt;SPACE&gt;</strong> button will fire the main cannons while the <strong>&lt;X&gt;</strong> will fire the plasma cannon. <br/></p>\n<p>Remember, you can stand on top of the ports to either repair your spaceship and refill on fuel and ammo as is shown by the icons.</p>\n<p>Good Luck Commander. We are counting on you</p><p>-- Post Jam Update--</p><p>- Added sound fx for hit counter, plasma cannon, charging and transmissions.</p><p>- When a port is destroyed the enemy fighters now are chasing you.</p><p>- When you run out of fuel the game does not end instantly.</p><p>- Plenty more to come after the stream.<br/>\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MeViPortal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
