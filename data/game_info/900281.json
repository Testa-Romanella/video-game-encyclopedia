Work to earn money, then spend this money on a game you might enjoy. Every month you pay a certain amount of money for rent, food etc. (This cost is 200$ unless if the weather is increasing it) if the money amount in your \"DOLLAR\" GUI is red, then you won't be able to survive the next month. But remember, working drains your \"FUN\", so you might want to check your fun before working. Play the games you have in order to fill your fun again, if your fun or money reaches 0 then you'll lose the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Watch out for storms, blackouts are likely during a storm and you can't play games if there's a blackout. You can't work either when there's a storm.</p>\n<p>There's the 4 seasons, each season has it's own challenges. The summer can be very hot which can increase the expenses but storm and rain is very rare in the summer. The winter can be very cold, but blackouts don't happen during blizzards.</p>\n<p>Every Friday, a video game sale starts and it doesn't end until the next Friday. Sales can be very helpful but they're very luck dependent.<br/><br/>This is only the first version, expect more content in the future!</p>\n<p>Will you be able to achieve your dreams despite being a struggling middle class? or is struggle your fate? It all depends on your actions, and well, sometimes the weather.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66af085afe028a06c5c040042ae39e22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelShell", "PixelBiscuit12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
