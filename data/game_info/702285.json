Explore islands generated procedurally, make smart moves and find the best route to maximize your score... Or just chill out in this silent night.<h3>Ride Santa's sleigh to deliver presents</h3><br/>Take the reins of Santa's sleigh and smoothly steer the magic reindeers. But be careful! It's not as easy as it seems, and you'll have to anticipate every move in order to deliver all the presents to the lit up houses.<h3>Explore Procedural Levels</h3><br/>All levels are generated procedurally which means that every game is a new one. You can fly away anytime you want if you don't like where you are.<h3>Find the route to best score</h3><br/>Achieving the best score is a subtle balance between finding the shortest route, riding near walls or fir trees, performing nice trick moves, and triggering combos at the right moment. You'll have to watch the environment carefully in order to seize every oppportunity available.<h3>Just chill out</h3><br/>If you're not into high scores, you can just enjoy peacefully riding the reindeers and discover the snowy environments in this Silent Night.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b73acff1d9e3ce9b6a1433cf15798903.jpg", "website": "http://www.oneiricworlds.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oneiric Worlds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Oneiric Worlds"], "esrb_rating": null}
