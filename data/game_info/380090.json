Starting with only a Gun and 10 Bullets you need to shoot your way out of it. Every defeated Zombie has a chance to drop Ammo and Health.<br/></p>\n<p>I started Horror Labyrinth as a fun project to learn Unity after some projects with Godot, but I really underrated the time cost of this project as a single indie dev. I'm open to ideas! In case you want to support my non existent budget I would be really happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Implemented Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gun</li><li>Zombies</li><li>Little sound effects</li><li>Items you can Pick up</li><li>One unfinished Maze</li><li>Zombie Animation and Sounds</li><li>Ammunition System</li><li>Health System</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Planned Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Different Zombies</li><li>Different Weapons</li><li>?Story?</li><li>More Mazes</li><li>Better Controls\u00a0</li><li>Better Aesthetics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec74607767f7e679e34d912361e6e34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["theropoy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
