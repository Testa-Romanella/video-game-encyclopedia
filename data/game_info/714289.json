It is a wish fulfilled after more than 35 years since I had my first computer (yes, it was our precious ZX Spectrum). I do things slowly but I keep my promises step by step :-)<br/>The game is slow and very improvable but I have no more time or knowledge to keep working on it. It has taken me about 3 months and believe me, I never imagined all the work it needs.<br/><br/><strong>Technical details and thanks:</strong><br/>- Mainly done in Basic and compiled with the zx Boriel compiler.<br/>- Graphics routines were made using pure assembler embedded in basic (David Webb's book).<br/>- The graphics and scenery were made in ZXPaintbrush.<br/>- I got the music from Marc Alexander's website and the player tank sprite was created by @jarlaxe.<br/>- It works with 48Kb models and later.<br/>- The source code is on Github:\u00a0Source<br/><br/>I hope you like it.<br/>Thanks for reporting bugs<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef82fa93a3d296701405dbcaa0f82a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Menyiques"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
