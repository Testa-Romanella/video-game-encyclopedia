The theme of \"Roll of the Dice\" is quite apparent here. You roll a die to move your character across the board like you would in any board game, but each space has the potential to either take you to one of the game's levels or modify the attributes of those levels! The game keeps going as long as you have hearts, so keep rolling to rack up your score!</p><p>Music Used:</p><p>Pixelland - Kevin MacLeod<br/></p><p>Up In My Jam - Kubbi<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f1f7a6534619a89ec6b485578a1439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Keeran S."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
