I think that a more intentional level generator can both fuel the player's imagination, and give people environmental hints about level layout\u00a0that feel helpful without also feeling cheap.</p>\n<p>I'm not yet sure if the combat system really worked out, so please do tell me about your experience with it. I learned that total symmetry between enemies and players makes balance very difficult, because defeating a tough enemy can mean you immediately have all their awesome gear.</p>\n\n<p>The Linux version was made possible by the author of\u00a0Delivery RL.
