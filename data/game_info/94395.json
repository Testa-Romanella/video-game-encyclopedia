(vol.I)", "description": "<p>Action Six! is a series of 6-game compilations, featuring a combination of games we've developed in the past, and games we're working on <strong>right now.</strong> These games are constructed around arcade-style, or endless play.</p>\n<p>Games included in Action Six! are also fairly prototype-- concepts that we wanted to test out before going into development with them. </p>\n<p>The \"completion\" state of some of these games is questionable, but they're all typically built around repeating play.</p>\n<p>Some Action Six! titles are in continued development-- occasionally, we may release AX6 updates to various volumes to update the games included to better versions.</p>\n<p>With your purchase, you help us keep bills paid and get better hardware / software while we continue work on larger projects.
