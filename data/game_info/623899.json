It is currently unfinished but I plan to actively work on it until it is a complete game. The first release is completely lacking in functional hazards or enemies. Collecting the key is as far into the game as it is currently possible to get. Upon getting the key you will unlock the double jump and fire attacks from unfinished parts of the game. Additionally there are two collectable life upgrades.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Jump - v</p>\n<p>Claws - c</p>\n<p>Fire - x</p>\n<p>Ice - z</p>\n<p>All game content and the engine is created by Ethan Janssen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2dfcea4ebb555ce6c27f8fde6421a58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emanosaurus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
