{"id": 962034, "slug": "burning-branch", "name": "Burning Branch", "name_original": "Burning Branch", "description": "Burning Branch is an action rogue-like that will see you hack and slashing your way through a myriad of unique bosses in a miniature animal inhabited world that death forgot.<br/><br/><h3>BENEATH THE CANOPY</h3>It towers in the distance, a colossal tree with an indifferent burning eye. The tree that holds your lover. Getting to it is no easy task, but with every new attempt you get stronger, closer. And start to uncover that the reason behind your journey isn't so simple.<h3>BURN BRIGHT</h3>Nothing will keep you from your love. Combine uniquely forged weapons and magic from the stars. Creating many powerful synergies and countless unique character builds that you\u2019ll use to blaze a trail directly to the top of that accursed tree.<h3>FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, CRITTERS AND COMPANIONS</h3>Many small creatures with big complex personalities litter this world. Everything from rodents and birds, all the way to ghosts, vampires, and demons inhabiting objects in every meaning of that word. All truly unique people to befriend, annoy, estrange, and care for.<h3>DEATH WAS NEVER THE END</h3>Biting the dust after a failed rescue attempt is just another step. Emerge from the ashes. Power  up your keepsakes and become permanently stronger. And dive back into another journey facing off against adversaries that actually remember the last time they killed you.<h3>UNCOMPROMISING LOVE LEAVES LOVERS WITHOUT COMPROMISE</h3>Featuring a deeply personal and considered story about romantic love, but not about romance. A story not about the soaring high feelings that make someone say, \u2018I wanna stay with you forever\u2019. But what those feelings materially mean for both parties, and everyone caught in the crossfire.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-12T02:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d122928d67b27e7a62eec80c88a3b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moon Touched"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moon Touched"], "esrb_rating": null}
