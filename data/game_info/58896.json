It is a part of Ubisoft reboot of the series that features the new setting, Ashan, albeit similar to the original Enroth.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Clash of Heroes takes place in the medieval high fantasy world. It is set 40 years before the events depicted in Heroes of Might and Magic V. The game follows five heroes. Two of them already featured in HoM&amp;M V (Godric the knight and Anwen the elf), while three others are original (Aidan, who commands demons, a wizard Nadia and a necromancer Fiona). They oppose the demon lord who is searching for an artifact called Blade of Binding. He is going to use it to open the portal into his demon world and unleash his armies on Ashan.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In the campaign mode, the player assumes the role of one hero of his or her choice. Each hero represents one of the five traditional HoM&amp;M factions (humans, elves, demons, wizards, and the undead) and has his or her unique roster of units. Heroes navigate the map in real-time, but the battles are turn-based. Like in HoM&amp;M games, the heroes command their armies rather than fight on their own. The combat system, however, changed dramatically. In Clash of Heroes, it resembles a puzzle game of colored columns and rows. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>There are both local and online multiplayer modes that allow two players to compete against each other, to cooperate against AI or the other team of two players.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2009-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T16:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d46/d460c5c8a9e417ef302ebbc0bb946b26.jpg", "website": "http://mightandmagic.us.ubi.com/clashofheroes/", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 794, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 36, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 89, "suggestions_count": 576, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 89, "platforms": ["Android", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC", "iOS", "Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Ubisoft", "Capybara Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
