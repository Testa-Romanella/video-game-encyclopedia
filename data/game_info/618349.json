On your way back from your daily gathering, you spot the shiniest object you've ever seen in your life. One problem: it's at the top of a castle. Make your way through its dungeons in order to claim your once-in-a-lifetime shiny object.</p>\n<p>READ BEFORE PLAYING ~~~</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD, space for jump, escape for options, E for depositing coins in an ATM and for going through doors, and Q for withdrawing them.</p>\n<p>At each level, you must figure out a way to make it to the big door with all 4 coins on Lorenzo. Use the ATM strategically to lose weight, but keep in mind you must reach the end with all coins on yourself (meaning no coins can be left in the ATM). On levels with multiple ATMs, keep in mind coins don't transfer between ATMs.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>This was made for the GMTK game jam in 2021, so look forward to future updates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3da729b9d85c507b260de893eff4af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaptainSub"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
