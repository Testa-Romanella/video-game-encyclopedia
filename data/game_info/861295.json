You\u2019ll be joined (quite literally) by <strong>Snatch</strong>, a snarky demon gauntlet that somewhat forcibly replaced one of your hands and acts as a grappling hook, granting you the ability to zip around the environment, reach difficult places and occasionally get out of uncomfortable exchanges with the city guard.<br/><br/>Explore freely each nook and cranny of hand crafted, open levels with tons of secrets to discover and other people\u2019s stuff to acquire (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re all despicable).<br/><br/>An immersive adventure inspired by classic collectathons, with a stealth twist and designed from the ground up for VR.<br/><br/><h3>AGILE, IMMERSIVE AND COMFORTABLE LOCOMOTION</h3>Zip around with the agile grappling mechanics. Sneak around with the smooth locomotion system, with lots of comfort settings (and you can always rely on your grappler if smooth locomotion is not for you).<br/><br/><h3>EXPLORE OPEN, HAND CRAFTED ENVIRONMENTS</h3>Explore open, intricate, hand crafted environments with lots to discover (and steal).<br/><br/><h3>OUTSMART YOUR ENEMIES</h3>Avoiding being seen or heard, and even pickpocket them right under their noses (if your fingers are light enough)<br/><br/><h3>WISHLIST US!</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T03:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/1514d061ad65aee7bde754f4640c6c47.jpg", "website": "https://en.venturion.com.br/slink-snatch", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Venturion"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Venturion"], "esrb_rating": null}
