You will also find you cannot fly everywhere :)</p>\n<p>- Alt-F4 or force close the app to quit (sorry there's no menus or real end game yet!)</p>\n\n<p>TIPS: Look for hints in the environment as to how to solve the current puzzle. As mentioned object manipulation is required.</p><p>CREDITS: While I did most of the work in putting things together I cannot take credit for the awesome visual assets or the sound elements:</p><p>-\u00a0Visual Assets:\u00a0Synty\u00a0Fantasy Kingdom</p><p>- Sound:\u00a0Cafofo Dungeon Sounds.</p>\n\n<p>Final Note:\u00a0This is my first project completed using the Unreal Engine (Blueprints and C++) and while it has some potential to evolve and certainly needs some polish (main menu and end game UI at least!), it will be some time before it gets that love so enjoy it for the short experience it offers! This is also a PC only build for the time being and requires a mouse and keyboard to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/892f62de623cd42e84c47563c1ce5fdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PicusB"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
