It tells the story of how\u00a0L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n, a revered water dragon king, and\u00a0\u00c2u C\u01a1, a beautiful descendant of mountain fairies (sometimes depicted as a\u00a0Chim L\u1ea1c, \"Lost Bird\", a pre-colonial mythical bird) fell in love and gave birth to the first 100 Vietnamese people. However they could not be together because being together meant being away from their homelands, so\u00a0L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n took 50 children to the sea and\u00a0\u00c2u C\u01a1 took 50 children to the mountains and that's the origin of the seafolk and mountainfolk that make up the two halves of Vietnam.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Free to play on browser and on mobile.\u00a0Arrows and WASD to move\u00a0 and interact\u00a0on desktop browser.
