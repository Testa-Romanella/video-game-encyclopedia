Click to play through the story with combat\u00a0 being menu driven. Each attack has a different cost in stamina and the damage it does to enemies. The color of the enemy name indicates their approximate health \u00a0with green being good, yellow indicating damaged, and red for near death. You can restore stamina by defending which also reduces (or eliminates for some monsters) damage.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Some of the art for the game is creative commons or open source as follows:</p>\n<p>Phoenix by Friedrich Johann Justin Bertuch (1747\u20131822) public domain</p>\n<p>Cinnamon tree by Augustus Binu under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0.</p>\n<p>Resin extruding from trunk of mature Araucaria Columnaris by\u00a0 Kumar83 under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0</p>\n<p>1024px-Apis_mellifera_scutellata by Jeffrey W.
