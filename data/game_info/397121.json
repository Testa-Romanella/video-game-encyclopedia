Can you get a block into the hoop?</p>\n<p><strong>try it</strong><br/></p>\n<p>or don't<br/></p>\n<p>The game really revolves around two blocks and a hoop. The game is physics based<br/></p>\n<p>and you can place a maximum of 10 blocks at a time. There are many means to help you get a block into the hoop, but when you do it's pretty awesome.\u00a0<em>or maybe i'm just really really bad</em><em>\u00a0at my own game.\u00a0</em> The controls to pick up and control blocks are intentionally annoying. So good luck with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't intend on updating the game a lot but there may be a few minor updates here and there. Mostly a small project for all to enjoy.\u00a0 With that said I'm open to any suggestions and criticisms anyone has</p>\r\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\nBuilding: Enter Build Mode: Middle Click, \r\nExit Build Mode: Middle click while in build mode,\r\nPlace Block: Left Click \r\nDelete Block: Right Click on placed block\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nand yes, i love using every type of text i can", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:41:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19da0a043392eea8ca4e07279728f162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saltirezzz"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
