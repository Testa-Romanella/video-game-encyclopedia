You\u2019re not alone though, you can collect a power-up to temporarily freeze the clones and smash into them to destroy them!<br/><br/>Can you avoid your clones long enough to collect 15 Coins?<br/><br/>================<br/><br/>&amp;quot;15 Coins is a rather intriguing game that I have fun playing, and a fantastic example of how minimalistic, challenging arcade games should be done.&amp;quot; - 148apps.com - Rated 4.0/5.0<br/><br/>&amp;quot;15 Coins is a simple arcade style game that is impossibly difficult.
