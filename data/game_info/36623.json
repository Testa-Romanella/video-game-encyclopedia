After a terrible man-made disaster, new generations of earthlings had to adapt to a new culture and system of life values. The world is ruled by small clans and religious organizations. The main conflict is between the officially ruling power of the religious cult of Synergetics, who control the city of Stronghold, and the underground sect of the Transcendental Vision, whose positions are strong in the city of Camelot. The main character, due to the circumstances, must perform tasks received from both the first and second parties. In some game situations, he will be forced to cross paths with two gangs: Reapers and Rivers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T06:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a15/a1575ade06a3b136ae3f9c41036f7d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 644, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4Reign Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Akella"], "esrb_rating": null}
