This curse, the Droughtlock, has had a tight grip on the few residents for the last 10 years.\r\n </p>\n<p>Perhaps the inconspicuous well-maiden Vinnagan can aid to bring the divine tears &amp; water the land again.\r\n </p>\n<p>Classes:</p>\n<p>The Immortals: the legendary ghosts of the imperial robber barons. Difficult to kill. Immortals can wear heavy armor. Thzey Fight with strength-weapons. Have a spell that will make them almost invincible for a short time.\r\n </p>\n<p>The Bedouins: the insidious nomads of the north. They start with a lot of stamina &amp; high attack value. They are trained to encounter wild medicinal grass. Bedouins can only wear light armor and wield dexterity-weapons.\r\n </p>\n<p>The Ghouls: Who fights the overpopulation in the Empire's cemeteries? &gt;That's right, gravedigger-cannibals.
