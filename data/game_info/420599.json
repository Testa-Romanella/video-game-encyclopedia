After a few minutes of listing outrageous game ideas, we conceded that we probably shouldn't do that, but I never pass up an opportunity for a shitpost.</p>\n<p>To pre-emptively torture myself for the sins I was about to commit, I wrote the game from scratch in pure Java. It was painful, but I regret nothing.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was supposed to be our joke backup game, which we would only submit if Unity failed so catastrophically, that we couldn't get our main game playable. That didn't happen, but I'm posting it anyways.</p>\n<p>Oh, right, the game: it's a space invaders rip-off. L&amp;R arrow keys to move hospital, spacebar to shoot vaccine shots at flying coronaviruses. If 3 get past you, you die. And then you have to restart the game, because I couldn't be bothered to program in a reset function.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4f3ab95244b661ec4d0f006f69d345.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["franga2000"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
