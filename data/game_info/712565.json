Your mission is to stop them, destroy their key targets before time runs out and they launch nuclear strikes around the world.  Scorpion will patrol each island making sure that their plans stay intact.  That means you will have to strategize your assault on the two main islands or tip Scorpion to your presence which will cause them to attack you and your aircraft carrier.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou may hear an ominous sound around New Scorpion Island, one of the newer islands that make up Scorpion Islands!  Scorpion is using the rare resources of this massive volcano to produce chemicals and materials for their destructive goals of world domination and to spread fear across the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's up to you to save the world!  You start with a capable helicopter and the finest aircraft carrier for supplies and safety.  Your mission is to destroy all of Scorpion's key factories and nuclear weapons before they launch their nuclear strike.  Each factory can be repaired after taking damage so make sure you finish bombing it once you start.  Supply ships provide supplies between the two main islands so that repairs can take place for those factories that are damaged.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T03:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8e/b8e60961ed81487e28b30f11942ffc7e.jpg", "website": "http://www.raidonscorpionisland.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WALKER GAME STUDIO"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WALKER GAME STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
