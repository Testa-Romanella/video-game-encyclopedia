It's an art piece. So, please, treat it as one and contemplate it on OUR terms.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong>Contemplate</strong></em><em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>is an artistic game that pokes fun on the pretentiousness of being called an art game and the logical consequences of imposing a point of view on someone.</em> Throughout the game, you'll find yourself being forced to \"admire\" a game on the whims of its own narrator, and not on your own terms.\u00a0<strong>Maybe to the narrator, \"contempt\" and his use of the word\u00a0\"contemplate\" are closer to each other than he thinks.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>At its core, Contemplate is not only a commentary on believing you're always right and bellitling someone gratuitously, it's also\u00a0<strong>a bit of an exploration on how hard it is to engage a player into a more abstract experience</strong>. Maybe you'll be tantalized by something in the game - maybe you don't. Is it even possible to predict that? How much playtesting is needed for that? It's a testament to the amazing craftsmanship of games like Flower and Journey, that they managed to attain that level of critical acclaim and success with excellent player retention - while never sacrificing their ability to pause and smell the roses.<br/></p>\n<p>So... How about it? Want to\u00a0get in and try your best to entretain yourself - or will you find it absolutely boring? Who knows - Maybe you'll find something actually worth your time.\u00a0Or then again... maybe not.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>WASD - Move</em></p>\n<p><em>Space - Jump</em></p>\n<p><em>Shift - Run</em></p>\n<p><em>E - Next Scene</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Adherence to the Jam's Theme:</em></strong>\u00a0The game takes the \"artistic\" and \"experimental\" genre and flips it on its head, taking away the player's ability to experiment and explore on their own terms. Not all of the game is accessible; not all of it has anything to experiment on - <strong>an experimental game without being able to experiment</strong>, a\u00a0contemplative game that doesn't allow players to\u00a0contemplate in their own way. That's how we remove from a\u00a0<strong>Genre</strong>\u00a0its most iconic\u00a0<strong>Mechanic</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another subversion of the genre is the presence of a *domineering, pretentious narrator*, satirizing general narrative conventions of such genre\u00a0and taking a book out of \"The Stanley Parable\" and \"The Begginer's Guide\".</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Engine:\u00a0<em>Unity\u00a02018.2.6</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Repository:\u00a0<em>Github</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art: <em>SpeedTree</em><em>\u00a0+\u00a0Adobe Photoshop CC + 3DMax</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming:\u00a0<em>Visual Studio Code\u00a0+ Ink\u00a0+ Sourcetree</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound: <em>FL Studio\u00a0+ <strong>\u00a0Logic Pro</strong></em></strong></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p><strong>ART<br/></strong>Larissa Gazzoni<br/>Lucas Lima</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAME DESIGN<br/></strong>Fernanda Netto<br/>Gabriel Medeiros<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>PROGRAMMING<br/></strong>Gustavo Marchesan<br/>Renan da Fonte<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>SOUND DESIGN<br/></strong>Lucas Lima</p>\n\n<p><strong>NARRATION</strong><br/>Gabriel Medeiros</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong></p>\n<p>Daniel Oliveira</p>\n<p>Matheus Homsi</p>\n<p>RPG - Rio PUC Games</p>\n<p>PUC Rio</p>\n<p>Mark Brown &amp; GMTK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f506a99aad7394316a13c9973f4188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyber Twilight", "Lucas Lima", "gazzonilarissa", "Fernanda Netto", "PantsOnHead", "Renan da Fonte"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
