Isn't that all you need to know?<br/><br/>...Oh, okay then.What is Barbarian Brawl?Barbarian Brawl is a 3rd person multiplayer action brawler, where you battle in groups of up to 20-players in a deadly, trap-ridden battle arena, which also resembles a Barbarian village, because nothing says welcome home like a swinging guillotine or hidden bear trap.It has a story?Sort of. In a small camp high in the mountains of a fictional universe that hasn't been named (any ideas?), lives a little known tribe of Barbarians who mostly fight each other and eat lots of ham. LOTS of ham. Ham is really good you see, and it gives the Barbarians more energy to fight... and so the cycle continues.CharactersChoose one of the six unique Barbarians, each with their own key strengths, weaknesses and awesome names. <br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Baarbaar<br/></li><li>Klondike<br/></li><li>Mr Rotten<br/></li><li>Buttercup  <br/></li><li>BrynHildr <br/></li><li>Crazy Eyes</li></ul>Game modes<br/><ul><li>Free-for-All </li></ul>Free-for-All is all about bashing in skulls and dismembering limbs.
