We've all lost something. We've all traveled through the stages. This game is a peek into the symbolic world of the mind and the heart as they learn to cope with grief.</p>\n<p>Its submerged in metaphors and wrapped up in a beautiful and challenging puzzle-platformer shell. You play as the naive heart, challenging the complexities of the mind to help it feel again.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>The Heart<br/></p>\r\n The Brain<br/>\n<p> Denial</p>\n<p> Anger<br/></p>\n<p>Depression<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had the time to finish this project. I fell in love with the idea, but simply don't have the time to pour into it. I've done all the art, music, and coding so far. The story? It wrote itself.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Please play this through, if you like it, donate. If I reach my goal, I won't have to work this summer, and I'll devote that time before next semester to this game.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks you to anyone who gives this concept a chance. It means a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T10:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/1540b6893f84bf79edefac46d99dc05e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Green Panda Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
