NG73)</strong></p>\n<p>Destroy all the daleks by making them collide with each other or with the debris.</p>\n<p>Use the joystick in port 2 to move.</p>\n<p>Attention: you can only move up, down, right and left, NOT diagonally.Daleks, on the other hand, can move diagonally. Hide behind barriers and obstacles.Use the \"T\" KEY to teleport to a random spot in the surrounding space. You have 9 space teleporters for life.<br/>Enter the tardis to move to the other time period; here too you will find daleks to destroy.<br/>When you change epochs by entering the tardis, the debris from the epoch of departure vanishes and you will not be able to exploit it to destroy the remaining daleks.</p>\n<p>To go to the next level you have to destroy all the daleks of the two dimensions.<br/>You have 5 lives available; you lose one when you collide with daleks or wrecks.</p>\n<p>The demo has 9 levels. At each level the number of daleks increases.</p>\n<p>Credits: sound effects by Hein Holt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T16:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/57945f1d91ccfc7619f71fe6cb9c3cf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retro Programmers Inside"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
