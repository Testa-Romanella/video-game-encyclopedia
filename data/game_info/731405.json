It's my first attempt at a 2D platformer game. I wanted to go for a non-violent type of win goal, so the main concept is that you play as a wildlife biologist who has to tag endangered beasts through a high-tech camera.\u00a0Tagging all the monsters in the level  should unlock data in the  bestiary (not implemented).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The level is not finished and the rating feature is temporarily disabled until the game is updated to be a prototype where the stage can be cleared.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The concept, code and art were all created by myself during the jam.
