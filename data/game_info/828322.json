By building this\u00a0way-station system trough the galaxies -\u00a0their goal was to transcribe better the encoded messages from the Stars, as well to possibly\u00a0establish two-way connections with the Stars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their experiment suggest, that the\u00a0Stars transmit a\u00a0subatomic\u00a0message, that penetrates and\u00a0\u00a0governs meaningfully the Universe. It organizes and shapes matter by assisting and directing the\u00a0processes of it. Evolution of new\u00a0functions and possibilities\u00a0- both in living and non-living matter arises from those received\u00a0messages - in a form of a blueprints.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0builders and their civilizations have disappeared, and from what it appears - the experiment have failed. Because of the nature of how\u00a0the\u00a0stations exist -\u00a0in-between dimensional; and because\u00a0the existence of the stations require constant feed of currently unstable\u00a0auxiliary sub-level systems - with time the feed that keep the\u00a0existence of the stations - fails.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0What you can explore from the work of the builders -\u00a0is a series of\u00a0obscured\u00a0broken visions looped in repeat,\u00a0called The Echo. You, the\u00a0explorer - is the first to discover them. Or so you think so.</p>\n<em>Will\u00a0Heptic have a continuation? Or maybe a form with more defined game-play,\u00a0interactions, dialogues and puzzles?</em>\n<p>\u00a0Currently I am just opening a door. I want it to stay\u00a0open and possibly enter trough it; and dedicate more on that\u00a0idea. Some backing will be of great use.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:01:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/604fe8dfe244289044e2b716eed8acec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LyubomirIko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
