The name referring to an incident that occurred on the farm one fateful day in early fall of that year.<br/>Upon returning home from a trip into town, a trip mind you that takes the better part of a day, Jacob Atkins discovered his wife, Emilia, in the arms of a shoe peddler. Seeing the two together, he flew into a rage, killing both his wife, and the peddler. The farm, from that moment on, was known to the locals as 'Where the peddler met his end'.<br/>Grief stricken over the tragedy, only a few weeks later Jacob Atkins himself took his own life, hanging himself from one of the rafters in the barn.<br/>Upon the death of Jacob and Emilia, their 23 year old daughter Sarah, was left alone to tend to the farm. Sometime during that winter Sarah went missing, and was not heard from again.\u00a0<br/><br/>The farm fell to disrepair, until sometime in the late 1960's, when it was purchased by Rodger and Millie Hilkins. Hilkins Farm produced corn for cattle feed for many years, until an accident with his farm tractor in 1992 left Rodger with only his left leg. The two continued to own the farm right up until 2003, when Millie took ill of a respiratory infection, and passed away. Rodger then sold the farm to his then neighbor Milton Hawlkes, who over the next several years, let the farm sit, and decay. \u00a0<br/><br/>Hawlkes, late one evening, after a long bout of drinking, attempted to burn the barn down, along with the adjoining field. He poured gasoline from the inside of the barn, along a path through the corn, which although uncultivated for a time, still grew. He then ignited the gas with a match, and set the field a blaze.\u00a0<br/>His attempt failed. A rain storm sweeping in from over the mountain ridge extinguished the fire, but not before taking most of the farmhouse with it. And as for Milton Hawlkes, he in his drunken attempt to destroy the farm, fell, and burned a large portion of himself with it. His right hand was lost, and almost half his face needed to be grafted.<br/>When asked why he tried to burn his own property, he replied that he had always hated that farm. He said that it was cursed, and the soil was sour. He even claimed that from time to time he would see Jacob chasing his wife through the field, bringing her again to her horrible end. And some early mornings, he would open the barn door to find the rope still gently swinging from the rafter that had relieved Mr Atkins of his guilt decades before.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af4add61b7bcb56bd2205ac343cb0f1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sinister Twist Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
