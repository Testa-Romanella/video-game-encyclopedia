Also \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\the often loses his hand, so it is hidden \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tin his pocket most of time.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Roxanna</strong><br/>\r\n\t\tRag-fairy - Little silly girl with a big \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tmelodic dream. She is soft to the \r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\ttouch too.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong> </strong><strong>Volia </strong><br/>\r\n\t\tAqua-fairy - Self-confident boy made<br/>\r\n\t\tof magical clay who possesses ability <br/>\r\n\t\tto control water. He is water. He is sane.<br/>\r\n\t\tHe loves to eat.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\n<strong>Skootis  </strong><br/>\r\n\t\tAsh-fairy - She will be the strongest,<br/>\r\n\t\tyou hear me? This is for <br/>\r\n\t\tsure is not her writings! But it is truth!\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Rinka </strong><br/>\r\n\t\tBarbarian-fairy -  This girl surely loves <br/>\r\n\t\tmarzipan cakes. And to crush stuff <br/>\r\n\t\twhen cake goes not into her belly. <br/>\r\n\t\tAnd hey, she is important!\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tLittle cute fairies live in this world. Having fun! Working together to solve problems! Eating food that the necromancer makes!  Working together to create problems! Exactly the life from a fairy-tale! Isn't it?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOh, Fairy Lands, what a silly place~!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\"You should work hard and be smart about your actions\" - says Wiseghaika, strange creature that lives by the Lake. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tShe'd like to be your instructor, she'd like to give you answers!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Fairy Gems?</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWeird gems are falling from the skies! Who will manage to do something about it? Maybe Rinka? Well, Wiseghaika surely hopes that somebody will do something.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSome fairies managed to learn how to use them as a weapon, so fights will be less painful. But not all of them have mastered this art. To be exact - neither of our six heroes can use those mysterious stones in big barrages. This... might give you some problems. But c'mon, since when were heroes stronger that their foes? (Please, don't say it in front of Skootis.)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBack to gems! Weird thing about them - when two of the same color collide, they go \"ding\" and release some weird spheres. Those spheres can  absorb other gems! Red spheres, for example, absorb all red gems, they meet, but will stop after absorbing any gem that isn't red. The same happens with others, mostly-maybe! ('^' )\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf gems will touch left side of your screen, you'll get hurt! Does it makes sense? What are \"screens\"? I heard abut them from Astro-fairies, but now they are extinct, so I can't ask them.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tGray gems are different and weird! They won't hurt you and most likely will disappear after touching that weird shield in front of you. It is almost like they're devoid of energy. But you shouldn't take them too easy - You can't destroy them as there are no gray gems in your arsenal, so, only way is either to wait while they will be destroyed by the barrier, or make some sphere touch them.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>  =About the game itself=</strong></p><p>This game is made in the vein of old puzzle-like games, without real twist. Just simple active puzzle.Or maybe there is some twist?</p><p>\r\n\tFor the first game made with this engine I think it is good job from my side, considering, that everything except music is made by sole silly me.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNow, there is a couple known bugs that can occur, but won't destroy game too much, or maybe they are finally gone -  couldn't get them last beta-testing session. Game just... likes to be important to you, so please remember to put it on a pause, if you suddenly need to do something else, while playing.
