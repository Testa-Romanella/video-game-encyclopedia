Finally deciding that they want to make things right between them, Tara sets off for home, but gets lost along the way.</p>\n<p>When I heard the theme of \u201cWhat Home Means\u201d, one of my first thoughts was the Odyssey, a long process of returning home. I wanted to make something similar, but that quickly turned into another thing after brainstorming with the team about home means to us, or what we think of when we think of home. Love, safety, forgiveness, and familiarity were just some of the things that the team brought up. What we consider home isn\u2019t always a physical place. Of course, home isn\u2019t always perfect. I also wanted to touch upon the parts of home that are difficult to deal with sometimes, while acknowledging that these things don\u2019t always have to contradict or negate the other more positive aspects we more readily consider. - Riley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T03:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92b2b159a42bd4bf1fe20a7a2d7bd762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dsaname", "RazzberryBlitz", "OrangeChicken", "SupriseOrb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
