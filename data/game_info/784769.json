I want to go for PS1 RPG style with this one. Better music is needed. I kinda just winged it and old DS MIDI program.

More levels will be made as well as some range to enemy AI and bosses for more interactivity. Mobile port if possible.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T13:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/0161c43e8805ef76ef1a9cbd6cd1e1db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["willWallace-RIT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
