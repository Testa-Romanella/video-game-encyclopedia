And the walls, cause they're rocks as well. And the floor! Basically everything that's normally rock. And when you remove the boulders from Boulder Dash, only Dash is left. So I made it about dashing... I know, it really stretches the theme but when I had the idea while panicking during the jam, I was really hyped about it...</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>[SPACE] [LMB] - dash towards cursor</p>\n\n<p>Q/A:</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the character in a panda costume?</p>\n<p>A: I don't know...
