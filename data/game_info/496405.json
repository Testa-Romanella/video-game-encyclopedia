A weak, downtrodden soul who stared into the void between the stars and dared to ask for mercy. You fulfilled their wish, willingly. Where you end and they begin is hard to tell, now. They have\u00a0become far more than they could ever have imagined. And you? You\u2019ve only\u00a0just begun. There are many, many more that pray for guidance. They, too, will\u00a0become Ascendant. In time.</em> </p>\n<p>The Ascendant is a playbook for <em>Blades in the Dark,\u00a0</em>designed for the\u00a0Unusual Suspects Jam with the help of the\u00a0Blades Playbook Template. It has been pitched as somewhere on the popstar-warlock scale, as well as the Taylor Swift - Galadriel spectrum. Themes of divinity, fandom, and other problematic social structures abound.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:02:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1e4854e9c56973bb8e63ff895796cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Umbra"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
