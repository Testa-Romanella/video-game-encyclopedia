You are not just the innkeeper for beer, you are the keeper of balance between luck and bad luck. Pick up the items and deliver them to the customer to hold the balance and get points. But be careful! When the balance is out of range you will get less points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Note: The mood of the customers\u00a0luck and bad luck\u00a0will change after 18 seconds ;)</p><p>I hope you enjoy this little game and give me some feedback what can be better or what is a good point to optimize. Of course, nice feedback is also welcome :)</p>\n<p>P.S.: Sometimes the UI-arrangement could be out of position. Clicking through the menues can fix that problem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T08:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea6e5c0381cc3d070a6a3cacaffe9fad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BearDream Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
