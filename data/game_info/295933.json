No?</p>\n<p>Well, this semi-idle game is based on the same world renowned pet system. Unlike of time capture or motion capture, this digital friend of yours consumes light particles capturable from your smartphone's light sensors.</p>\n<p>Maybe you don't have light sensors on your phone? Your digital friend can feed off time particles that your device should have. Or maybe not?</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in developing this game further (especially art), please do not hesitate to contact me to partner on this project. If you are ambitious with your art:\u00a0 you can add your own character and voice, and I will be able to create an AI based on your character.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>\n<p>Social Studies, a four-panel comic I am developing.</p>\n<p>https://www.deviantart.com/associatedpigeon/art/Social-Studies-Page001-785364341</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7ae1a4c9d05a559932afd7fccf7fecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["alanjpan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
