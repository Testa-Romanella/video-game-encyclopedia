This is what level 21 of the game looks like (also in the screenshots for the game):<br/></p>\n<p>{{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,2,1,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}},</p>\n<p>And these are what the numbers correspond to:<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Empty = 0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Wall = 1<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Storage = 2<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Box = 3<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Player = 4<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BoxOnStorage = 5<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PlayerOnStorage = 6</p>\n<p>Storage being where you want to push the boxes to complete the level.<br/></p>\n<p>So if you want your level to show up in the game post a level \u00a0you have designed in the format above in the comments. For each 10 levels in the comments that aren't duplicates, I will add the levels to the game and do a new release. The initial plan is to limit this to one level per user. There will also be a limit of 120 new levels to begin with but with future changes this may increase.<br/><br/>I will create a devlog for each release and list the new levels, who created it and what level number it will appear as in game.</p>\n<p>Please stick to the 16x10 grid format. Below I will also share a grid with all zeros if you'd like to start with that instead of the one above.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>{{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}},</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a port of a game I created for the xbox a good while ago which can be found here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T12:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85f/85f6bf01d07ee06091ff61d7b2c348fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anefiox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
