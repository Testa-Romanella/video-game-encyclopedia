{"id": 286579, "slug": "last-oasis", "name": "Last Oasis", "name_original": "Last Oasis", "description": "<p>Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO. Earth has stopped rotating, and the last human survivors need to outrun the scorching Sun in a massive Open World.Walkers<br />\nTraverse the world on wooden wind-powered, walking machines. Walkers can be adapted for travel, transportation, harvesting, combat, or used as mobile bases. A multitude of structures, attachments and upgrades allow players to personalize Walkers to their needs.The Scorching Sun<br />\nThe Sun burns the land in the west, turning it to dust. In order to stay ahead of the obliterating Sun, nomads must explore new territories that slowly emerge on the eastern horizon, from the side of the Earth that has long been frozen in impenetrable ice.The Lore<br />\nAfter a cataclysmic event halted the Earth\u2019s rotation, the planet was split into two extreme and deadly environments. Only a narrow band of space between the hot and cold halves of the planet has conditions that can support life. This band moves at the pace of the planet\u2019s rotation around the Sun, and all life on Earth must migrate with it to survive. In order to keep moving, the remnants of humanity have built nomadic machines, and a walking city called Flotilla.<br />\nEvery day, Flotilla transports more nomads into the passing oases, where warring clans fight tooth and nail for control of territory and valuable resources. Some nomads have carved out lucrative positions for themselves and even gained status with Flotilla; however most nomads are locked in a daily struggle for survival, forced to battle both nature and those around them. There will never be rest for the men who built the walkers; they can only move forward.Survive and Thrive<br />\nFind ways to survive. Gather resources. Craft equipment. Build your Walker. Improve your skills. Learn to exploit what remains of the world. Keep your Nomad alive for as long as you can, as you become stronger the longer you escape death.Trade in a Player Driven Economy<br />\nTrade networks stretch between the known oases. The global player-driven economy is based on real supply and demand. Smart and quick traders can make huge profits, but running trade routes always comes with a risk. Other nomads may opt to produce or hunt down rare and highly localized resources. It\u2019s always wise to consider potential competitors first though. Challenge another clan\u2019s monopoly, and you may become their next target.Travel and Explore an MMO-sized World<br />\nThe world consists of many interconnected oases, forming a large open world. Potentially a thousand oases exist simultaneously - the number automatically adjusts to accommodate the size of the playerbase. Each Oasis is over 100 km2. Explore them to reveal new and unique biomes while plundering their limited resources. Some nomads may pitstop to refill their water. Others will settle for some time, but ultimately everyone will pick up and voyage east to escape the encroaching Sun.No-Man&#39;s-Land<br />\nNo-Man\u2019s Land is the open desert that sits between the last livable oases on Earth. Use it to quickly travel between adjacent oases, provided you bring enough water on your Walker. You can safely log off here \u2013 the endless dunes allow you to hide your walker and mobile base if you want to go to sleep or just catch a breath.Melee and Walker Combat<br />\nDynamic skill-based directional melee combat. Pick your weapon from a range of one-handed or two-handed swords, maces, axes or quarterstaves. If you prefer to hammer your opponents from a distance, you can choose to fight with a wide range of onboard weapons like ballistas, scattershot guns, repeaters, or catapults. Specialize in one or become a more versatile fighter by trying to master them all.Building Bases<br />\nConstruct portable bases or more permanent fortifications. Protect yourself from hostile players and natural dangers of the world. Stone walls offer superior defense, while lighter wooden structures are able to be packed on large Walkers and relocated.Solo Experience<br />\nIndividuals and small groups of players are the backbone of Last Oasis. Trading, hunting and harvesting allows anyone to acquire better equipment or sell goods for profit. For those who prefer a more high-risk, high-reward lifestyle, piracy is always an option, but beware of payback.Clans and Warfare<br />\nBecome a political and economic power. Control a region and get rewarded with a supply of local resources gathered there by roaming Nomads. Grow your clan and make alliances to maximize and protect your income. Always be ready for conflict \u2013 hostile clans will challenge your control and come to take away everything you\u2019ve built.Grappling Hook<br />\nMaster the vertical movement. Every Nomad owns a grappling hook \u2013 the most essential and iconic tool of those who drive walkers. Adapt it to your playstyle. It\u2019s all about your skill: some struggle to climb the smallest rocks, while others swing through forests outspeeding even the fastest Walkers. Can you defy gravity?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T07:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35bd4bc67a4b43f31db75745fe867969.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 704, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 6, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 556, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donkey Crew"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Donkey Crew"], "esrb_rating": null}
