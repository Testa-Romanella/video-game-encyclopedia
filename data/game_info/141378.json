I've laid a ton of clues as to an answer of a certain question, and that is: \"Who are you playing as\". This is the hidden bit that I've added, and that requires some searching and theorizing to fully understand. The only hint that I'll give you is that this is a real story, so no characters were made up by me, but there are or were actual real life humans.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that hints and secret lore bita about this game may be found everywhere, and that includes the font used, color coding mixed with actual puzzle mechanics, the space that you are in, your appearance and of course the lines that the shadows say, as well as some replies may give to a few questions about the mystery, never the full answer though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8d4c0a79d2c6d1737ba858f5dd583d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J\u0337\u0307\u033ba\u0337\u035d\u0356s\u0337\u033f\u032do\u0336\u0315\u0354n\u0334\u0303\u031e"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
