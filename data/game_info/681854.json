The path you must take\u00a0is obscured, but you can use a radar to see it for a short amount of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You need to go from one big recharge station to another. You will encounter small recharge stations along the way - they will recharge you once, if you stop right on top of them. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play?<br/><br/></strong>Press the screen where the rover is standing and start drawing \"the path\" made of white tiles. You can always go back, and you can also drag the finger back to the rover to cancel the whole thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can't stop the rover once the path has been drawn and you pull the finger off the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To see where you need to go press RADAR on the bottom panel.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Screen Resolution and stuff:<br/><br/></strong>The game is meant to be played on an Android device with a screen aspect ratio of 16:9.
