{"id": 51992, "slug": "qlorb", "name": "QLORB", "name_original": "QLORB", "description": "QLORB is a puzzle game designed to take the simplicity of games like tetris and deconstruct it into something familiar but different.  With QLORB, 2 sets of blocks must merge into 1 perfect block.  In order for this to be accomplished the player must clear away all of the blue blocks so the red blocks have room.  Each level progressively increases in puzzle size and the puzzles are also randomly created.  With increasing size, randomly created puzzles, and multiple speeds QLORB offers hours of replay ability and interesting puzzles to complete.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES<br/>\r\nRandomly Created Puzzles<br/>\r\n3 Speed Settings(Increases Difficulty)<br/>\r\nProgressively Harder Levels<br/>\r\nSimple Controls", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/9056306e8b9a2e8518ef513ede6bf164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 49, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5001, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Dolphin Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VT Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
