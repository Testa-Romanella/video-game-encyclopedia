Each island has their own trials that you have to take on, some are about battle, some wits. After collect all the Emblems on the island you have the ability to take on the Grand Festival. Each island is different on how you are able to take on the Grand Festival, Aresu does a tournament style to see who is the best of the twenty contestants, while Agrias you battle the five best leaders in the region.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nThe Kemos\r\n<p>In this game you will collect over a hundred different creatures called Kemos, they come is all different shapes, sizes and variants. For example when you first start out your mother will give you Kohyostubi, they can either be found in an ice or fire varient. However there is also the elusive Hikari form.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nRegular Kemo vs Hikari Form\r\n\r\nWhat are they?\r\n<p>The easiest way to tell if a Kemo is Hikari variant is by the lumos orbs behind it. If you see the orbs behind it, that means it is going to a Hikari form.</p>\r\nWhat are the differences?\r\n<p>The major two difference between the regular and hikari form are that they are harder to catch, when throwing a Spirit Orb, a regular one has a <strong>3/11</strong> chance of catching one, while a Hikari needs to do <strong>two checks of 3/11</strong>. The second difference, they could have a two or three stat boost over the regular, causing them to be more effective in battle.</p>\r\nHow can you obtain them?\r\n<p>There are two ways of obtaining a Hikari variant, the first one is by catching it out in the wild. They will have a <strong>1/1024</strong> chance of spotting one out in the wild without boosts.</p>\n<p>The Second way is by hatching one from an egg, you have a <strong>1/128</strong> change of getting one from breeding two Kome together and a <strong>1/96</strong> chance of getting one if at least one is already a Hikari variant.\u00a0</p>\r\nSpirit Orbs\r\n\n<p><strong>Spirit Orbs</strong> are the link between human and Kemo. When the Kemo gets captured in a Spirit Orb their souls bond together which causes them to work together.</p>\r\nThe Islands:\r\n\n<p>On your journey, you will have the ability to go to six different islands, however there are three that will be crucial to your story. The islands are Aresu, Lichon, and Agrias.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aresu is know to be the wealthiest island and typically holds the most cities.
