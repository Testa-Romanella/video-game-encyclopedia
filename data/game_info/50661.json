Angered by the Humans actions, the Creator separated the two populations, assigning them their own respective villages and different languages. As a punishment for their ignorance, the Humans and Animals were then completely segregated and the ability to communicate was lost. <br/><br/>Although the balance between the Humans and Animals was in peril, the Creator passed a piece of his primal essence to a few select kind and honest Humans which allowed them to still understand the animals and to yield the power of the 11 Spirit Animals by taking on their animal forms.<br/><br/>As the Creator was bestowing the gift of the Spirit Animal to the few select Humans, elsewhere a dark and malevolent energy manifested. The Dark Lord saw this schism between Animal and Man as an opportunity to overrule the World with His darkness and evil. To accomplish his evil goals, the Dark Lord gathered the most corrupt of the Humans and promised them power of their own to rule the World if they were to supply Him with both Animal and Human sacrifices to feed this insatiable hunger for fear and pain of all living creatures.<br/> <br/>Now, the time has come for those few gifted Humans who bear the Spirit Animal to defeat the evil forces that prevail and bring light to the darkness once and for all. Your quest begins with your Tribe being attacked by the forces of evil, when many parts of the World are set afire, people are being captured and offered for sacrifice, causing much pain and suffering. As the sole survivor, unsure of why you were spared during the torment and massacre, your mission is to find your people, free them, and fortify your Tribe\u2019s village. The only way to defeat the Dark Lord is to summon the collective power of the 11 Spirit Animals, using their gifts and abilities to kill the Soldiers of Darkness and their armies of destruction.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a6a15887b6f92699b9ad529d6067fe3.jpg", "website": "http://www.spiritanimalsurvival.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["True Illusion Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["True Illusion Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
