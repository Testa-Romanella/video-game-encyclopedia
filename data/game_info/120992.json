All the drawings in this game are made by friends of the couple, some of them are artists and some are not, which excplain the diversity of style, the patchwork feel of the game (which is actually pleasant because it feels personal, if you ask me). I made took some of the background pictures and found the others on the internet. I also designed and coded this game. It was made in about 2.5 weeks, only on spare time while having a dayjob, in collaboration with the friends of the couple.</p><p>There is 3 kind of endings to this game bad, good and special.</p><p>The story is inspired by the day the couple did meet for the first time, at a comics convention. They were making amateur comics and were placed on booth next to each other, which is how they started to talk. As it was also the day I met them at this convention, I decided to make a game related to this. However, the story of the game have nothing to do with the real facts. No real names have been used. Only some characters design have some similar physical traits.</p><p>This game was not originally destined to be released publicly but I have been thinking about doing this for several years.</p><p>For this public release, I translated the game myself and in a short time. I assume that my english is very far from perfect and the talking is certainly looking awkward to native english speakers.</p><p>Feel free to send me comments, feedback and bug reports.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b007d2b99f9975e798834305bc6602ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Klaim"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
