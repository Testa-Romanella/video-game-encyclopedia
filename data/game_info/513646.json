Also, skeletons.</p>\n<p>Made for halloween! In like, two weeks, more or less. It's the biggest project i've ever completed, and the worst time to do so- as i'm kinda being pressured by homework in the last weeks of class. Oops. Never again.</p>\n<p>Move with\u00a0WASD and jump with W or SPACEBAR. Talk to people with E. You can talk multiple times!</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to my friends who helped me inmensely, testing and helping with sounds. Also lots of really kind feedback from people, messaging me telling me the thing looked cool. Thanks guys! You know who you are.</p>\n<p>Special credits to:</p>\n<p>Bauti777- Made the badass theme, once again, and helped with sounds!</p>\n<p>Porkalator- Showered me with sounds!</p>\n\n<p>I hope my kind of written humor isn't *that* bad, but you have been warned!</p>\n<p>Hope you like it! &lt;3<br/>-Stop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b962832b2a6959023ce17738d37cc294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Stopsignal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
