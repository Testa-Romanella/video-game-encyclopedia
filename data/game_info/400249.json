Hopefully it's the last that needs fixing!**</p>\n<p>Whew! We finally finished this kinetic novel..... two weeks after the Yuri Game Jam 2019 has ended... A new record...</p>\n<p>Due to our busy schedules, we were unable to release this by the due date of Yuri Game Jam 2019, but we still wanted to make it in even if it meant being late!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This year's story is a little more adventurous kind of, though it still packs the same cheesiness as our previous entries. At first we wanted an absolutely ridiculous plot and literally make a joke game. However, it ended up being tamer than what we envisioned. Due to the lack of time to work on this game, the game might be lackluster, we sincerely apologize for that if you find it so! We are so sorry if you find that it's a downgrade from our 2018 kinetic novel ; n ; As previously mentioned, this started off with a very ludicrous plot! But due to old habits, it ended up being cheesy and fluffy, our specialty!\u00a0</p>\n<p>With all that said, we do still hope you enjoy this year's kinetic novel! And please don't hesitate to leave feedback! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T05:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/317795359113f4da34d66fb67dfae583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TeamANPIM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
