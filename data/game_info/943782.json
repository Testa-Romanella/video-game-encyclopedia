In total there are 8 levels in the main game, each harder than the last, culminating in a final 8th level that will give you a run for your money! In addition to the main levels, there's an endless mode that you can access from the main menu! While in endless mode, you can challenge yourself, making higher and higher high - scores to see how far you can go! Dancing left and right through thick fog, escaping every object that comes at you, this really is one of the great challenges of all time! With a pure half hour of fun in the main game and infinite fun with the endless mode, I believe that everyone on this website will enjoy playing this game, especially if you like a challenge!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T05:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a37d84cbb4f0495b36985be18da533a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["slyasafox3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
