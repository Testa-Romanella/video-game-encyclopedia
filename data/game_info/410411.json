This will be fun\u00a0for anybody interested in a bit of a rhythmic challenge. Only one level was made so it shouldn't be more than 5 minutes of gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not own the art nor the music, I just found many of the assets online, animated them, programmed them and threw them together into this school project. If you know any of the original artists please let me know so I can rightfully credit them.</p>\n<p>Song:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqqc2FHf9Ug\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/403ce3971340b09939d42b370d8f19f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SonusLumine"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
