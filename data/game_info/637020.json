The world is going to get pretty ruined if you don't find a way to seal up that magic lamp by any means necessary! <br/><br/>Use the mouse to click on furniture around your one-room apartment, and drag whatever you find onto the lamp to try and delay the genie from breaking out of his tiny prison!</p>\n\n<p>CREATED FOR INDIETALES JAM #1 BY:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mr_Afroduck</strong><br/>programming - Godot<br/>sound effects - Audacity</p>\n<p>https://twitch.tv/mr_afroduck</p>\n<p><strong>HannBanans AKA Banana Blush Studios</strong><br/>pixel art - Aseprite<br/>music - Jummbox</p>\n<p>https://twitch.tv/hannbanans<br/>https://banana-blush.itch.io<br/></p>\n\n<p>Font: \"Alkhemikal\" by jeti on DaFont (public domain)<br/>https://www.dafont.com/alkhemikal.font</p>\n\n<p>KNOWN BUGS/NOTES:</p>\n<p>After finishing the tutorial, the first furniture object you click will sometimes not open.
