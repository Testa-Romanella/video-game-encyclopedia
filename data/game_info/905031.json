Windows thinks it's a virus:<br/></strong>I promise you! It's not! It's just a GameMaker executable, but for some reason Windows sometimes flags them as viruses. \u00a0To be able to play the game, <strong>you need to create an exception in Windows Defender for the folder the game is located</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2. The game plays too fast:<br/></strong>This one's on GameMaker, but if you run into issues with the game running too fast, <strong>you'll need to manually set your monitor's refresh rate to 60hz</strong>\u00a0and/or <strong>force VSync in your videocard's settings.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d683dca8b6b9dc5011fb8472be4cd1e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Socksmakepeoplesexy.Net"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
