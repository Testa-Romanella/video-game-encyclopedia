Well that is if you do count 'Sechab' which we tend to not. Anyway, back to Survive.<br/></p>\n<p>Survive at it's basic is a survival game in which you grow with the land and survive using nature. However there is the addition of the waves of zombies every night, determined to eat your brains who learn while you learn and gain more power.</p>\n<p>With the addition of a cute, colorful, voxel art style this game, in my extremely biased opinion is much much better than Sechab... And this was written with still only 3 items in the game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:39", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
