{"id": 3651, "slug": "sniper-elite-3", "name": "Sniper Elite 3", "name_original": "Sniper Elite 3", "description": "<p>This prequel to Sniper Elite V2 is set three years before the events of the previous game, in Northern Africa during the World War II. The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.<br />\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne\u2019s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind. A unique targeting system allows you to see where your bullet will hit the enemy\u2019s body or a vehicle and the amount of damage it can deal. Fairburne can also use other types of guns, as well as explosives. Kills earn the player the points that push your character towards higher ranks. Besides the story mode, there\u2019s a co-op mode and five multiplayer modes, including the classic deathmatch and \u201ccapture the flag\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2014-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fe6/fe68940746007261e34da4d9cce81423.jpg", "website": "http://www.rebellion.co.uk/games/sniper-elite-3", "rating": 3.52, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 184, "owned": 2973, "beaten": 345, "toplay": 72, "dropped": 231, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 611, "ratings_count": 491, "suggestions_count": 602, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 496, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["505 Games", "Rebellion"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["505 Games", "Rebellion"], "esrb_rating": null}
