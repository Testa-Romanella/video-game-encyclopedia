Combine a wide variety of skills and abilities to unleash dazzling combo attacks.<br />\nBright Memory: Infinite is set in a sprawling, futuristic metropolis in the year 2036. A strange phenomenon for which scientists can find no explanation has occurred in the skies around the world. The Supernatural Science Research Organization (SRO) has sent agents out to various regions to investigate this phenomenon. It is soon discovered that these strange occurrences are connected to an archaic mystery \u2013 an as-of-yet unknown history of two worlds, about to come to light...About Bright Memory: Episode 1<br />\nDuring the initial stages, since it was pretty difficult to estimate the number of copies that would sell, I decided to create the kind of game that could start out as a demo and later use crowdfunding support to develop further. I\u2019ve finally managed to amass enough time and funding, so the action and general gameplay will remain as-is but the story and stages are all being reworked.<br />\nFrom here on out, I will no longer be developing Bright Memory: Episode 1 any further, but I plan on making regular \u201cexperimental\u201d additions of various new features, etc., which players will be able to try out. Once development of Bright Memory: Infinite is complete, it will be distributed as a separate game, but those who have already purchased Bright Memory: Episode 1 will receive a special \u201c100% off\u201d discount coupon for Bright Memory: Infinite prior to its release.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T11:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/137/137fea1c90714b6b65d81a0258ec2fa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 65, "owned": 785, "beaten": 119, "toplay": 83, "dropped": 30, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 131, "suggestions_count": 667, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 135, "platforms": ["Xbox Series S/X", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 5", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["FYQD-Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playism", "FYQD-Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
