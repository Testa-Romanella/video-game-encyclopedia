(GMTKjam2020)", "description": "<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Development for this game was poorly planned and there's still quite a few bugs! Fixing some of those would necessitate a complete rewrite of the game. As it's a jam gam, I just wanted it to be done.\u00a0Sorry for the inconvenience^^</p>\n<p>You are in DMV hell. Your mission : renew your car permit. Is it form C6-d1 or C6-d2?\u00a0Do you also need to fill out form A77-0? And where do you submit that? How much does it cost?! Oh no! It's already so late, there are so many people here now!</p>\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/arrow keys\u00a0- move</li><li>X/Y/Z - interact</li><li>I/E - open inventory</li><li>M - mute</li></ul>\n<p>Originally made for GMTK jam 2020 in ~22h (but not within the deadline!). The theme was \"Out of control\". The idea was that waiting in line and filling forms are actions that remove your control of the actual\u00a0action. I thought waiting in line was a funny idea to make into a game :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5ed1a7bad723553fb245dbe02aa29c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeSam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
