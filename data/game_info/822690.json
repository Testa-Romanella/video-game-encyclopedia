You can download a .zip or installer below.</strong></p>\n<p>Super Sharkie Boys is a side scrolling shooter game set in a world where 4 apex predators of the sea are turned into weapons of war. After years of atrocities, they decide enough is enough and set their aim on peace and freedom. This demo captures a glimpse of chapter 1, the escape. We find the Super Sharkie Boys deep in the depths of the Metropolis Rain Forest. They have just broken from their chains and are desperate to get out as soon as possible. Can they make it out in time? Or will the fall back into the grasps of Evil Dr. Golfino?! Only you can decide.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the demo is to get feedback on the general movement of the player, the art style, camera and level design.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Dekune for creating the Sharkie Boys Theme song.
