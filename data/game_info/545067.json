It will be simple, just connect all the blocks correctly to release some food for the cat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But why am I saying all these things to myself? I think I'm working too hard. I'll just solve a few more puzzles and then I swear I'll take a break.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's very simple, there are different types of blocks and what you need to do is move or rotate each one to the right position. I know! Have you forgotten who created this here?<br/><br/>And what\u2019s with this awesome song that you put on now? She is a very talented artist that I met online. Great, isn\u2019t she?!<h3>Main features</h3><br/><ul><li> No score-keeping, no timer and no pressure.
