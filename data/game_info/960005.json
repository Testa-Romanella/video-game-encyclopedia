What's worse: the Queen has gone missing in the chaos! Now leaderless and homeless, the ants of the farm are on the brink of starvation.<br/><br/>As a brave worker ant, it's up to you to scour the unknown world of the Living Room for food. You'll explore the towering furniture, interact with the local ant population, and lay claim to all manner of delicious bug snacks! Do you have what it takes to become truly IndependANT?<h3>FEATURES:</h3> <ul><li>A small open world rich with detail!<br/></li><li>4 delicious foods to find!<br/></li><li>18 weird lil' ants to talk to!<br/></li><li>20-30 minutes of gameplay, probably!</li></ul><h3>WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?</h3><br/>IndependANT is part of Young Horses: Free Range, where we collect our smaller side projects and release them for free!<br/><br/>This game is a tech demo we made to help us get used to the Unreal 5 engine. It turned out well enough that we thought fans might enjoy playing it (but not so well that you might enjoy paying for it...)<br/><br/>So give it a try! It's free, so there's only so disappointed you can be!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T00:57:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b17/b171498e4282846f197a8dbc2e8ca399.jpg", "website": "https://younghorsesgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 61, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Young Horses", "Young Horses: Free Range"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Young Horses"], "esrb_rating": null}
