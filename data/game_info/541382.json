First of all, thanks for playing our game.</p>\n<p>I made this game with my 2 friends Teno0 and Vico08lv for the Mini Jam 71 : Puzzles, it's a game that combines puzzles (mathematical one) and something like a roguelike and a turn based pokemon style. I didn't have the time to implement procedural level generation in the end so it's just a single level and your goal is to destroy all machines !</p>\n<p>Controls : WASD / Arrow_Keys + Mouse</p>\n<p>Tutorial : A fight is composed of rounds in which you have to fill (ALL) the slots with your given numbers and symbols to reach a certain number (you ALWAYS can reach that number exactly). You do more damage the closer you are and if you get a perfect (your number = wanted number) you stun the enemy !<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck on your adventure to destroy all machines !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T02:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab64ceb7a7382d7f431dfd458ae45893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thibazu", "Teno0", "Vico08lv"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
