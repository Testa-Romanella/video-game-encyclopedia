One line.\r\n\n<p>A round-based bullet hell for those that like their games just challenging enough. Enemies can only be killed by the laser in between the 2 boxes, but only one can be controlled at a time.</p>Note<p>This game is very bug-prone. A lot of issues occurred during development, and we didn't have time to fix them. The game will sometimes work, other times not. If it breaks occasionally, we're sorry.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><em>For the GMTK Game Jam 2021: <strong>Joined Together<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p>You\u00a0control\u00a02\u00a0boxes.\u00a0You\u00a0can\u00a0move\u00a0around\u00a0with\u00a0both\u00a0of\u00a0them, and\u00a0switch\u00a0to\u00a0the other\u00a0by\u00a0pressing <strong>E</strong>.</p>\n<p>Between the boxes, there is a laser connecting the two.
