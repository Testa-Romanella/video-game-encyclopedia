Their relationship is part of the game, where their level of cooperation depends on how connected they are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Join them on their adventures through the city of London and learn how you can overcome the biggest obstacles as a team, whether it\u2019s dealing with overbearing store clerks, or finding seats together on the tube. Experience the joy of doing even the most mundane chores together, and grieve with them when their arguments turn ugly and they are unable to work together on the smallest task.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project is still in early stages, and the future of it is still\u00a0quite uncertain. Any feedback or support is much appreciated.
