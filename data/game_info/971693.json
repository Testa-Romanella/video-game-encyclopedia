{"id": 971693, "slug": "destinys-divide", "name": "Destiny's Divide", "name_original": "Destiny's Divide", "description": "Dive into a challenging Free to play card game experience, meticulously crafted for competitive players. Play as one of 11 heroes, utilizing strategies with minimized deck RNG and enhanced skill expression. Climb the ranked ladders and assert your dominance!<br/><br/>The game has been developed with very open rules, not locking Heroes or Energy to specific cards, so every card can be played by all heroes. We do however have incentives in the form of \"discounts\" where the cards of the same type as the hero will cost 1 less. Additionally we do not prevent you from attacking your own cards or your own hero, unlocking some uniquely advanced plays.<h3>NOTE: This is NOT and will NEVER be a crypto or NFT game.</h3><h3>Unique Gameplay Mechanics:</h3><br/><strong>SharedBoard:</strong> A revolutionary concept that introduces both stability and unpredictability. Each player designates 3 cards; 4 out of the total 6 are chosen for the SharedBoard (two are banned), available for both players to use.<br/><br/><strong>Heroic Being:</strong> Ensuring consistency across decks. A chosen card, always revealed, can be played anytime resources allow.<br/><br/><strong>Energy Augments:</strong> In the deckbuilding process, select an energy augment that will change the way you play the game. <br/><br/><strong>Auras:</strong> Auras come in three different types: protection, effect and equipment. Further diversifying the gameplay each will work differently. Effect auras are static and provide effects as long as they are in the game. Equipment auras are on-use cards that can buff/debuff other cards on your command. Last but not least are protection auras, that you can pre-emptively place and they will trigger on certain actions.<br/><br/><strong>Transcendent Abilities:</strong> Powerful abilities present on the rarest and best cards, allowing for more variation in a single card, as the same card can have over 15 variations of abilities. These cards are never available in purchasable packs, ensuring no pay-to-win scenarios.<br/><br/><h3>Trade and Borrow:</h3>Bring authenticity to the online CCG world. Swap or lend cards with peers, with safety measures in place against system abuse.<h3>Game Modes:</h3><br/><strong>Casual:</strong> Play against random opponents or AI. Ideal for relaxed games or testing decks.<br/><strong>Ranked:</strong> <br/><br/>-<strong>Constructed: </strong>Face peers of your level. Climb the ladder with an ELO ranking system.<br/><br/>-<strong>Brawl:</strong> Build decks on-the-fly from all available cards. Earn better rewards with more wins. Unique features like rerolling card choices enrich the experience.<br/><br/>-<strong>Hardcore:</strong> A high-stakes mode where wins earn you opponents' cards permanently. The catch? Losing does the same to you. A thrilling balance of risk <br/>and reward.<br/><br/><h3>Rewards:</h3>Compete in ranked modes to earn exclusive cosmetic rewards. Top-tier players can unlock unique card visuals. All rewards maintain game balance.<h3>Seasonal Rewards:</h3>Each game mode offers end-of-season rewards like packs, titles, crafting currency, and more. Top players get unique cards exclusive to their respective game mode rankings.<br/><br/>Join us in \"Destiny's Divide\" where game strategy is valued above all!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T05:46:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a147a630894b65ffbf78721dd9521212.jpg", "website": "https://www.destinysdivide.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fobia"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Fobia"], "esrb_rating": null}
