First of all, i have to beat his peons, no wonder why he has like 20 thousands of them, they are useless, they only good thing they have is healing, they might make me a little bit weaker,but i can get over that easily, perhaps i'll be able to get some nice experience of what i'm gonna be doing while fighting them. Next oponent, their sorcerers, they have big life steal, but poor damage, hard thing is that theirs spells won't let me cast my forth healing spell, so, i'll be having a hard time. Yagh, the big dudes, i hate those guys, they just... stand there, i mean, wtf, do something.. please.. However i have to beat them too, the thing is that they have spikes comming out of their body, seems like they just sit there, wait until you hurt yourself, and then, heal, and heal, heal, kind of annoying.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tNext one, i'm not pretty sure what they are, but, someone told me that when they close their eyes, everything changes, it's like a reflection, if i attack i might be healing  myself, if i buff myself i might be debuffing him, my health bar might shows his,  let me tell you, it sounds pretty weird, but i guess i can keep track of everything by looking at the bars. After all that, i will have to fight with the leader, i'll try not to loose, trying is what matters.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t-- Key Bindings/Controls:\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t-- Bars(Controls)</p><ul><li>\" A \" - Your health bar</li><li>\" D \" - Enemy Health bar</li></ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDam, someone changed my key bindings, how i'm suposed to do now?
