For one bunny witch, this is a lesson  that comes with both its dangers and potential riches.\r\n</p>\n<p>In Witch of  the Warren, you will play through a short story about the witch Mochi  as she attempts to fulfill the potion requests of Mrs. Bunnerby. If you  are perceptive of what she\u2019s after and have a steady hand at potion  brewing, you may just come out unscathed! But if not\u2026 well, these  concoctions can be fairly unstable.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>In this game, you will experience a short story that consists of dialog between the protagonist, Mochi, and her client, Mrs. Bunnerby. Mochi will take Mrs. Bunnerby's order -- <strong>be sure to take note</strong> of what components of the potion Mochi mentions, as you will need them when it comes to selecting your ingredients!</p>\n<p>When you get into Mochi's potion shop, the game will proceed in two phases: <br/></p>\n<p>- In the first phase, <strong>selection of ingredients</strong>, you will choose five ingredients from Mochi's shelf. When the five correct ingredients are selected, a \"Start\" button will appear. <br/></p>\n<p>-  The second phase is <strong>brewing</strong>. During the brewing minigame, the center of the preparation circle will pulse with arcane energy. Every few pulses, the preparation circle will offer up an ingredient by showing its symbol. When that happens, <strong>quickly select the appropriate ingredient</strong> <strong>from the preparation circle.</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>A success will cause the potion to react -- but fail too many times and the danger of potion making will be clear!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p>\n<p>- 10/04 8:21PM: Fixed a bug where the ingredient icons failed to reset when successfully completing a stage.</p>\n<p>- 10/04 9:33PM: Fixed a bug where the success indicator text would fail to reset at the next stage.<br/></p><p>- 10/05 11:39AM: Fixed changelog to display the correct months...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:50:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["krummja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
