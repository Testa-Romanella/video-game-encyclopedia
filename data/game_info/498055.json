Legend says it's shaped like a never ending platformer level... Maybe you can bribe someone with the coins scattered around the level to escape ?</p>\n<p>Platformers Hell is a game created for the <strong>Potat0s Jam 4 </strong>(September 2020).</p><p>The theme was \"Enfer\" (\"Hell\" in english), so I decided to create a frustrating platformer that take place in hell.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>You are a famous 3D platformer game character, and like all of them, you died at one point in your game.<br/>Except that this time you lost all your lives, and you ended up in hell.</p>\n<p>Legend says that this hell was shapped to look like a level without ending, and with a lot of traps, but there must be an exit right ? Maybe you can bribe someone with those coins ?</p>\n<p>It might be easier said than done, it looks like someone is watching you, and laugh at your failures for ethernity...</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The game is hard and frustrating. (Ok this is not a tip)</li><li>The web version might be laggy/slow, just download the desktop version which obviously run flawlessly.</li><li>When you fall in the void you wont loose your progress, but you'll respawn at the begining of the level.</li><li>There are some traps everywhere in the level. Even if some can look like bugs, it's most likely traps put there on purpose. (Yes I'm evil)</li><li>If a box is in a anoying place just push it in the void, it will respawn at it's original place.</li><li>If a box is stuck against a fence at the end, just push it until it's not stuck. (Yes it works, I've tried)</li><li>Something really special happen when you finish the game with all the coins collected.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move :</strong> WASD / ZQSD (both works)</li><li><strong>Jump : </strong>Space (press longer to jump higher/further)</li><li><strong>Sprint : </strong>Left Shift (maintain)</li><li><strong>Crouch : </strong>C (useless but it's there)</li><li><strong>Main menu : </strong>Escape</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Engine : Unity</li><li>3D models : Kenney's Platformer Kit</li><li>Sound effects : Laugh, Explosion</li><li>Font : Chelsea Market</li><li>Music :<ul><li>Gathering Darkness by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3798-gathering-darkness\r\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T02:22:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1ed2a4f155373af476d1d1c8786c9bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Roucasse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
