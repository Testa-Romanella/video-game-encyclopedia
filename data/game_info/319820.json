It is currently being developed for Windows, and possibly other platforms in the future. In this game, You take control of Tay, as you travel through a fantasy-world/sci-fi world based on music. It&#39;s filled with music-related puzzles, characters, references to tons of bands/musical groups, and more. You also have the ability to enter certain characters&#39; dreams and explore their subconscious. The game has a fairly strong emphasis on humour, but the story is fairly serious.<br />\nIf you wish to support us with the development of this game, check out our Kickstarter-page!<br />\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dasshu/1542592811?ref=826164&amp;token=56841232</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T19:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e79e6080a4b444d8a403628b980c13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boot-Cat Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
