I remember those days when I used to play like that, \"If only I could fly freely in that sky...\" This is a hard-action adventure game that should be played while holding on to the memories of those days of floating balloons with such thoughts in your mind.<br/><br/>This game is relatively easy among the LOST object series by KIMIDORI SOFT, so it is recommended for first-time players.<br/><br/><strong>Game goals:</strong><br/>The objective is to manipulate the balloons and use floating and moving to reach the cactus and crack it open in spectacular fashion. However, when levitating, you use the air filled in the balloon. When the air runs out, the game is over.<br/><br/><strong>Feature:</strong><br/>Online multiplayer: there are quick matches and friend matches, both of which you can enter and leave at any time. In Quick Match, balloons from all over the world are going for the cactus at their own pace. In Friend Match, you can easily play only with specific friends by using a single keyword. Up to 10 players can play together. Of course, you can also play alone.<br/><br/>Continuation Flag: If you place a flag, you can revive from the flag location as many times as you want. Yes, as many times as you want.<br/><br/>Beautiful stages: We sincerely hope that you will relax and have adventures on the stages of our graceful world.<br/><br/>Collection Item: A floating balloon needs a party hat, right? The party hat is placed somewhere on the stage.<br/><br/>Growth system: The more you move, the more the maximum air volume of the balloon increases. (The amount of air you can float at one time does not increase.) Let's float more and more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T02:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe4a7df85c45cbb014b3321aef7dcbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIMIDORI SOFT"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KIMIDORI SOFT"], "esrb_rating": null}
