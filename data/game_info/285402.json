It models a turn-based giant robot battle between the player and several AI combatants on a very simple procedurally-generated battlefield, with input handled entirely via a text parser.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a fun one to build, simply because I had to emulate a DOS prompt in Game Maker 7. It lacks depth, but it's fun to see the sorts of experience possible with a fully text-based game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/843e344a4e41d7249732dacef82d447a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gazza_N"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
