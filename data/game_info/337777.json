{"id": 337777, "slug": "atropine", "name": "Atropine", "name_original": "Atropine", "description": "Atropine is a puzzle game that is played in Jefferson City, Missouri.  The app relies on landmarks and monuments in Jefferson City to provide the information that players need to solve puzzles and escape.  Individuals that are not in and cannot travel to Jefferson City, Missouri should not download the app.  If you get stuck on a puzzle you can have clues texted to other people playing with you.  Only one of you needs to download the app, but up to three of your friends can be texted clues to help you solve the puzzles that will lead you to a way out of the city.  Don't forget about the 'hot zones.'  These are areas that where the concentration of nerve agent is elevated.  Entering these areas requires the user to equip the correct items in their inventory.  What are you waiting for? Time is running out.  Grab your friends, your phone, and get out of the city!  Atropine uses your location to allow certain aspects of the game to work.  If you allow Atropine to use your location in the background then you will be able to enjoy all the features of the game and post your score to the leaderboard.  If you choose to only allow the app to use your location \"while in use\" or if you deny the app access to your location then you will still be able to enjoy the game, but you will not be able to post your score to the leaderboard.  Karst Games LLC does not share your location information with others.  Your location information is also not used for marketing purposes.  It is only used to enable certain features in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T01:54:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a981764a4f2f9a5d7931ffdc7710d4dd.jpg", "website": "http://www.karstgames.com/atropine", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Karst Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Karst Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
