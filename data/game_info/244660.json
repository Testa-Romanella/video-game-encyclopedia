Now explore beyond just the mansion, clean out the infestation of the city, discover what is hidden within the nearby volcano, and ultimately find the person behind the mayhem!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T15:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/206/20640afd08ccc1bc00487000ce295bc6.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/m-o/mayhemm4", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logic Obscure Productions"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
