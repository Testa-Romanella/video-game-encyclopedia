Players have the option to play in Quest mode, where they have to collect a set amount of coffee beans to win; and in Freeplay mode, where they can run endlessly, trying to beat their high score. Players can customize their game experience by unlocking outfits, accessories, and upgrading the effectiveness of powerups.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was produced in a three month time period by a group of five students\u00a0at the Sydney AIE Campus.
