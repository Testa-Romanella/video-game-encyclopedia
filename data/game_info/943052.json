For pathfinding and fov, the game uses floodfill. You can only attack the enemies directly adjacent to player. Unfortunately I couldn't finish adding a ton of content to the game. Maybe once the jam reviews are done, I'll come back and add them! :) <br/></p>\n<p>The source code can be found here:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/pyroceper/7drl_2023</p>\n<p>Feel free to edit, modify and use them in your projects :) .\u00a0</p>\n<p>The code quality is a pretty meh as I was rushing to submit the game in time :(</p>\r\nProgrammerpyroceperBackground art<br/>ansimuzArt<br/>deepdivegamestudioArt0x72ArtanokolisaArtgtajimaPotion FX<br/>ppeldo\r\n<p>Thank you for playing the game!
