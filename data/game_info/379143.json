{"id": 379143, "slug": "chairmania", "name": "ChairMania", "name_original": "ChairMania", "description": "WHY?\r\n<p>Well, I would rather say why not?! <br/>I mean, you have probably played a lot of games during your gamer experience or \"gamer career\", but HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED AS A <strong>CHAIR</strong>? <br/>In this game you play a <strong>chair</strong>, nothing like an RPG or a First Person Shooter, it is no Battle Royal or Chess Game or whatever you know, it is a <strong>chair </strong>life simulator (<em>if you can admit that a <strong>chair </strong>can have a life... Yeah I know it can be hard to imagine</em>)!</p>\r\nWHAT?\r\n<p>So now that you know why I've created this... thing... Let me tell you more about what you are going to do there.<br/></p>\r\nObjective :\r\n<p>As a <strong>chair</strong>, your main objective is to let people sit on your plate... pretty obvious right?<br/>Allow Kennys (<em>Yeah, I have given a name to the guys (no female yet sorry :/) who want to sit</em>) to sit as much as you can. Be careful, <strong>more and more Kennys will want to take a sit</strong> and <strong>you will unlock new chairs</strong> to continue your mission!<br/>If <strong>3</strong> Kennys fall on the ground because you haven't put your chair underneath their tiny arses, you LOSE (<em>and you don't want to be a loser right</em>)!<br/></p>\r\nLet's complicate this a bit :\r\n<p>If the game was just about having the highest score when playing as a <strong>chair </strong>that needs to allow Kennys to sit, this would be kind of boring. So there is something more.<br/>There are <strong>3 levels of difficulty</strong> (<em>easy, medium, hard</em>), the harder you choose the more input zones there will be! Let me be a bit more precise.</p>\n<p>Easy Mode : Standard inputs in the whole zone (<em>ZQSD or WASD, you will be able to chose</em>)(<em>The zone is YELLOW)</em>.<br/>(<em>insert image somewhere here</em>)<br/><br/>Medium Mode : 2 input zones :<br/>--&gt; WASD (or ZQSD) (<em>YELLOW</em>).<br/>--&gt; TFGH (<em>ORANGE</em>).<br/>(<em>insert another image somewhere here</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Hard Mode : 3 input zones :<br/>--&gt; WASD (or ZQSD).<br/>--&gt; TFGH.<br/>--&gt; IJKL (Ahaha, things are going to get messy here you will see!) (<em>BLUE</em>).<br/>(<em>insert another other image somewhere here</em>)<br/></p>\n<p>As you may have understood, when you enter one of these zones, the inputs to control your <strong>chair</strong>, will change! But, because I am not a mean guy, there are <strong>obvious colors</strong> (<em>sorry for color blind people:/</em>) <strong>indicating the areas</strong>.</p>\r\nART?\r\n<p>I am mostly known for my artistic works? ... nope!<br/>I wanted to try Unity3D Art ... yes!<br/>Why? ... yes!<br/>Ok? ... yes!<br/>Nevermind...<br/></p>\r\nKNOW ISSUES...\r\n<p>The game is still in development so, yes, there are some issues I reported to myself... You will also encounter some problems, I am sure of it, so feel free to let me know what happened with a screenshot and/or a short description.</p>\r\nIssues :\r\n<ul><li>Kenny is blocked. His walking animation is still running. </li><li>There are more indicators (<em>top-center</em>) than there are actual Kennys looking for a sit.</li><li>I can pass through obstacles (<em>and invisible walls</em>).</li><li>The score is still increasing even if the game is over.</li><li>I still hear the sound of \"poping Kenny\" when the game is over.</li><li>When a new <strong>chair </strong>is available, the current <strong>chair</strong>'s input set is switched to WASD (<em>or ZQSD</em>).</li><li>The physics is pretty f***ed up (<em>Yeah I know, some strange things are happening sometimes... video games physics you know...</em>).</li></ul>\r\nHIGHSCORES!\r\n<p>What would be an highscore game without a leaderboard? <br/>(<em>Yeah, I know, I could implement that in the game, but I'm too lazy at the moment, sorry my friends</em>)</p>\r\nEASY :\r\n<ol><li>BiOniK --&gt; 1550</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li></ol>\r\nMEDIUM :\r\n<ol><li>BiOniK --&gt;</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li></ol>\r\nHARD :\r\n<ol><li>BiOniK --&gt;</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li><li>SomePlayer --&gt; SomeScore</li></ol>\n<p>If you want to be a part of this (<em>wonderful</em>) leaderboard, post a <strong>screenshot of your highest score and its difficulty</strong>. <br/>Please, don't ruin it, don't hack your score (<em>I know some of you will want to do that to get some respect but, you don't need this, I already respect you for reading this description till this part!</em>)!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85422886f8a17bb610b44bb916e24a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guillaume PERRAY"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
