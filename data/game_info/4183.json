{"id": 4183, "slug": "f1-race-stars", "name": "F1 RACE STARS", "name_original": "F1 RACE STARS", "description": "<p>F1 Race Stars is a parody of a Formula One simulation. It renders the F1 racers as wacky characters and their cars as karts.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game features drivers, teams, and races from the 2012 season of Formula One. However, unlike most simulators, which aim to represent the races realistically, F1 Race Stars is a humorous arcade game. The racers, such as Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton, are depicted as cartoonish versions of themselves. </p>\n<h3>Tracks</h3>\n<p>There&#39;s a total of eleven tracks based on the real Formula One circuits. They retained their basic configurations but were enhanced with springboards, loops, traps, and other unrealistic features. The circuits&#39; backgrounds also became comical representations of a country where the race is set in.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Although the game is a kart simulation, F1 Race Stars doesn&#39;t imitate the actual karting, either. It provides a fictional combination of karting and Formula driving experiences. The cars in the game cannot drift and slide. Instead, the game uses the real-world KERS system to give the car a boost when exiting the corner. The game features power-up in the vein of Super Mario Kart, and some of them are parodies of the actual Formula One elements, such as a safety car. Each team in F1 Race Stars also has a special ability, such as shooting at the opponents for Ferrari or a free boost for Red Bull.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "2012-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d50c74e2ed07e739bf95f0761598281.jpg", "website": "http://www.f1racestars.com/", "rating": 2.87, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 859, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 38, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 170, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 417, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 61, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing", "Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
