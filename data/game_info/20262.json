What seems like an easy relaxed journey in the beginning, is destined to become fraught with danger as you progress through the Parallel paths of ever changing light. <br/><br/>Bounce and roll through stunning colour changes as you drop through the levels, remember you always stay safe on the white. Avoid collapsing walls and ceilings, platforms on the move and shadowed shapes that will follow you to your destruction. With a simple one click/key jump system, you\u2019ll need fast reactions, cunning timing and nerves of steel to reach the safety of the Parallel checkpoints and save your game progress. <br/><br/>Don\u2019t be deceived, Parallels is a relatively chilled out puzzle escape platforming experience, but let your guard down and it becomes brutally hard to find the way out!<br/><br/><strong>Features: </strong><br/>- Tons of puzzle levels <br/>- Checkpoints to save your process<br/>- Easy on the eyes <br/>- Ambient Soundtrack", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc779df6e313764a44b6ca054440a703.jpg", "website": "http://www.risinghigh.net/Games/parallels-game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["RisingHigh Studio", "RisingHigh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RISING HIGH STUDIO", "RisingHigh"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
