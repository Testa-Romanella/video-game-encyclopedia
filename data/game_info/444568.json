Be careful, though, your missiles don't always fly straight.\u00a0Be sure to take into account the gravity of planets, the sun, and other celestial bodies!

The theme for the jam was, \"A matter of degree\". We set an additional constraint to use only surface colors for the models and to not use a single texture for the entire game. The game was created in our own Sphere Engine, which has been in development for roughly a year.</p>\n<p>A huge thank you goes out to Nick L. Carver for designing the sounds and the awesome music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/6992574f62fc04d00c778815aa532ac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coff\u00e9 Junk Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
