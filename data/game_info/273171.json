But here's a guide to the main ones that will inconvenience you:</p>\n<p>For some reason when you walk down slopes you cannot jump until you completely lose all momentum.</p><p>If the game is lagging, occasionally you will be able to jump through the ceiling, because the collision doesn't update fast enough.</p><p>Occasionally you can slide up walls. I have no idea what triggers this, it just exists.</p>\n<p>For absolutely no reason whatsoever, the hitbox for the hub word replaces the hitbox for the level. Fix this by reloading the page.</p><p>If you copy and paste a save code with less than 10 deaths\u00a0\u00a0your death count will multiply x10.</p>\n<p>Tell me of any other glitches you find in the comments! it really helps me to have feedback.</p>\n<p>CHANGE LOG:</p>\n<p>v.0.1: First upload. Stage 1 made. Save codes currently not working.</p>\n<p>v.0.2: Added start menu.
