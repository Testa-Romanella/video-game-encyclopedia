With city life, you can always take a strategic break from everyday of life. At the same time, this game offers the opportunity to improve the highscore by skillfully placing the components.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of Stadtleben you get a number of random city tiles depending on the difficulty level. One after the other, place these components on a free square field with a custom rotation. This creates and grows a big city, here you get points for high-rise elements due to the degree of difficulty and the height of the element.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After a certain number of moves, a random natural disaster occurs at the skyscrapers, this process repeats itself with a random number of moves. These natural disasters tear down the high-rise elements that are not protected from the high-rise elements above. The game ends when the number of components is used up.<br/><br/>As time goes by, you can view the night sky with the help of the solar system, which you can activate or deactivate in the settings.
