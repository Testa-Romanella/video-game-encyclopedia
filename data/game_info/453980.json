They preach freedom and good leadership, but practise abuse and oppression. Some wish they could rebel, but little have the bravery to do so, and those that do are killed without so much as a struggle.</p>\n<p>Christopher \"Boom Dude\" Wood is not one to be brought down by the likes of violence and oppression. For years he has planned his assault on B.A.C.O.N tower, the central hub for B.A.C.O.N's empire. He has dabbled in dark rituals and experimental science, achieving the closest a mortal can come to immortality. On consumption of his special blue mayonnaise, his body flares into a bright blue hellflame and his Desert Eagle supercharges and gains an infinite stockpile of ammo. Long ago he even managed to achieve a symbiotic relationship with his trusty gun.</p>\n<p>Christopher knows he can bring down the tower, but should he be so sure?</p>\n<p>Game Jolt | Soundtrack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T07:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/508/5084e78c0222ef3173136f12fd0085bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ugly Duckling Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
