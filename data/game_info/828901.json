These are normally made to serve a large amount of people but you're the only one awake.\r\nThis game explores the feeling of being the only one awake at night, walking around and seeing the quiet cityscapes and the freedom of wandering around aimlessly.\r\nPersonally, this feeling tends to be the reason why I usually sleep when the sun rises (should definitely fix that) - the feeling of time slowing down, the complete tranquillity.\r\n<p><em>The following was a submission for\u00a0RMIT University -\u00a0</em><em>Bachelor of Design (Games) Y1S2 - Project 1 (Trash game)</em><em>.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>All assets used are third-party assets.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Please refer to the readme.txt file for details about where you can find the assets used.\u00a0</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T06:28:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b88cf6db037b59bc1f63f584def5954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Annsswer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
