Scary as slender.. but not another slender-like! <br/><br/>First person perspective indie horror game. If you like Slender, or Eyes, you'll like it too. <br/><br/>A cool storyline that will make your skin crawl and make your bones shake as you play through. <br/><br/>You run away from home and steal your dads car. Trying to get some peace of mind, you camp in the forest. After having a nightmare, and seeing two large red eyes looking into your tent, the night takes a turn for the worse. Search an old, abandoned victorian house and try to piece back together the puzzle of what occurred in the house. - Bloody Paintings on the walls give you a glimpse into the horror that awaits for you inside \"Turn Off The Lights.\" Play this game if you like to experience fear and deep horrifying atmospheres. <br/><br/>Music By Rene Louvrier<br/>https://soundcloud.com/void222x<br/><br/>We're on Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook!<br/>@henrysorren<br/>https://www.facebook.com/pulphorror <br/>http://pulphorror.tumblr.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3e9626aa35d5f20adcfc8f9f7b5298.jpeg", "website": "http://pulphorror.tumblr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Henry Sorren"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Henry Sorren"], "esrb_rating": null}
