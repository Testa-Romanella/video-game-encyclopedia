As she tames the island by defeating demons in gorgeous, mysterious natural settings, she will also find a home in a mountain village, proving herself worthy of her title by harvesting rice and bettering the lives of humans. In addition to serving as a love letter to Japanese mythology, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an ode to the artistry of cultivating rice, and an engrossing simulation of the craft behind the agriculture.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-01T08:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/276/276161d772f7f3f9a4520f6e9698f8c8.jpg", "website": "http://www.xseedgames.com/games/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin/", "rating": 3.79, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 153, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 107, "dropped": 24, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 204, "ratings_count": 32, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 34, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Edelweiss"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["XSEED Games", "Marvelous USA", "Marvelous"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
