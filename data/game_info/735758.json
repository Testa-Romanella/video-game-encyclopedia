The game also includes a console to mess around with after finishing the game, or just being frustrated by thinking with portals!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some history:</strong><br/>Portal: The Flash Version started as a Flash project by Hen Mazolski and Ido Tal, back when Valve first announced about their exciting new game. We define ourselves as definite Valve fanboys, and we just couldn't wait to play the game.<br/>We decided to make our own version of it ourselves, just for us, as a side project. Little did we know, it turned out to be a very fun game to play even in 2D, and after some pressure from our close friends, we decided to send it out to the world. This is the result.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T07:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c47eaae9e6c550259f1abb683c86f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AMOGUS RED"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
