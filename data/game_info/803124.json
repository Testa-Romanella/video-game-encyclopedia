The terrorist attack shattered peace on Remnant, and the waves it caused still haven't stopped breaking on its fragile surf.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Kingdom of Vale</strong> has turned on its failed protectors, giving its Hunters the choice of either integrating in the Atlesian chapter or renouncing their role. <strong>Atlas</strong> has become increasingly protectionist and aggressive, both internally and externally. <strong>Mistral</strong>, broken by the hand played by its leaders in the Fall, has descended into civil war.</p>\n<p>Among the chaos, the students and Hunters of Beacon who wouldn't bow have relocated to a piece of no man's land turned city-state: the <strong>Royal Duchy of Peak</strong>. A state in name only, for its only ally willing to recognize it as such is the nation of\u00a0<strong>Vacuo</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Something may change, though, if isolationist <strong>Menagerie </strong>decided to break its tradition of neutrality. For this purpose, the flagship -and only vessel- of the Duchy's air-force, the <strong>Red Shark</strong>, is on its way to an ancient fort in Vacuosi territory...</p>\n<p>Currently used\u00a0as a stronghold by the <strong>White Fang</strong>.</p>\n\r\nDue to some of the Themes and Events depicted in this Fictional Story, it is intended for consumption from a <strong>Mature Audience</strong>, where Mature stands for:\u00a0having reached a stage of mental or emotional development characteristic of an adult.\r\n<p>This game contains elements of <strong>[NON DEFINITIVE LIST, GAME IN DEVELOPMENT]</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Violence</li><li>Death</li><li>Suicide Ideation</li><li>Trauma</li><li>PTSD</li><li>Panic Attacks</li><li>Racism</li><li>Prejudice</li><li>Disability</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p>- Experience the world of RWBY through a completely <strong>new </strong><strong>AU story</strong> of\u00a0grand proportions!
