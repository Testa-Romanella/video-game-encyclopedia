It is made using only HTML and CSS. There is zero JavaScript here at all. Most assets are draw with CSS directly.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy 80 levels of casual gameplay. Simply stay on coarse and you're fine.</strong></p>\n<p><em>NOTE: if you want to jump around levels you can access them at the bottom right of the screen.</em><br/></p>Missing Features\r\nDue to the limitations of CSS there are a few features missing from this build. Namely: a timer and maze fog. these features break other features of the full game sadly.<br/>To see how these features can work with CSS... you can check out a smaller version of this game on Codepen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T06:10:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58fb7702dc13679562f693ef9fadbc05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kitjenson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
