Its a verry simple game where you have to find the most many time you can the source of a musique in 2 minute. You can just trust your earing, so a good headphone is preferable. The game is made with Unreal Engine 5 and only use material emeter for lighting, enhancing with Lumen, so not every configuration may be able to run it. Thank you and good luck :)</p><p>1.1 : Add dark interlude</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014f1ac06a3ae38d35668bda0225931a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dracul13007"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
