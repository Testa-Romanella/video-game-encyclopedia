Break icebergs by clicking on them with 'LMB', or destroy them instantly with acorns by clicking 'RMB'. Dig for acorns with 'S'. Move left and right\u00a0with 'A' and 'D' respectively.\u00a0</p>\r\nIcebergs\r\n\n<p>Icebergs are randomly generated, and have a random amount of health from 1 - 50. Breaking them grows the Spring area\u00a0based on how much health the iceberg had. By using an acorn you can destroy any iceberg in one click (Using 'RMB').</p>\r\nAcorns\r\n\n<p>Dig for acorns with 'S'. Your total acorns are shown in the top left below your score.\u00a0 There is a 1/6 chance of getting an acorn, every time you dig.</p>\r\nCold\r\n\n<p>Going outside the sphere of spring, you will be faced with the cold of winter. Watch the blue bar below your character. Once this bar passes halfway your squirrel will be slower due to the cold. When it's full you will die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T07:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4c64146a0914571604f74d0aa272d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eviljake29"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
