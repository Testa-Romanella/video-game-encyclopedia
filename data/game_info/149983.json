Use your 'drill' to break up the rocks.<br/></strong></p><p><strong>WASD and CTRL/SPACE for firing (player 2)</strong></p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>After the apocalypse the (highly evolved/mutated) cockroaches reigned the razed Earth, developing culture, cities, a life, until one day being run from their cities by the last waves of the late Lypse. We join two cockroaches in an elaborate futuristic orgy/ballroom, the centerpiece of which is our version of The Last Supper combined with horny cockroaches. This room is high in a tower (cockroach built), of which the design is hollowed out in the middle for an impossible chandelier hovering in the middle. Our heroes are the waiters to this event.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p><p><em>David Tiegen - davidjtiegen.com<br/>Alice Iu<br/>Jarien Sky <em>- jariensky.com</em><br/>Justice McDaniel - tumblr - BookFace<br/>Nathan Cope - nathancope.com<br/>Topher Campbell - snapvids.com</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86bf10cbb272a5df14ee3bd5e34489ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Nathan Cope"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
