Sorry<br/></p>\n<p>Hey thanks for playing my game! This is my entry for the Darktober Halloween game jam. This has been a fun month for me and i feel like I've learned a lot from this project from different functions and somewhat (but not really) improving my pixel art but all in all it was fun. Again thanks for playing and Happy Halloween!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b29fb19c8477be0a6ebb062332d7f6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XDA ShinigamiX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
