Anyone scores a goal<br/>2. Every time 10 seconds pass<br/>3. A crowd member yells<br/>4. A bug happens when the ball gets stuck and you need to hit 'R' to reset it.</p>\n<p>If you don't hit the \"drink\" button within 3 seconds of one of these rules triggering the game will automatically make you drink double the normal amount. So you should try to drink every time you hear the bell sound meaning a rule has been triggered ( it's very pavlovian. ) You can also just drink for no reason... just like in real life.</p>\n<p>Controls Keyboard or controller:<br/>Move: WASD + Mouse/Sticks<br/>Drink: Left Mouse Click/Right Trigger<br/>Jump: Space/A<br/>Reset ball: R/Y</p>\n<p>Tools:<br/>Unreal 4<br/>BBC's new free sound library.</p>\n<p>Misc Dev Notes:<br/>- I really wanted to add a violently punch button instead of a reset button to get out of corners, but ran out of time.<br/>- First time I made an animation, the drinking one. Terrible looking but still yay for learning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/8078875dc92f87566452ca95f01449b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UltraRat"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
