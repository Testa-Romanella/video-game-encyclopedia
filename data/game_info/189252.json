No controllers necessary! Internet required.</p><strong>The WebGL version can be played at http://www.baconshark.ca/barf/ and has the latest version of the targets list since itch.io has a problem with downloading files from other domains.</strong><p>Each round, each <strong>clue giver</strong>\u00a0enters a clue for the given <strong>target</strong>\u00a0word that the <strong>guesser</strong> will try to guess. Clues are presented to the guesser in reverse order that they are entered. Clues can contain any words except for those already submitted. So try to enter your clue quickly!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update: Version 0.2</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Players reconnect automatically if phone sleeps or switches apps</li><li>Target word presented on tally screen</li><li>Use keyboard to start playing and select pause menu options</li><li>On game over, can restart game with same players or start new game</li><li>Desktop version can load custom targets</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I\u00a0edit the target words?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can currently edit the target words on the desktop version. Grab http://www.baconshark.ca/data/...\u00a0and place it in the following folder (replace YOUR USER NAME):</p>\n<p>C:\\Users\\{YOUR USER NAME}\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Afantom Menace\\Let's Barf Words<br/></p>\n<p>The file must be called <strong>targets.csv</strong>. You can edit it in a text editor but preferably a spreadsheet application like OpenOffice so you don't miss out on any commas. You should be able to figure out the format.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can place a plain text file in the same folder called <strong>targetsURL.txt</strong> that contains a URL to the desired csv, example being the URL above. Note that if targets.csv already exists, it will take precedence over the URL so delete the csv if you want to load from the URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can't connect anymore</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Are you using the old version\u00a0(doesn't have a version number in lower left of the title screen)? That has been deprecated. If for some reason you don't want to use the new version, you can still access the old version of the web client at http://www.baconshark.ca/0_1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afantom Menace is:</p>\n<p>Andrew Afan\u00a0- Programming and Design</p>\n<p>Emily Claire Afan\u00a0- Art and Content</p>\n<p>Audio provided by Zapslat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9571992e6d315c798c8a8ae534fc81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["atafan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
