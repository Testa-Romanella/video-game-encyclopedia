An informant claims that Opposition Inc\u2122 is creating weaponized robots designed to hunt down humans deemed high-value targets.  Whoever purchases these machines will have the perfectly designed bounty hunter, to carry out whatever nefarious deeds they so desire.  This information came at the highest cost, for our team and the informant</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>You are the most advanced infiltrator droid the Global Federated Alliance tax dollars can build.  Though you carry no physical means of challenging the suspected perpetrators and their machines, you are fitted with the most advanced hacking module ever created.  With your multifaceted communication array, you can focus on and take charge of many electronics found throughout the environment.  Use this to sabotage and create distractions to lure the Opposition Inc\u2122 Robotic Patrol away from choke points.  Opposition Inc\u2122 has recently developed a new level of quantum encryption we have never seen, this encryption is built into the Robotic Patrol however we do not think the technology has made its way to the day-to-day electronics.\u00a0</em></p><p><em>\u00a0Use your physical environment mobility equipment to navigate the facility and locate Opposition Incorporated\u2019s mainframe.  Here you must install the S.W.O.R.D. virus (System Wide Override Requisition and Destruction virus.)  The S.W.O.R.D. virus once in the mainframe will search the Opposition Inc\u2122 network for evidence of Robotic Law violations, as well as confiscate any corresponding technologies while rendering their local database inoperable.
