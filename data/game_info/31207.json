This first-person shooter emphasizes stealth and guile instead of massive firepower. You will sneak into the toughest military installations in Eastern Europe, and once inside, use your skills in thievery, computer hacking, sabotage, and reconnaissance to stop the madman. The enemy&#39;s Artificial Intelligence will react to your every action and use military tactics to track your position. In order to counter its surveillance, bunkers, tanks, and gunships, you will be equipped with NATO spy gear and assault weapons. If the odds get stacked too high against you, call in a napalm strike via your map/communication PDA.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2000-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T23:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/841/84141a40083c0cefd00f3e5463970084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 37, "beaten": 80, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 33, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 89, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 91, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Innerloop Studios", "Vision Park"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
