If you handle them right you might just get to their suppliers, the next link in the chain and eventually the slick businessmen who operate in the casinos -- they should have lots of information if you don&#39;t have to shoot them first!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T08:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9d6/9d6c565982e508f213684f4340b26e04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": ["Capstone Software"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Capstone Software"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
