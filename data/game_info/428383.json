All needless repetitive tasks are unceremoniously discarded. Instead, you get 10 actions that consume or convert 9 primary resources. Each turn, you (and each AI-controlled faction) get to take one action. The complexity comes from a dynamic world with many interactive systems.<br/><br/>The actions you can take:<br/><ul><li>Respond to foreign invasions and natural calamities.<br/></li><li>Trade one resource for another.<br/></li><li>Recruit soldiers or labourers from your population.<br/></li><li>Nurture a city to boost its production.<br/></li><li>Steal resources from your neighbours.<br/></li><li>Infiltrate cities in preparation for an attack.<br/></li><li>Capture foreign cities by force.<br/></li><li>Negotiate to induce cities to join you peacefully.<br/></li><li>Build or restore unique landmarks.<br/></li><li>Excavate in search of resources and unique relics.</li></ul><br/>Some example considerations that you'll need to juggle:<br/><ul><li>Each of the 32 playable factions has asymmetric starting conditions and unique goals.<br/></li><li>Cities are populated by various combinations of different cultures, which produce and require different resources.<br/></li><li>Actions affect relations with AI-controlled factions, which modify how they act toward you.<br/></li><li>There are no formal truces or alliances, and any faction can attack any other faction at any time (with a few story-related exceptions).<br/></li><li>Some cities are subaquatic, and require a different resource to capture or raid.<br/></li><li>Cities can be affected by random or circumstance-driven events.<br/></li><li>52 unique landmarks can be built or restored to give a powerful bonus.<br/></li><li>A faction's capital cannot be relocated, and losing it destroys the faction entirely.<br/></li><li>Capturing another faction's capital lets you seize any relics they own, which are otherwise random finds.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T15:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a18fc4306715a80ead00b0317ebb21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 16, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
