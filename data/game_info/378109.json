If you fall too far behind, you lose the round and respawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Motor Moon was made for the 2019 Indie Galactic Space Jam held by Space Florida, NASA, SpaceX, and Indienomicon. Its focus is wide range accessibility and play-ability: a custom game pad was made without a joy stick for players who don't have fine motor control skills, a separate version for Planetarium screens was made in homage to our hosts the Orlando Science Center. Any planetarium can play a separate version of the game without warping.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/7133bbdb529acfae59f81bd55b8b8475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ashwood"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
