{"id": 923118, "slug": "violet-wisteria", "name": "Violet Wisteria", "name_original": "Violet Wisteria", "description": "Violet Wisteria sees the return of Japanese style 80s and 90s fantasy platformers as you take control of Wisteria Asagiri to save not only Earth but the Higher Realm and Under-Realms as well. Master the 3 color attack system to overcome a myriad of obstacles and enemies. Travel across multiple dimensions to thwart the wizard Maskandes' sinister plot. With presentation inspired by heroine platformers like Valis and Alisia Dragoon, and gameplay influenced by classics like Silhouette Mirage and Ikaruga, only the most determined will be able to see the heart wrenching finale.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nViolet Wisteria's claim to fame is its tri-color attack gimmick, which can be likened to rock-scissors-paper but with colors instead of symbols. Wisteria can execute three different colored sword attacks, and enemies appear at random in palette swaps of the same three colors. Learning to use the correct color attack against the correct color enemy is key to progressing, and stage obstacles will also require using this attack system in a variety of ways. This isn't a game where you can just start mashing buttons and perform melee combos, it requires precision and quick judgements. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith 8 stages of carefully crafted platforming and intricate boss fights, Violet Wisteria will present just the right challenge for those looking for a fresh take on a tried and true genre. Immerse yourself in the 16 bit aesthetic and remember a time when video games were pure magic.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T04:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d0bf27217deaf9783891c9b749f04f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kanipro Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Kanipro Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
