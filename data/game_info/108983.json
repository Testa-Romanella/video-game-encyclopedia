In this in-depth fast paced puzzle game,\u00a0you manipulate fire, plant and water to convert the board into combos which you can use to make your attacks.</p>\n\n<p>You can set fire to plants, put them out with water, and then grow more plants in the water. If you drag over 3 of the same element, you can attack a monster - but monsters are only vulnerable to certain elements! Quick thinking and dexterity is required to make the most of your score multiplier to reach the highest score possible - or try and survive for as long as possible by going through wave after wave.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made by two friends who put work into it whenever they could. It took way, way longer than expected, which should be expected when you can't work full time on something - but it was an awesome learning experience and we're both really proud of it.</p>\n\n<p>Dylan and David are both available to work for hire, both remotely and physically (they are based in Brisbane, Australia but might move for the right job.)</p>\n<p>Dylan's details:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>dylan@honeyvalegames.com</li><li>@WraithDrof</li><li>LinkedIn</li></ul>\n<p>David's details:</p>\n<ul><li>davidupcher@gmail.com</li><li>Artstation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/722301c159de1e47136e953a60bdc685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Honeyvale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
