Every 10 seconds a flash of lightning  will briefly illuminate your surroundings, but there is no time to rest;  terrible creatures pursue you in the darkness, and horrors lurk around  every corner. Can you make it home to safety, or will you perish in the  shadows?\r\n</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 51. Programmed in Python  using the pygame library. Artwork created using paint.net.
