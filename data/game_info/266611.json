On yet another day on the ice, Jobin bounces around collecting coins and other fun treasures while dodging explosive spike balls, some of which stick right to the ice! Enjoy the fun little arcade game taken from 'SCP Arcade' and turned into its own App, an App which includes several upgrades from the original (and the possibility for more!).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e82a857a03ce3ac37675209fd4d90619_lTOPpfG.jpg", "website": "http://www.smileycrewproductions.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Noah Wilson"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Noah Wilson"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
