Mission Control sends you on a mission to shut down the power plant from further damage to Europe.</p>\r\nDeveloper Note:\r\n<p>While I do want to advertise this game, I gotta be transparent in the way that this is a game showing off the dynamic pathfinding, allowing the user to input a string of text, then the AI's will build their own path to patrol based on that. I'm pretty pleased on how the feature turned out, but I\u00a0 don't think it makes for an extremely exciting game since I focused more on that feature.</p>\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n<p>The game has been tailored for 16:9 and 1080p, due to how the in-game radar works, it won't function correctly on another resolution</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:13:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b0623d134df4762780ee71bcbe5f8922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adde r2"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
