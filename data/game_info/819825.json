You also have another goal: protecting the dice.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful artifact that uses the power of randomness to nullify the exact results that derive from\u00a0the number ninjas' operations.</p>\n<p>One fateful day, a man by the name of Diceous stole the dice. You, as one of the dice's protectors, have to go after Diceous and defeat him before he starts to destroy everything.</p>\n<p>To move forward, you'll have to quickly solve math operations, while Diceous rolls the dice and sends you back on your way.</p>\n\n<p>This page includes a Windows version and a Linux version\u00a0(untested) of the game.
