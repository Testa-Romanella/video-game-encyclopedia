They were awesome and allowed me to participate remotely from Galway!</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out the other gamejam entries, there are some lovely things in there! (Maybe check back later when some more of them make it up!)</p>\n<p>--<br/></p>\n<p>I have elected to add a humble donate button to this game. You don't have to donate to play, you can still play for free.</p>\n<p>It's the first game/prototype I've released that has included it. I understand that the game is quite rough (1 day!). If you like the game anyway, or want to support me making games, now you can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03fa440dfc742296e3f08e54cda10985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Darren K"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
