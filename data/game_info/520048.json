We wanted to find out what was truly 'normal'.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Normal Man.</em> follows normal protagonist Norman Davis as he lives his normal daily life. What he does not\u00a0 know is that there are cameras recording and watching his every move, and broadcasting his life to the world as if it were a movie.\u00a0 His parents are actors, his hometown a set, all controlled by sadistic director Hector Wright, who will stop at nothing to produce quality entertainment. After all,\u00a0<em>everyone loves a good underdog story.</em></p>\n<p>The game is a text-based narrative adventure with psychological horror elements.\u00a0<em>The Normal Man.</em>\u00a0contains elements that some may find disturbing, such as death, self-harm, and violence.
