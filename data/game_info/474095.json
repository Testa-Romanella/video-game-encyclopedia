We had to create a 3D procedurally generated Diorama with the theme of 'beneath' and\u00a0with a minimum of 5 settlements and a number of procedurally of other items.\u00a0\u00a0I got a grade of 80% with this work.</strong></p>\n<p>for this I generated a cavern using Cellular automata, to generate a map then generated a 3D model from the verticies provided from the\u00a0 map and then displaced them using perlin noise to create an uneven ground surface, this also allowed me to create still water in the enviroment with a plain.</p>\n<p>once the basic structures of the cave where created I then started working on adding\u00a0 items. I used uniform distributions to place the objects, and validated them using both the position relative to the generated map, and factors like the height of the triangle it was positioned on in the mesh, allowing me to stop items from spawning underwater and that they appeared only where necassery, and where always grounded.\u00a0I used 11 objects for this each with they're own procedural elements like for example 3 kinds of \u00a0mushrooms, spawning at different scales, with rotations applied and deformation, so that each mushroom was unique compared to the others in the diorama. also with mushrooms specifically I generated them in clusters so that they usually spawned in small groups (3-8).</p>\n<p>(Video showing a generation test for mushrooms to check collisions etc.)</p>\n<p>for settlements I\u00a0 decided to generate camps, perhaps belonging to goblins or the like. these I generated radially from a central point , marked by a flag, then spaced them equally around a radius ( at an angle of\u00a0 no. settlements +1 /360)\u00a0 then displaced them away from the center so that the camps weren't even and where losely distributed around the center rather than ordered like you might expect to find in a perminant settlement.</p>\n<p>I also wanted some life to be present in my scene, so I added some fireflies operating on some elements of boidian behaviour, namely attraction and repulsion, (though not allignment), these where spawned at random points throughout the map\u00a0 during item generation and where constrained by a specific spawn location and a radius, meaning they stayed relatively close to the location they spawned in at but could still exhibit swarm behaviours\u00a0</p>\n<p>(The boid swarm above the 'water' used for the diorama, there are 30 boids in the swarm , with a radius uf 5 units)</p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed working on this and perhaps put a little too much time into it compared to some of my other assignments I had at the time, and am\u00a0 very happy with the overall results of the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/32409ef0d352da2e4743089695a3e264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K jesson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
