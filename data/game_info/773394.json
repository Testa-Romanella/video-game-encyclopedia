Or with a bang. Or an asteroid smashing against the Earth. It came with a flash, and when that bright light faded, everything ceased to be.\r\n</p>\n<p>The main character (of your own naming) awakens to find himself in the <strong>Interim</strong>, a realm that exists between the old world and the new. Before long, he runs across <strong>Mira</strong>, an <strong>Entede</strong>--a metaphysical being sent to aid him. From her, he learns that he's there to assist those who've yet to properly move on. As these lingering humans desperately hold onto memories of their former lives, he must help them come to terms with their existence, all the while learning about the reason for his own situation. <br/></p>\n<p>While <strong>The Interim Domain</strong> is actively developed and free to play, my Patreon supporters will receive up-to-date news, early releases, and bonus content. So, if you want to know and see more, check out <strong>ILS Productions </strong>and <strong>The Interim Domain </strong>there. \r\n </p>\n<p><strong>BE ADVISED: This title containts adult content of both a sexual and violent nature.   </strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb9cb8dfadc5aefa70780d9d95665f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ILSProductions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
