I looked for an idea within Japanese mythology and came across the Mokumokuren. These yokai live in torn\u00a0sh\u014dji. They are not a terribly complicated yokai, they take the form of eyes, and scare people. However, in some stories their effects are a little more brutal.</p><p>Your\u00a0sh\u014dji (Japanese sliding walls made of our paper) is getting old and ripped and Mokumokuren are moving in. You are worried your eyes might want to join them. Collect as many as you can, but be careful, miss more than 10 and you lose.</p><p>My first game, so it is simple, ugly, and kind of boring. It was built using libGDX in Java. I created all of the assets, except for the font,\u00a0Minecraftia which is available for free. As this is a TTF, I converted it to bitmap for use with libGDX.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd206e294a798a2a87e4b02d54db0e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PicoFoundry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
