Its essence is inspired by Lovecraft. Although the whole experience takes less than 5 minutes there are 10 possible endings, and somes are pretty hard to get. This is my first game in Twine and the first game that I made alone, in a personal game jam with myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:43:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a6/1a66548ae6ea7ca3607704487128b9c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LAIRINLAIR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
