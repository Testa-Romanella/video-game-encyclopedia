Rotate and\r\n<strong>dash</strong> all around the grid, <strong>nullifying enemies</strong> quickly to <strong>increase your CHAIN</strong> while <strong>avoiding spikes</strong> on a mission as old as time itself:\u00a0<em><strong>beating your high score!</strong></em></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Colorful, easy to read visuals</li>\n<li>Simple and short but fast and varied action</li>\n<li><em>Reactive</em> chiptune music that changes depending on your performance</li><li>Change and disable game elements in the Options menu to make your experience as readable or as flashy as you want!</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>LEFT KEY\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0----- Rotate COUNTER-CLOCKWISE</li><li>RIGHT KEY\u00a0\u00a0----- Rotate CLOCKWISE</li><li>X / C / Z / V\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0----- Dash to opposite side (opposite point on triangle and pentagon)</li><li>RETURN / P ----- Pause + secondary options</li></ul>\r\nTips and tricks:\r\n<ul><li>Every time you dash, a tiny bit of your CHAIN timer refills! Dash around the grid quickly instead of rotating to keep your CHAIN going!</li><li>Spikes explode after some time. This clears the way for you AND it blows up nearby enemies in the process!</li><li>Clear the board in a single carefully-timed\u00a0dash to earn bonus points!</li><li>If you nullify an enemy before hitting the spike, you also destroy the spike. This is called a <em>Spike Skip</em>, and it's worth bonus points, too!</li></ul>\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\n<p>Gruber for the music in\u00a0PICO-8 Tunes Vol. II.
