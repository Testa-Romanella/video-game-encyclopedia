Each chunk's generation is done in seperate threads. Textures are stored in texture arrays instead of tile maps, so new textures are added easily and avoid box border problem. While chunk meshing aren't multithreaded, after biome generation is finished, they will be next. For chunk meshing, I currently using Mikola Lysenko's greedy meshing algorithm.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27f624f1e4527676004d807c4e5fd959.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["At\u0131lhan Emre Dursuno\u011flu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
