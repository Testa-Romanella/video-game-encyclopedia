Survive by managing the emergency power supply, monitoring the facility's camera system for threats and blocking the paths of oncoming horrors. The mobile task force unit Nine-Tailed Fox is on its way to rescue you and other survivors.<br/><br/>With official scenarios and customizable difficulty levels, the game offers full control over your experience. The game offers 2 different zones that the player can play: the Light Containment Zone and the Heavy Containment Zone. <br/><br/>The Light Containment Zone is primarily used for containment and storage, mostly of lower-level SCP objects, such as SCP-173 and SCP-914. It is characterized by its high roofed, concrete architecture. <br/><br/>The Heavy Containment Zone is strictly used for the containment of high-level SCP objects, such as SCP-106 and SCP-049. Due to this, it is constructed with a distinctive rudimentary style, abundant with grimy tunnels and catwalks.<h3>Featured SCPs</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>SCP-035</strong> - A possessive mask capable of controlling anything it's placed upon.
