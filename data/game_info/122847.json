The game features twenty levels, starting off easy but quickly growing quite challenging. <br/></p><p>The main feature of the game is that you switch between optimism and pessimism to solve puzzles. The girl's abilities will be improved/restricted depending on which state you are currently in. <br/><br/>Alongside the basic OP/PS engine, there are a number of obstacles that both aid and hold you back. You must use them to their fullest potentials in order to complete each level. <br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>The tutorial is integrated, and you'll learn along the way. However, there are some in-game options such as <strong>B, N and M to turn on/off particles, sfx and music respectively</strong>. You can also <strong>press R to restart the current level.</strong> Escape pauses the game, for when you need to go do... other things. <br/><br/>Grief has two endings, depending on whether or not you complete a certain act within the game. Play time is about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on your puzzle talent. <br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>http://magnesiumninja.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/grief-credits/<br/></p><p><em>Original release date: April 19, 2011</em></p><strong>Post-mortem Commentary:</strong><p><em>Grief</em> was our second project, taking about a month and a half to develop. In the wake of the colorful <em>Bun-Dun</em>, we wanted to make a game that explored sadness. The concept of the five stages of grief underpinned the game, and we hope that it came through in the final product.<br/></p><p>Special thanks to Nik Sudan (http://niksudan.com/) for composing the soundtrack!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/5046fb2078f38c441d4a087c1067f511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnesium Ninja"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
