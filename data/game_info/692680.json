{"id": 692680, "slug": "bobok", "name": "Bobok", "name_original": "Bobok", "description": "\"Bobok\" is a kinetic visual novel based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's short story of the same name.<br/><br/><br/>1873. St. Petersburg. <br/>Not the most prominent literary man was dubbed in newspapers as a madman. His portrait with two phenomenally symmetrical and lively warts was to blame! Unheard of human stupidity surrounds the writer.<br/>Wishing to divert himself, he enters a funeral where he begins to hear the voices of undead people... Maybe at least they are smarter than living ones?<br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Unknown Dostoevsky</strong><br/>One of the most atypical and wierdest works of the great Russian writer Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (author of Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov). Black humor, satire, grotesque, and a cross-section of the author's entire oeuvre fit into a short story where fantastic madness goes hand in hand with documented reality. The game is great for those who want to experience the original text.<br/></li><li><strong>Glossary</strong><br/>The handy hint system prevents you from being confused by terms and easily fills in the missing knowledge. It is more convenient and informative than footnotes in books.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T22:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac2cf42e53bcd1ae7d7c006c409da7d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Secta"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Secta"], "esrb_rating": null}
