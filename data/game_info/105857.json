{"id": 105857, "slug": "subsector", "name": "Subsector", "name_original": "Subsector", "description": "<p>This prototype was made with lime (SDL, OpenGL, etc. bindings and build system for Haxe) and haxebullet (Bullet and Ammo.js physics bindings for Haxe) for the 5th GBJAM.</p>\n<p>All the time allotted went into building a 3D engine on top of them, and crafting an immersive space flight simulation. Unfortunately I didn't have time to add enemies or any other form of gameplay. I'll clean up my engine a bit and will be ready to open-source it soon. I also think this simulation is a solid base I could expand on to make an actual game someday.</p>\n<p>It was a lot of fun to transpose gameboy restrictions to 3D (2D purists be damned). The method I used (which I think is very common) was to draw to a small texture, and then upscale it for chunky pixels, and to map by luminosity all colors to the gameboy's palette. Such a small resolution and limited color palette posed a lot of problems for clarity, but I think I managed to make everything on screen readable.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ship model by https://twitter.com/quaternius</li><li>Asteroids models by http://www.blendswap.com/user/CGSky</li><li>Rocket thrusters sound by http://soundbible.com/1492-Rocket-Thrusters.html</li><li>Projectile firing sound by http://soundbible.com/472-Laser-Blasts.html</li><li>Shield up sound by http://soundbible.com/1682-Robot-Blip.html</li><li>Shield down sound by http://soundbible.com/1945-Smashing.html</li><li>Collision sounds by http://soundbible.com/308-Large-Thump-Or-Bump.html and http://soundbible.com/1637-Torpedo-Impact.html</li><li>Crash sounds by http://soundbible.com/1461-Big-Bomb.html and http://soundbible.com/1766-Fire-Pager.html</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b06be49c70e0b692fa64266eeabccf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Ohmnivore"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
