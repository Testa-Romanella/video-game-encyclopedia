The combat is\u00a0turn-based, and navigation is first person.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you attack the enemy first with your sword, you get to go first. If not, the enemy goes first.</p>\n<p>First you roll a D20 for if the attack hits. If the value is bigger then the opposing sides' armor value, it hits.</p>\n<p>Then you roll a second dice to determine damage.</p>\n<p>Rinse and Repeat until someone dies. If you win you get a bit of health back, and continue. If you lose its game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W: Move forward</p>\n<p>S: Move Backward</p>\n<p>A: Turn Left</p>\n<p>D: Turn Right</p>\n<p>Space: Swing sword while not in combat</p>\n<p>0-9: Type number for dice roll</p>\n<p>Enter: Confirm Dice Roll</p>\n\n<p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This project was written in C from scratch without any existing game engine.</p>\n<p>As much is done from scratch as possible, outside of audio, for which I used the library miniaudio. Outside of that I only used glfw to draw the window and opengl to draw individual pixels to the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a raycast engine, similar to wolfenstein 3D, this is just a very simple way of rendering 3d graphics.</p>\n<p>I used a tutorial by the YT channel\u00a0<em>3D Sage</em> as reference for the technical implementation of a raycaster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a1a2d8039de00a1b878824e4afbaea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rorybabory"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
