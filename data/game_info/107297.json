{"id": 107297, "slug": "accuracy", "name": "Accuracy", "name_original": "Accuracy", "description": "<p>This is my first game. I began developing Accuracy to learn more about the Unity Engine, so I can later create better games. After developing for over a year(off and on), I can definitely say that I have learned a lot. I am completely aware that this game is far from perfect, but for my first project, I am proud of it. After publishing this game, I plan to start working on <strong>better </strong>projects.</p>\n\r\nExpectations &amp; Goals\r\n<p>Considering this is my first game, I do not have high expectations. I am being realistic with what\u00a0I have. My ultimate goal for this project is feedback. Obviously I hope for my players to enjoy this game however it suits them. If it's for warming up to play another game, or if you play to compete to be the most accurate on the leaderboard; I am thankful for every download whatever the purpose of playing is!\u00a0\u00a0My future goal is to focus on modeling for my next project, so I don't have to use other peoples' assets:p</p>\n\r\nSystem Requirements\u00a0\r\n<p>Accuracy should be able to run on any computer. I recommend playing on a screen resolution thats\u00a01280x720 or higher,\u00a0otherwise the UI may look a little funky. You can adjust your video settings before you hit Play on the game.</p>\n\r\nWhy Do I Need to Make an Account?(Gamesparks)\r\n<p>The account system is simply used for the online leaderboard and the shop. Online features are hosted by Gamesparks, a trustworthy platform that games like \"7 Days to Die\" use.</p>\n\r\nContact Information\r\n<p>My email is jcgamedevelopment@gmail.com\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan to be quite active on this specific page, so feel free to post questions in the comment section.
