Every street and address matches its real-world equivalent - but City VR is more than just a 3D map. It enables you to travel through the streets like a giant, observe architecture from up on high, zoom in to the ground or zoom out to the air, change lighting and weather, and take snapshots of the most unique city views that you can discover.<br/><br/>Empower yourself with a headset and free your spirit of directing the discoveries in City VR.<br/> <br/>Featuring Cities:<br/>[Available Now]<br/>- San Francisco, USA: Stand atop the Transamerica Pyramid. Walk to the Coit Tower like a giant. Sit inside the AT&amp;T park.

As Amber Garage\u2019s first artwork that, Skywand allows anyone, including cinematographers and those with zero drone experience, to create precise aerial filming plans in an intuitive 3D virtual interface, then have actual drone flights executed accordingly. Skywand eliminates technical barriers to achieve professional drone cinematography by automating the flight process and arming visionary filmmakers with a powerful and intelligent partner.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/793c1ba724abf4a394f546aa92fe7aa5.jpg", "website": "http://cityvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amber Garage"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Amber Garage"], "esrb_rating": null}
