Evil robot sharks, lead by orcas, are ruling the world right now.  Octopuses tried to protect themselves from the attack of sharks. Almost all of the octopuses were brutally murdered by these monsters and their technologies were stolen. There is only one last octopus left on the Earth who is smart enough to fight against these monsters. The last octopus on Earth, Mike (prefers to be called Octorobot), is on the verge of death but he isn't the one to go down without a fight. Mike uploads his consciousness to a robot. Unfortunately, he forgot to add proper arms to his robot. To his convenience, the monsters still have the octopus technology and they carry octopus weapons while invading the little remaining land. The Octorobot's goal is to grow his arms as long as he can. May also try to save the Earth ( to his belief at least).</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>W-A-S-D to move.</p>\n<p>L to end Mike's existential pain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T09:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c90df728f330bd6c046c2f1e1a9fc119.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["serhanturgul", "Orkan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
