This is all I could get done for the game jam but there are so many background systems running here that I hope to use for more later on. Functionality is a little buggy still, just don't end your turn after loading your dice without rolling them. Thanks for playing.</p><p>How to Play: On your turn you have 3 actions that can be used to load or set dice. \u00a0When you set a dice that has the \u201cSet\u201d tag, it cannot be rolled. Loaded dice will be rolled after pressing roll. You may only roll once per turn. Dice are tagged with a die type of defense or attack and will add to the corresponding total after rolled. If your opponent knocks your die around, it will change your totals.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917b350a11b7ce774dea4c18b2f90c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Ray"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
