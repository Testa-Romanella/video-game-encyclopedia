The atmosphere is not entirely hospitable to humans, nor indeed any Earth animal you know of, but the sensors indicate that something is definitely down there. Regardless, it's also clear enough that humans--or something like them--were here in the past. You wouldn't know it from the lack of anything in orbit around the planet, but sandwiched between several tall mountain ranges on the surface is the ruin of what might once have been a small city.<br/>\"There's some sort of energy signature down there,\" you tell the crew as the shuttle closes in on the surface. \"It's not entirely clear what it is, but it's well worth checking out, even if this place doesn't exactly look like home.\"<br/>The signal is not steady, whatever it is; it pulses, and the readings from the shuttle sensors rise and fall as it maneuvers between mountaintops and crumbling old buildings. When the shuttle breaks into a clearing at the center of the city, however, the signal becomes more steady. It's clearly coming from below the ground, directly underneath a spindly tower or statue of some sort that straddles the entire clearing.<br/>[ Plenty of places to land--take your pick ]<br/>The streets of what was once a city are overgrown with scraggly red and black plants, tangled vines and scary looking thorn bushes, but there's ample room amongst the flora for a safe landing.<br/>\"Sensors are clearly detecting life below the surface,\" you say. \"It's impossible to tell what. It's organic, it's mobile. That's about all I know. Probably not a plant, but no way to be sure. Could be intelligent, could be dangerous, especially since you're not armed. If you get into trouble, immediately run back to the shuttle.\"<br/>LEADERNAME opens the shuttle door and the crew heads out into the clearing. The undergrowth here is about shin deep, but despite the scary looking thorns you're confident that an atmospheric suit will be able to withstand whatever it comes into contact with.<br/>Beneath the razor grass and thorny weeds is a quite flat and sturdy surface, apparently made of some sort of stone reinforced with metal rebar based on your scans. Clearly artificial, but then the buildings and giant metal tower already gave that away. There are hollow spaces below, but they're more tunnel than cavern.<br/>There are still no better readings on whatever non-plant life forms might be down there. Perhaps the crew will be able to avoid contact entirely. That would be ideal.
