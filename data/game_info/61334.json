But for early access it's just a safe place to relax between matches.<br/><br/><br/></li><li> You can buy some equipment from our in-game shop \u2014 RAMSNET \u2014 and take it with you to the match. It's all about an in-game ramscoins, you can get them for certain actions in a match, by winning, looting or killing other players.<br/><br/><br/></li><li> We're planning to implement some unique mechanics for battle royale.
