It was never meant to be more than the fly swatter and flies. What can I say? People who saw it had ideas, I decided there would be \"a shop\"... then things got out of hand. Flies is the product of a one-man game-jam that didn't stop when my editor caught fire in protest. <br/><br/>I just kept programming\u00a0 willy-nilly with a total disregard for... everything that matters when making a video game. On purpose. This app is a shotgunned mess of random scripts carelessly thrown on top of each other day in and out for almost two months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are like dragging your nails across a chalkboard. What was meant to be a volume slider cannot silence the continuous, obnoxious buzzing of the flies; thanks to some other bug I'm simply not interested in tracking down.</p>\n<p>Frankly, you\u00a0shouldn't play Flies even for a\u00a0minute under any circumstances. If you do the hundreds of bugs contained within may cause your computer to explode; killing you instantly and making me regret not forming an\u00a0LLC before sharing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tested on:\u00a0</p>\n<p>i5-4670K, 8GB, GTX 980.\u00a0<br/>i5-7200U,\u00a0\u00a08GB, GeForce 940MX.</p>\n<p>There was no regard for performance whatsoever.\u00a0If you download this executable and run it, please speak softly to your computer afterwards.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb14de524a755f396e64e8c587d177a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flimflamgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
