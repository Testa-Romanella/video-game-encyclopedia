Join the expedition to the Nono Islands on a quest for long lost treasures. But be aware, the islands are far from uninhabited! The treasures are heavily guarded by the Nonos and their army - the spiders, the sharks, the jumping skulls and many others. And if you in some way manage to get past them, the hidden traps will get you for sure. Good luck avoiding the spikes, flying darts, sawblades and boulders. Good luck, that's all we can say. Good. Luck.<br/> <br/>This game is free to play but it offers in-app-purchases.
