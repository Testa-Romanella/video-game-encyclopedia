When you beat a face, you fight a new one until they're all defeated. Each face has a different attack pattern, and more health as you get further along. To move, you have to move your head as you wear any Bose device. Collect small suns and defeat the faces before they destroy you with water bottles!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programmer - Jason Gertner</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Music - Ryan Casey</p>\n<p>Art - Ben Aube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:31:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859b281186394cde65b37a1cd30b3d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["jasoonmargoon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
