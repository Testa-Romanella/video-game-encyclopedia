This is the third part of the franchise of the same name featuring a lot of DLC&#39;s.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The title features some stories to hold the player&#39;s interest during the play session within the story campaigns, but when one creates own campaign, he is not allowed to pursue any storyline from the main game.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The in-game locations are procedurally generated, so every iteration of the game&#39;s experience feels different. There are multiple ways to reach to designed goal \u2014 political, economic and cultural. One can build the system of ships in various ways thanks to Crusade system: fleet may be composed out of the little amount of small and strong ships or a hive of feeble vessels. <br />\nThe game size varies as well \u2014 one can create a little map to test some cultural features brought in the nearest DLC or create a vast 400x400 squares locations with up to 100 enemies and unfold massive space battles.<br />\nAs it is a PC game, the broad category of non-official add-ons is available called mods. One can practically turn the game&#39;s visuals and story into every pop-culture universe starting with Star Trek and ending with Pixar cartoons.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2015-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8ae83f70a0f2631d7123a5caca19ace.jpg", "website": "http://www.galciv3.com/", "rating": 3.52, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 145, "owned": 1094, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 37, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 204, "ratings_count": 65, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 65, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
