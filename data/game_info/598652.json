My name is Roberto Garcia and I'm the founder of the BlackThorne Keep gaming community and writer of the PARAGONIA RPG, a low fantasy tabletop RPG that takes place in a world akin to\u00a0 16th century Europe and Americas. I've been passionate about gaming and RPGs for all my life and studied Screenwriting, Cinema and Filmmaking.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to start learning Unreal 4, and decided to turn all my years of gaming and RPGing into something new: a BlackThorne Keep ARPG with next gen technology - gathering all the stories of friends and foes along these years of online and analog gaming to create an original electronic Action RPG.\r\n</p>\n<p>And that's why I'm on itch.io! Here I intend to gather the enthusiasts of this world and genre to help fund the project, while keeping a line open with the people interested.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>That said, it's important to make clear that this is not (yet) a product. If you decide to contribute to the project and buy the game in its current form, please understand that you're not buying a final product - it's far from that! The objective at this point is to gather a community to help bring this vision to life, and if you\u2019re looking for customer support or a fully developed experience, don't buy it now. Hopefully in a few years you will be able to get a fully realized product - no hard feelings!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Now, if you're interested in the project and want to help make it real, please do! At this point, I'm doing all of the development alone, learning code and buying assets from artists, and this kind of stuff is not cheap. All funds gathered here will be used to further develop the game and enhance it.\r\n</p>\n<p>And this is just getting started! I hope I can count on your support.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>BlackThorne Keep\u00a0Chronicles</em> is set on a new world called <em>Paragonia</em>, based on the RPG setting I've been working for almost 20 years. The setting we will be exploring in the game is\u00a0called\u00a0The Old\u00a0Empire, a region of the world where the struggle for power have divided a once great nation into several rival kingdoms and city-states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of the Story Campaign takes place in a place called the Black\u00a0Forest, named after a millennia old clan structure often called <em>The Blacks.\u00a0</em>Several of the known noble families of the current Sherath\u00a0Kingdom trace back to the original \"Blacks\" and are now known as BlackOaks, BlackStenius, BlackBriars,\u00a0BlackThorne etc, changing names and lands over the centuries. The Blacks resisted the first incursion of the empire, but were eventually conquered and assimilated to the nobility.</p>\n\n\r\nFirst draft of Black Forest - North Map\r\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>One of the planned game modes is a\u00a0Campaign Mode that will introduce the world setting and tell the story of the BlackThorne, a once noble family that fell from grace and is now gauging their way trough the opulence of The Old Empire.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>What Is the BlackThorne\u00a0Keep</strong><br/>The BlackThorne were once lords on the edges of the empire, ruling the region commonly known as BlackForest North. Their ancient castle, the BlackThorne Keep is now a ruin - a tale of pride and decadency.\u00a0 Originally built to dominate the region and keep the savage clans at bay, the keep was overrun by the Iron Helm clan, the very same savages it was supposed to master. Seeing no other solution, the BlackThorne Lord at the time sapped his own castle and destroyed it. Even though he rooted out the savages back to the mountains, it cost him his castle, his title and his family glory.</p>\n<p>Decades later, the Northern BlackForest is a place almost forgotten by the empire. The only town there is in all aspects a frontier town and works as a commercial hub for the folks that live in the region.</p>\n<p>The remaining BlackThorne live\u00a0now in one of the remaining farms of the Castle era - the lands that were not taken from their ancestral that destroyed his own Keep. No longer nobles, not yet accepted by the common folk, the BlackThorne live at the shadow of their glorious past - often recalled of their fall by the shadow of the opulent ruined castle at the edge of their lands.</p>\n\n<p>(WORK IN PROGRESS)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game in its currently state is playable, but it is in EARLY stages, what one could call Early Access. Even though it has a lot of its building blocks in place, it should be considered very heavy Work in Progress in ALL areas.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Current\u00a0features (Work in Progress):</strong><br/>-Melee Combat\u00a0<br/>-Open\u00a0World exploration<br/>-Horse Riding\u00a0<br/>-Quest System<br/>-Arena Game mode for\u00a0Combat Testing<br/><br/><strong>Currently being implemented:</strong><br/>-New Main\u00a0Menu system<br/>-Character Sheet<br/>-Local and\u00a0World Map<br/><br/><strong>Planed Features:<br/></strong>- Story\u00a0Heavy campaign<br/>- Game Modes:\u00a0Story Campaign, Free Roam and\u00a0Arena<br/>- Character Creation for\u00a0Free Roam Mode and\u00a0Co Op<br/> - Co Op gameplay up to 4\u00a0players (4 players in Free Roam\u00a0mode and 2 on Campaign Mode)<br/>- Loot and Resources (for survival gameplay)<br/>- Camping feature</p>\n<p><strong>**The list of planed features might be changed if any supervening issue arise. **</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Best Played On:</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0a61a0a186773b9315fc29996d8d2f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Limiar Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
