{"id": 62994, "slug": "mines-and-magic", "name": "Mines and Magic", "name_original": "Mines and Magic", "description": "This game is a fantasy themed tower defense with automatically fighting tower-like units and a significant economics component.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe units fight automatically, use their numerous abilities and decide which monster to attack. They are smart, you can rely on them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe success of the defense depends on the army\u2019s formation and composition. If done right, an army would be able to counter any kind of enemy attack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player can also help their army fight the toughest waves by casting spells, which can damage and weaken the enemy, or buff and heal the allied units.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpells can be purchased between the levels, as well as artifacts, that provide combat and economical bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemies are not simply tough soldiers, they have different magical abilities, they use different tactics, they unite in formations of different units to combine their complementary strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are more than 100 different units currently in the game, every one of which has a unique ability and fights differently.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe army costs resources, and the player's responsibility is to build mines and farms to gather different resources randomly scattered around the map.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMines can only be built within the player's territory, but every mine built can push the borders wider, so some rare resources will have to be reached in a tricky way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMines can be upgraded with resources to provide more income, so the player will have to think of the best ways to invest their resources to make more money. Resource management, strategic thinking and planning ahead will be required a lot in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut defending the castle is still the main priority. Enemies get stronger and stronger with every wave. Investing too much resources into economics might lead to a breach.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe castle might survive the breach. The castle can be upgraded to gain more damage, fire rate, HP and improve some other magical properties, to help it to survive any unexpected breach.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf all waves are successfully destroyed, the player gets the reward (resources and artifacts) and gains one more area under their control. Then they proceed to the global map, where they can improve the territories they control, to get more global map resources, which can be spent to research more units, purchase spells and artifacts, upgrade their units and open new builders. After everything is done on the global map, the player will pick the new area to attack and start the next battle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are 20 levels in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3ef3cf8785772a2bdcbbfbd75154ce7b.jpg", "website": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MinesAndMagic/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zolden games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Zolden games"], "esrb_rating": null}
