In each level, players need to reasonably command their own mech squad to defeat enemies based on different decision-making factors, such as the Mech Type system, Terrain system, Action Point system. Before entering a level, a well-thought-out combination of mecha components will also be an important factor in making combat easier. Once players win a level, they will have an opportunity to get new characters and new equipment, hence a diverse cast of mechs and various equipment can be used to make up of players' unique mech squad.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/955b0edbf02c1bd2cbde364e3b14cf2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["panzersheng"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
