Made in 2 days (not full, i got other stuff to do too). A survival game where one has a shield that can block any damage, and another has a laser visor to attack the enemies. Combine that together and boom you got a big fat ball that has both a shield and a visor (but moves slightly slower). This game was made in such a rush that there will be lots of bug like the spawn times (might crash the browser).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50bb5474ef5205bf10b9501d330ad95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jayden Kusuma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
