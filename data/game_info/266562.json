Designed and developed with a lot of help from my own two cats, Sonny and Cher!<br/><br/>CATCH GAMES<br/>\u2022 Mouse - brown, normal size!<br/>\u2022 Mouse - white, small!<br/>\u2022 Goldfish<br/>\u2022 Spider<br/>\u2022 Butterfly<br/>\u2022 Fly<br/>\u2022 Flea<br/>\u2022 With sounds to catch your cat's attention!<br/><br/>PICATSO PAINT APP <br/>\u2022 Select colors to paint with (you can freely choose between 27 different colors). You can choose to paint with just one or a few colors or paint with a combination of all 27 colors.<br/>\u2022 Choose between 3 different canvas (background) colors.<br/>\u2022 Select \"messy\" or \"clean\" painting style<br/>\u2022 Choose between 2 different \"paint helpers\" - which actually work great as catch games as well! <br/>\u2022 Save your paw painting to your camera roll (in the Photos app) and print it.<br/><br/>CAT MUSIC GAME<br/>\u2022 Catch the bouncing kitties to make them play their instruments. <br/>\u2022 The goal is to get them all to play at the same time. Which is not that easy, because these little Persian kittens quickly lose interest in practicing and start bouncing around the screen again!<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: To prevent your cat from switching apps while playing, go to SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL &gt; turn off GESTURES while your cat is playing!<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>I have tested all these games on MANY cats and although most of them enjoyed the games (especially the Catch the Mouse Game), I have to be honest; digital mice and spiders are not for all cats. Some just totally ignored the moving things on the screen. So don't say I didn't warn you : )<br/><br/>But I hope you and your cat(s) will have as much fun with these cat games as my cats and I have had developing them and testing the app!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a2bafa4b40648a1c7c6bb56476fcde.jpg", "website": "http://www.martinecarlsen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
