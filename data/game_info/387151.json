You're given a Bumper in the bottom-right. Click on one of the Launchers surrounding the field to launch the Bumper into it. It'll first move in the direction launched, then bump into a wall or another Bumper and start moving in the direction on the Bumper itself. Match three of the same colour horizontally or vertically to clear them off.</p>\n<p>However, as you stick more Bumpers, more colours will start showing up. As you score more points, you'll get Paint Cans to help alleviate that by changing any Bumper into any colour in play that you want. The game ends when every Launcher on the field is jammed.</p>\n<p>If you're playing the embedded version, you can press Ctrl-Alt-Enter to toggle fullscreen mode. Also, due to some weirdness, if you click outside of the game applet, you'll need to click the grey border around it in order to continue playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T05:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c05/c0582b25683144cd781d8da3f4e53b29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KewlioMZX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
