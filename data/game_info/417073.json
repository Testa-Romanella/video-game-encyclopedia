I have 5+ more scenes until the ending. Then, I can split endings to three or more depending on your choices in the game. I hope I get more time to work on this. It's infinitely more fun than my job. Thank you for playing. Have a wonderful day.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0Art by me,\u00a0 Texture from unsplash,\u00a0Sfx from freesound.com,\u00a0Unity game engine and adventure creator, music:\u00a0Worlds Acoustic I by Vireos and Parallel by Ross Bugden<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:52:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/5138d802a32edd10587536fec3546a9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nocshiftgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
