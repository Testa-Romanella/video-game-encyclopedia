{"id": 387038, "slug": "pit-of-the-pumpking", "name": "Pit of The Pumpking", "name_original": "Pit of The Pumpking", "description": "<p>This game was created with RPG Maker MV for the Crowntober game jam. This is actually one of my first games that I've made and I'm really proud of this project and the inspiration was the Pumpking from Terraria. Most of the art was created by me, however, there are some things that I have not touched like the music, animation and sound effects. Anyways this game is about a Halloween dungeon and the game is not that long so it'll take about a few minutes to complete. I didn't want to over complicate this project\u00a0since I found the Crowntober game jam half way through October,\u00a0so I just added a few things to make everything\u00a0different. The plugins I used were ,</p>\n<p>Yanfly's Plugins</p>\n<p>SRD's Final Fantasy 7 Menu Layout</p>\n<p>Irena's Performance Upgrade</p>\n<p>And special thanks to my brother who play tested the game.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys have fun playing this game. If people like this game then I'll try and make more like this. Also I will make a Mac version if it seems interesting to them. And feedback would\u00a0be good,\u00a0Hope you have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T05:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e39bc0f651f06dee3b4ac4e6b40418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plasma Spade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
