{"id": 14390, "slug": "neotokyo", "name": "NEOTOKYO", "name_original": "NEOTOKYO", "description": "<p>NeoTokyo is an MMO game in a cyberpunk setting of near-future Tokyo. It was created as a Half-Life 2 mod.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In the 2040s, a group of Japanese nationalists in Japan&#39;s military tried to overthrow the legitimate government. Although the coup failed, the government doesn&#39;t trust its military anymore. The authorities created a new special service named Group Six that acts as a combination of secret police and counter-intelligence and hunts for the possible future conspirators. There&#39;s a rumor that a spec ops unit called Jinrai conspires to repeat the coup and the two services feud for power. This is all set to the backdrop of a dystopian megalopolis, where people slowly become fused with technology and a larger political crisis in Asia.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players assume the roles of fighters in two competing teams. They engage in two multiplayer modes, one is a classic deathmatch, and the other, Capture The Ghost, is a variation of capture the flag mode. The game is played in rounds, and if a character is killed, he or she will respawn only after a round ends. </p>\n<p>NeoTokyo has three classes for characters. The Recon class is fast, wears light armor and can run without exhausting. The Support is the toughest class that uses explosives and heavy armor. The Assault class is in the middle ground between the two others. All three classes have to be used in a thoroughly planned combination. NeoTokyo rewards tactical thought and prudent gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac23df188d5c3f03d142ef69f7d2402.jpg", "website": "http://neotokyohq.com", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 52, "owned": 1159, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 537, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["STUDIO RADI-8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["NEOTOKYO"], "esrb_rating": null}
