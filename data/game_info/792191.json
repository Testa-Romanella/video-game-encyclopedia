{"id": 792191, "slug": "the-game-of-nemoroth", "name": "The Game of Nemoroth", "name_original": "The Game of Nemoroth", "description": "<p><em>The Game of Nemoroth</em>, created by Ralph Betza in 2002, is the most complex playable chess variant ever created. Based on a cosmic horror theme, standard chess pieces are replaced with new pieces exhibiting side effects and complex interactions with each other. Multiple pieces can occupy a square and check is replaced with \"compulsion,\" which can happen to any piece and to multiple pieces at the same time.</p>\n<p>Twenty years after the original game's creation, the first ever computer implementation of Nemoroth has arrived, complete with AI opponent. The move generator and AI are written in C++ and compiled to a Web app via WASM, with a GUI written in TypeScript. There are many areas for improvement in the speed and playing strength of the AI, which is currently the crudest possible alpha-beta search with minimal optimizations.<br/></p>\n<p>Read the rules.</p>\n\r\nChanges and clarifications from the original game\r\n<p>There is only one restriction that is distinct from the original game: the Go Aways always push in a fixed order, clockwise from top. This is a placeholder and will be addressed in a future version -- I've procrastinated on it mainly because it's a UI/UX nightmare.</p><p>In addition, there are a number of ambiguities which I addressed:<br/></p>\n<p><em>Can a petrified Human, pushed to the furthest rank, unpetrify when it becomes a Zombie?</em> Yes. This makes petrified Humans more interesting.</p>\n<p><em>Can a Wounded Fiend approach and then flee a Ghast in the middle of its path?</em> No. Passing over Ghast squares is against the spirit of how riders work, and inconsistent with how they interact with Basilisk or ichorous squares.</p>\n<p><em>If multiple Zombies are pushed on an ichorous square, are they all dissolved?</em> Yes. If only one Zombie were dissolved, it leads to the question of which one?</p>\n<p><em>What if a square with multiple Zombies is ichorated?</em> Same thing, they all dissolve simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>If a Wounded Fiend and a Zombie are on the same square and the Wounded Fiend leaves, depositing ichor, does the Zombie dissolve?</em> Yes. The Zombie/ichor interaction is both active and passive.</p>\n<p><em>A mobile piece other than a Zombie is compelled to move off an ichorous square. Is it a saving move to push a piece from an ichorous square to another ichorous square?</em> No. Pushing from a multiple occupancy square to another multiple occupancy square is not a saving move, and neither is pushing a piece from a Ghast square to an equal distance to the Ghast.</p>\n<p><em>If a Wounded Fiend leaves a square that already contains ichor, does the ichor stack to more than 10 moves or does it reset to 10 moves?</em> It resets to 10 moves.</p>\n<p><em>If a Zombie is pushed into an ichorous square containing both a Leaf Pile, is the Zombie dissolved or is it engulfed?</em> Dissolved. Think of ichor as covering the entire square while the Leaf Pile occupies only part of it, so the Zombie would come in contact with ichor before the Leaf Pile.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3f17b711a47f918dec3f6549f4996d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["azgoroth"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
