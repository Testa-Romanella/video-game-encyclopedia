The game is more a prototype and is unfinished. You move with the ASWD keys and you can complete the game by entering the triangle on the floor.<br/><br/>Note: There is some issues with sound. I wasn't able to replicate it on my end but it might still be there. It's mostly glitchy and inconsistent.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/37386b23e03b0f0725646871069775b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Team Isla"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
