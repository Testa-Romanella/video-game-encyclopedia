The scoreboard is not being drawn correctly and the textboxes disappear when you fly away from them without dismissing them\u00a0including the initial one\u00a0:P .<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b791f1ac569b6f8d45b60efe14c3638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Insaneoid"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
