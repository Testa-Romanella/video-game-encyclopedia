{"id": 525029, "slug": "francium-at-the-zoo", "name": "Francium: At the Zoo", "name_original": "Francium: At the Zoo", "description": "<p><em>\"Francium is a grotesque comedy adventure taking place in a world of robots, in a museum-city that can remind of beautiful villages of France in the old world, before mankind disapeared from the surface of the Earth. In this episode, new robots have installed a zoo at the border of Francium's Kingdom, and the new inexperienced king Roboto will do his best to learn more about their plans...\"</em>\r\nI developed it in 2 weeks from scratch, with a few existing assets (see credits) and all new ones (new robots, zoo, etc...). The game is quite short (15 to 30 minutes) and could contain bugs and unknown issues.\r\n</p>\n<p>Made with 3dsmax, Unity and Adventure Creator. It is my second project with Unity and AC, my purpose was to continue to learn it as much as possible in 2 weeks! I'm very happy that I could finish a playable version in time for the Jam. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay info:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move with keyboard (zqsd or wasd, or arrows)</li><li>Interact with left click. </li><li>Open or close inventory with right click. </li><li>Show options menu with Escape.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<strong>WARNING: there is no Save menu, it has been disabled in this Jam version because of severe issues.
