A place of art and science, wizards and warriors, beauty and romance, magic and technology, mutants and monsters.<br />\nAndor is our planet, a small part of which makes up the Shattered Realms. Around us is a vast desert wasteland, the legacy of an ancient Cataclysm that destroyed the once highly technological society that thrived here.</p>\n<p>In the Realms, life has taken hold again. You live in the City of Fayd, an old metropolis predating the Cataclysm. There are many ancient places here including catacombs beneath the city itself, and vast subterranean areas far beneath the surface!</p>\n<p>To the north lies a great range of mountains known as the Teeth of Shartan, it too, is honeycombed with caves. Rolling hills and grassy plains, as well as the great Inner Sea, lay to the east and south. The great forest of Grymwood stands to the west. Only the dangerous and forbidding Great Waste lies beyond these borders.</p>\n<p>A variety of creatures populate the Shattered Realms. The most common is the elder race: humans. Their forefathers lived alone in the pre-Cataclysmic world. Now, humans share the world with the aelfen of the forests, the highlanders of the mountain, the murg of the caves, and the drakin of the skies. In addition, you will meet wolflings, a race of shape changers that can assume human or wolf form; ephemerals, a race of noncorporeal entities and their relatives the mechanoids, a race of robots imbued with a spirit. You may even encounter those with the arcane knowledge of becoming a vampire. Besides these, the world is rich in flora and fauna; thousands of creatures, both good and evil, beautiful and monstrous, inhabit the land.</p>\n<p>The Realms are rich in magic, the existence of which became known at the time of the Change. Sorcerers everywhere ply their mystic talents in four basic schools: druidic, enchantment, necromancy and conjuration. Others delve into history to find the clues that would allow them to understand the most ancient of all magic - technology.</p>\n<p>Cybernetics, formerly a lost science, has regained popularity, since it provides humans with an improvement over biology. Psionics, the methodology of mind over matter, has also come to the fore, as those with great force of will seek to bend nature to their course.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:45:44", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Novalink"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
