An evil warlock has been chasing you through planes because of what he claims to be some incarnation dues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has referred to you, multiple times, throughout your lifes, that you are indeed several fractions of souls, and for this course, he has transported you to a hybrid world with two of your strongest incarnations. Being two characters can be confusing, but the sum of power is needed to claim success in this bewitched journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this actual life, you were known as Esen, a reputed programmer analyst, philosopher, and musician. None of this powers are for good use now. The last thing you cling to before you are warped out into the hybrid real is your old keyboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the process of the curse, while you are being astraly tossed into a portal, you have few flashbacks as you are able to remember that once you also were Oog, warrior of the tribe of Apaec. You are free to choose your own path to break the spell...</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>: Cleto Thar<br/><strong>Art</strong>: Google, DravenX, Redshrike, ZaPaper, Cethiel, Mariana Hern\u00e1ndez, Xinef thar, Cleto Thar<br/><strong>Programming</strong>: Xinef Thar, Cleto Thar<br/><strong>Game Design:</strong> Xinef Thar, Cleto Thar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b7718ff80455f748ab43bb8c8806b7ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Esen Espinosa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
