It was, indeed, a challenge for me.</p>\n<p>At first, this challenge was fun, I was ready to work every day on SPEEDSLIDE and solve any problem that came in my way. Unfortunately, one day (day 5), I realized something that could doom my game: it's October, it's autumn, it's school and... I'm in 12th grade. Furthermore, that means I'll have a ton of homework to do and lessons to learn for the final exam.</p>\n<p>On day 5 I got really busy with schoolwork and forgot to work on the game. That was the moment when I had to get my priorities straight.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I chose school\u00a0over the hobby.</p>\n<p>I skipped day 5, alright. Then I didn't tweet in some days, so I had to make double-posts (day 11/12, 13/14). Day 15 onwards - radio silence. Technically, from my point of view, I've failed the challenge, since the jam's description said to \"<em>get in the routine of working on your game every day</em>\". Was I mad about it? Of course not! maybe just a little</p>\n<p>BUT, just because I skipped some days and didn't post for a while, I still worked on SPEEDSLIDE. Finally, on day 31, I've finished (the demo) of the game, and I am proud of it, and myself! (and I also kept my focus on school stuff!)</p>\n<p>Here's the progress of the game, in short:</p>\n<ul><li>day 1: prototype</li><li>day 2: graphics, transitions and other functionalities - the simplest form of the game</li><li>day 3: more levels, (an inaccurate) stopwatch and other small, fancy details (outlines)</li><li>day 4: trying to implement color palette customization (failed)</li><li>day 5: SKIPPED</li><li>day 6: title teaser and menu</li><li>day 7: title reveal, and breakable block</li><li>day 8: trying to implement color palette customization, again - made all the sprites grayscaled</li><li>day 9: color palette customization implemented! The player can now change the colors of the cube, the walls and the background</li><li>day 10-12: learned how to use .ini files and implemented the high-score system</li><li>day 13: SKIPPED</li><li>day 14-15 (in tweet it's 13-14 because I lost count): added music and sounds</li><li>day 16-31: SILENCE. I still worked on it though. There are now 20 levels on total, 1920x1080 resolution, invisible blocks, high-score table, buttons are now visible and some credits.</li></ul>\n<p>I've learned some things in this month: I made important choices for myself, I learned how to find solutions for problems and I found out things about\u00a0myself,\u00a0strengths and limits and the fact that I really shouldn't make any promises anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Anyways, fun challenge! I look forward to joining Devtober next year.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Ellian, for hosting this great jam!</p>\n<p>TL;DR: The first days went great, then school got in the way. I chose school over the hobby, and that's a good thing for me. I didn't abandon the project though. In the end, I managed to finish the demo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/95200bc7777dcdce5ccef57bf01af8e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creator Amator"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
