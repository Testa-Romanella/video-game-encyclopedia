Solve tricky puzzles and escape malicious traps. The difficulty is between challenging and easy. The gameplay varies between action platforming and puzzle solving. Touch other cubes so they follow you and direct them to triggers. Floating platforms will fly away if you don\u2019t pay attention when you are stepping off them. Move crates in front of lasers so you can pass. Use cranes and elevators to transport yourself through the level. But all these things are only possible if you avoid spikes, flamethrowers and enemy cubes that get in your way. The gameplay and controls makes it simple to pick up, easy to play and the different mechanics keeps you engaged throughout the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d7189507c3135ff737c74801b9d158.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
