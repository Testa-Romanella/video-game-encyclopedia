Think of them as rodeo clowns, but instead of wild bulls, they corral unsorted piles of change. Anybody can be a Fiscal Jester, which is why the competition is so fierce!</p>\n<p>Fiscal Jesters is a 1-4 player\u00a0puzzle game inspired by 90s upside-down puzzlers such as Magical Drop and Money Idol Exchanger. Choose a jester, sort your coins, and bury your opponents under an avalanche of skulls!</p>\n<p>Match coins in your pile to exchange them for bigger coins (ie:\u00a0group 5 adjacent pennies, and the rightmost one on the lowest row will turn into a nickel). Try chaining these exchanges to send devastating garbage rows to your opponents.\u00a0Chains are also worth more points in single player mode.</p>\n<p>By default, the keyboard controls player 1, but this can be changed in the settings menu. Further control customizations will come in a future build.</p>\n<p>Gamepad controls (Xbox buttons)</p>\n<p>LEFT: Move to the left<br/>RIGHT: Move to the right<br/>DOWN/RT/LT: Advance next row of coins<br/>A: Grab coins from pile<br/>X: Throw held coins onto pile<br/>START: Pause game<br/>Y: Open settings menu</p>\n<p>Keyboard controls</p>\n<p>LEFT/A: Move to the\u00a0left<br/>RIGHT/D: Move to the right<br/>DOWN/S/L/Z: Advance next row of coins<br/>K/X: Grab coins from pile<br/>J/C: Throw held coins onto pile<br/>P/ESCAPE: Pause game<br/>ENTER: Open settings menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T09:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f89/f89300704db93e61167b7a407535a07b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
