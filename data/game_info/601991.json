There are several industry giants in this business, so the competition is fierce; every company is trying to make their service the fastest one. Their competitive method is to use the algorithm of the software system to force the delivery staff to deliver the food at the fastest speed regardless of everything. Sometimes the delivery staff would have to violate traffic rules to meet their performance requirements, run red lights, drive in the opposite direction, drive on the sidewalk, etc. We want to make a game to reproduce these scenes because when people enjoy the convenience of express delivery, they can\u2019t notice the dangers behind it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/357ee5b33fb5d04a5b451bc74df9f461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["kylexiao"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
