This is my first attempt at a prototype of a fps trainer, that is intended to make your aim sharper. My vision for this game, is to be able to have a variety of modes, that range in difficulty etc. I\u00a0would like to in the future have a crosshair, sound effects and visual targets. Please if you can donate, I\u00a0would greatly appreciate it, and it would help me develop the assets for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34c/34cad76d9543249872ab64def78cc5b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thefirstcommonname"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
