I made it alone, and I was still going to school and all of my daily life throughout the jam, so it's really small. I learned quite a bit about how narrative is handled in games, as well as lighting and limited state machines. It was a good jam.</p>\n<p>Included:</p>\n<ul><li>Zip Download for each platform.</li><li>Source Code </li><li>Soundtrack </li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this won't run on new MacOSX updates. Nothing I can do about that, sadly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2e599e7ffddf1b24e10702c77440abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Enemby's Prototypes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
