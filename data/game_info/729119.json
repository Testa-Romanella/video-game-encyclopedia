Because of my shitty coding skills :D (Only way to get rid of it is by reloading the map (Starting a new game or pressing R))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767e6ff2380c8593b836154ed499fc49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Duck"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
