Outlander is an RPG game with an open world and a story. When discovering, you may come across many interactive things, whether with characters or objects. The game takes place in several areas, such as the village of Avoros and Golden Woods. You play as one sailor who crashed with his crew on their last great expedition. You are lost, alone and without anything. Your goal is to find someone to help you get home. And here it begins. Along the way, you will meet an unknown warrior, a witch and many others. After all this, you will meet a rescued carrier who knows the way to the village of Avoros and takes you there as a reward.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The game contains: </strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>- collectible loot like coins,food,potions and some items.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - interaction with NPCs</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - interaction with objects (make a wish at the well,sit,open \u2026) </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>- enemies (spiders and skeletons)</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - basic sword combat </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>- inventory with items/quests/notes</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - options with graphic settings,resolution settings and volume settings</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - multiple choices NPCs</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - tavern shop ( buy food,drinks,potions) </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>- rent a room in tavern (restoring health)</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - map of Golden Woods </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>- player stamina,fire damage and player minimap</em><br/></p>\n<p><em> - cutscenes - inspection mode / reactions / detective mode - and more !</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Music that i used:</strong> - I dont have any experiences with creating music so most of\u00a0 music I used are free (also free for commercial use), but some are neutral and want credits, so you can find them in ,,full credits,, in attachment. It's my first game that I made myself, so I would be happy for any positive feedback :) The game is not a huge AAA RPG as you are used to, but I hope you will at least like it anyway.\u00a0 I will appreciate the various support of this game and I will use it to improve the future of my games so that they are better and better\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bug that can happen:</strong> ( I don\u2019t know how to fix it )\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>1)First Quest: If you are really fast and you remove the sword from the chest, the sword may disappear. In this case, the game can be completed, but I would recommend restarting the game or killing yourself with fire/by enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>Graphic Card : Geforce GTX 960 and higher</p>\n<p>4 GB RAM and more</p>\n<p>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and higher / Intel Core i5 and higher</p><p><strong>Special thanks:</strong> Jimmy Vegas, Ferko Backa<br/></p>\n<p><strong>I will be grateful for any support you provide :) Enjoy Game !</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Full Gameplay:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn more:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Baki Studio Website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/15738f8cffb39e8bba09d4c30b16128e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["petulko04"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
