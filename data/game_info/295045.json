You\u2019re a cyborg at the wheel of an indestructible vehicle fueled by his own rage. You\u2019re on the grid of a short track, surrounded by walls, the race is about to start. I mean, you know that it\u2019s not a race, but you still want to be in the lead, you can\u2019t help it, it hurts you when you\u2019re not, truly. And since it\u2019s a fight, you should probably try to hurt your opponent\u2019s more than you hurt yourself. Hit them, make them rage, smash them against walls or obstacles, knock them out. There can be only one winner of the Road Rage Royale.<br/><br/><strong>Be the \u201clast Man Racing\u201d</strong><strong>Key Features:</strong><ul><li> <strong>The Rage Overdrive Engine:</strong> All cars are powered by their driver\u2019s rage, the more distance between the race leader and you, the more rage you generate. The more rage you generate, the more engine power you get, but more rage also causes you more damage over. Be careful. <br/></li><li> <strong>Speed based damages:</strong> On impact, the faster you go towards your target, the more damage you do. Unless you hit a wall, or something that tends to explode, like an explosive barrel for instance.<br/></li><li> <strong>No Guns:</strong> Your car is your weapon and your shield. Who needs a gun when you can hurl more than 2 tons of screaming metal at your opponents?<br/></li><li> <strong>Active skill:</strong> Rage also fills small reservoirs that and can be used to trigger your unique active skill. Use it wisely to make the difference.<br/></li><li> <strong>Drifty car controls:</strong> Metal wheels on metal tracks means drifty cars.<br/></li><li> <strong>Feel the steel:</strong> Isometric 3D hand-drawn cyber-punk post-apocalyptic art style. Few explosions, many sparks.<br/></li><li> <strong>Hear the squeal:</strong> Original cyber-punk post-apocalyptic (again) rock music is partially procedurally generated in real time.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37ab2b4158e596746d790c6952ea33c9.jpg", "website": "https://www.roadrageroyale.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neural Oscillations Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Neural Oscillations Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
