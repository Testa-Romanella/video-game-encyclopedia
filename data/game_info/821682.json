As a solo entry, and as someone who's only recently getting back into GameDev after a decade long hiatus, I knew I wasn't going to be able to do anything fancy with actual dice or game boards or anything like that. I felt the other meaning of \"dice\" (to chop food into cubes) might provide me a simplistic idea that I could deliver on.</p>\n<p>My goal in this competition was to design, build and, importantly, deliver something\u00a0I could be proud of, and I succeeded in that. If you've taken the time to play this game then, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. \u2665</p>\n<p><strong>Missing Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There's a bunch of things I just didn't get time to add, including sound (I was so close, but it just sounded annoying \ud83d\ude05)\u00a0and music. I also had plans to add a grappling hook (that's what the pointy knife <em>was </em>going to be) that could pick up distant food, and grab on to edges to help steer. We all know Mark loves a dual purpose mechanic!</p>\n<p>Folks who gave me feedback also had lots of fun ideas too! Once the Jam is over, I might revisit some of these and see if I can push the game a little bit further, but overall I'm happy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d2f0c13c1179cdd94bd93aae58d8f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gisleburt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
