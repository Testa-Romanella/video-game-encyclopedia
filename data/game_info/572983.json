Think of it as more of a demo than anything. Enjoy two and a half levels of 2D platforming. A and D to move. Space to jump. Left-click to shoot. Right-click to use your special. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be16860f2517ed589b55c10501a5b6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noremaxx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
