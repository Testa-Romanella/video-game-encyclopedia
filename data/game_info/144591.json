The manager, Miz, is also ubiquitous, she can go make sure everyone can do their work properly. Unfortunately, some workers steal. Some just slack off. But Miz is there to make sure that they are corrected.</p><p>Mushrooms are great for motivating tired workers. It even works for the Boss, who is apparently addicted to watching distracting things on his computer.</p><p>How to win:<br/>Kill anyone who is stealing.<br/>Feed mushroom to anyone who is lazy.<br/>The scoring system ONLY cares about how many quotas you meet. Doesn't matter if you kill anyone or don't kill anyone or how many mushrooms are fed. This is the system!! :P</p><p>Follow me on twitter: @swaggerzaki</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a45b66e2652d81cebf592578c7575d23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Hina Sakazaki"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
