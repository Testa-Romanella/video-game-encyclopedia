Another goal was to create the art myself, as i'm used to plunder the asset stores and websites.</p>\n<p>Due do that, the scope fell way shorter of what I had in mind. I spent over half of the time pixeling and the code consists out of 60% animation handling.</p>\n<p>This is the first software that i decided to publish, it's not where i'd want it to be, but you gotta start somewhere, right?</p>\n<p>Comments and feedback are always appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec002d2a96cc60945d69346060019cb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gourdy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
