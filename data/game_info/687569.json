Dodge past waves of bullets and throw your stick to the <em>chimera </em>to lower it's health. Beware though, while it isn't being thrown, it is vulnerable to attacks. Even when you aren't protecting the stick be careful with fire or else you may have to take care of yourself before the stick. This story is based on real <em>Greek mythology</em> with the game being based on other bullet hells like<em> Patch Quest</em> and our very first game jam game,<em> Lost Volcano</em>.\u00a0 Unlike though <em>Lost Volcano</em>, there is an end and multiple lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Direct <em>Meleager </em>using the mouse and click to throw the stick. While not holding the stick, click to run and use the mouse to play the game (when the game pauses)</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming and Music by Takago</p>\n<p>\r\nProgramming and Art by Miyaki</p>\n<p>\r\nProgramming by\u00a0Anonymous (Same as No, Stop)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4fff4107bc4bf8b87b4dd59633fa548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
