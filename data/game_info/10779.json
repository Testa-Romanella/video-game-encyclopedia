Players must complete quests by painting buildings and objects to progress the storyline. Sce\u0301al also features a day/night cycle with colour palettes and music that change as the story / time progresses. Playing as the little spirit, players can transform into an angel of light or a dark banshee, repainting the world as they move through it, changing the world from happiness to despair and back again. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlong with it's unique visual style and art direction, Sc\u00e9al has a distinctive and hauntingly melodic soundtrack, sung in Irish and made in collaboration with renowned Irish folk singers Lorcan Mac Mathuna, Aislinn Duffy and Florence Glen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/6265340bad13709e325e2e4adc76f71f.jpg", "website": "http://scealthegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 437, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joint Custody"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joint Custody"], "esrb_rating": null}
