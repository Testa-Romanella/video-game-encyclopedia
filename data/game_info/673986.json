With a 7 x 7 board and 10 colors, the player is given 2 colors each turn. The player may rotate and move these 2 colors how they like and drop them into the board. The player is shown what the next 2 colors will be. When 3 colors are connected (vertically, horizontally, or adjacently) they will all disappear and transform into the next color in the sequence (shown at the bottom of the game board). The player is shown what the next two colors will be, this can often change the plan for the current two colors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:15:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c13e172f68f825edd52e809e26e5fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andybeers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
