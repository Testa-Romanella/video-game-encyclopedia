The king's greed knew no bounds and set out to bankrupt his people by taxing their hard earned acorns. With no acorns to any of the peasant's names they grew angrier and angrier as each day passed.<br/><br/>On one cold dark evening, the King had sent his loyal tax man to collect the acorns from Charles DeMontequirrel who had refused to pay the unjust nut tax. As the tax man knocked on Charles' wooden door it swung wide open. Charles stood before the tax collector visibly upset as he was scolded for not following the king's unfair decrees. Charles could no longer simply refuse to pay up and wanted only to set things right. He snatched the legal document the collector shoved in his face and tore it to pieces. A call to arms was made and a skirmish set outside of Charles' house as he began his battle with the tax man and set forth on his rodent revolution upon the king and his men.<br/><br/><strong>Do you have what it takes to start a revolution?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7936245b34bb23bbe92b50075c05f97b.jpg", "website": "http://www.acornassault.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 93}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["High Tale Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Shell Media"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
