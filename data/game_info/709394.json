For every opponent you throw out from the arena, your hit power increases, and you hit harder. There are 2 unique abilities. \"Shield\" and \"2x Damage\". Once the \"Shield\" is active, you won't be harmed. With \"2x Damage\" active, your thrust is doubled. Each skill is valid for 10 seconds. There are 4 maps. Try each map and see if you can conquer the battlefield!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b871beee00cfb4bcdb0b3642fe2d92f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AYN Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
