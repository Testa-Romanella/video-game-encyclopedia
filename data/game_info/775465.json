You need at least 2 people to play a match together. The game is a 2D turn based artillery game. In each round, you get an increasing amount of money to spend on shells. You control the launch impulse and angle of your tank, and to a limited extent the movement of your tank. The goal of each match is to be the last tank standing after killing all others with your shells.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c9b6ff2689c208156a78bdc0c808ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pig Guy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
