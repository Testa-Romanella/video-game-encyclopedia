{"id": 536884, "slug": "canine-cafe-clicker", "name": "Canine Cafe Clicker", "name_original": "Canine Cafe Clicker", "description": "<p>In Canine Cafe Clicker you have opened a canine cafe so you can make money and have a lot of dogs!\u00a0Adopt and care for dogs to bring in business, upgrade equipment. Click buttons a lot!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2020 Secret Santa Game Jam where participants are randomly paired with a giftee to make a game specifically for.</p>\n<p>This isn't finished I bit off a few more bytes than I could chew and had to remove a lot of ideas. A lot of the graphics are placeholders I\u00a0never replaced and there is no saving. Hopefully in the coming weeks I will be fixing a lot of these problems.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Instructions/tips:</p>\n<p>-NO SAVING. Just want to make it clear there is no way to keep progress.</p>\n<p>-Click \"make coffee\" repeatedly to start making coffee. Wait for customers to come in and pay for finished cups.</p>\n<p>-Click \"upgrades\" to adopt dogs and upgrade your equipment/supplies (the plan is to have a lot more on this screen in the near future).\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-faster coffee = finish a cup with less clicks (upgrade enough and get more than a cup per click.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Counter space = need to get some counter space to put down finished cups or you can only make one cup at a time.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Better coffee makes more money per cup.</p>\n<p>-Dogs increase how often customers come in and how fast they move. They also increase the amount of money per coffee (if you keep them happy). Combining Better Coffee and happy dogs increases income a lot.</p>\n<p>-Click on dog to check and interact or click \"NEXT DOG\" to scroll through all dogs.</p>\n<p>-With a dog selected, click on bone buttons to interact with it.</p>\n<p>-Crappy thrown together mute button should be obvious.</p>\n\n<p>Couple debugging tools I\u00a0left in for now. Pressing #1 will make the faces randomly reset. Pressing #2 will erase all the customers (in case they get stuck or something. There is a cheat for making lots of money. Not gonna put it here yet. But might later. Prob will remove it entirely when the game works better.</p>\n\n<p>Dog sprite set from<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/husky-sprites</p>\n<p>Start screen music:<br/>Lobby Time by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3986-lobby-time<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>In-game music<br/>Airport Lounge by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3347-airport-lounge<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T08:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/2383c91367c9fb81b854073cf908cd0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobBoberty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
