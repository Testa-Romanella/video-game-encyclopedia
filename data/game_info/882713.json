It takes place after the world has come to the edge of extinction, covered by dunes of sand that stretch for miles. Air and water is controlled by a very small group of people named Sirgig, who ration it out to the rest of the populous. You are a prisoner trapped in a collapsing structure named the Stronghold, and must solve a series of puzzles to escape.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Gameplay consists of deciphering and encrypting codes. It centers around a basic concept of inputs, encrypting, and outputs. Each level has a piece of text that must be modified based on the hints given,\u00a0 and then put into an input object to continue. These puzzles range from messing around with the alphabet to binary translation. Nothing in this game is very easy, and takes a lot of brain power to figure out. You will learn to balance between simple thinking and complicated problem solving. But once you solve a puzzle, you will feel a sense of confidence and excitement.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c4044267c6f00b0afb479925fd4249a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Saucedbox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
