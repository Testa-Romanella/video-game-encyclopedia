With the excess energy and computational power, humanity built a matrioshka brain, which is a digital interface where humans can plug in and live out any and all fantasies until death.</p>\n<p>Saint Veronica, a family run organisation of guardians were tasked to remain and protect the sphere.</p>\n<p>This day, the Northwest hull of the topmost sphere was breached. However, the offending\u00a0object was organic in nature. Something organic with the ability to survive spaceflight unprotected is now inside the only Dyson facility humanity has ever built.</p>\n<p>Only one member of the family can enter at a time as their linage and the lives of just under nine billion suspended humans hangs in balance.</p>\n<p>Game Development by Starande</p>\n<p>Art and development\u00a0by Jetter008</p>\n<p>SFX and sound physics\u00a0by J.</p>\n<p>Design, story and level art by TehGameDev</p><p>Premade assets used -\u00a0</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/deadsillyrabbit/sounds/251390/</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/Andreas.Mustola/sounds/255764/</p><p>https://gametextures.com/freebies/97946</p><p>Other cc0 assets from -</p><p>https://freepbr.com/</p><p>https://cc0textures.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T08:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5f9de87c7e20c541a7b2eb96e84e9c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harsh Gupta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
