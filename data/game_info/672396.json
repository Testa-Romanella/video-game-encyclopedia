With the help of a human turncoat you have managed to infiltrate this invasion force at the very top - as the Overseer of the Figura Expedition. That&#39;s only where your job starts, however! Using your position and your shapeshifting skills, you must work from the inside to turn the invasion back on itself, helping the Expedition staff to re-discover their sexual natures, finding allies and neutralizing potential threats as you go. Carnal Coup has a heavy emphasis on gender preference flexibility, and the game will adapt to the relationships you want to encounter! As you proceed, you will encounter eight different Departments who make up the Expedition:<br />\nThe bestial Harians of the Commandos!<br />\nThe cybernetic Lencists of the Roboticists!<br />\nThe all-female Vessians of the Cloners!<br />\nThe psychic Celopi of the Secret Police!<br />\nThe reptilian Schen of the Scientists!<br />\nThe glamorous Vox of the Propagandists!<br />\nThe mischievous Maelish of the Pilots!<br />\nThe insectoid Roth of the Workers!<br />\nEach species of the Expedition has their own traits and, well, kinks for you to learn about as you infiltrate the Expedition from top to bottom. You&#39;ll also find unique Specialists to recruit to your side, Department Directors you must convert or neutralize, and Missions to undertake across the planet and in sci-fi laboratories. In the end you&#39;ll be able to choose the fate you want for your world - peaceful co-existence with the newly arrived aliens? Or will you aggressively infiltrate the Expedition, and claim its resources for your people? The choice is yours - but either way, you&#39;ll have plenty of fun doing it!About This Release<br />\nCarnal Coup has been developed over the course of more than four years with the help of many generous supporters on Patreon.
