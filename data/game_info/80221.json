It's very useful for building long sequences.<br/><br/>Each card taken off from the board has a value of 100 points, and if it follows a sequence then its value would have 50 bonus points. This means that the longer the sequence is then more points you get.<br/><br/>Solitaire Challenges doesn't only involves luck but the skill of selecting the necessary cards to solve the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d83b5afe84347eb195e877f1b46688e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jose Varela"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Jose Varela"], "esrb_rating": null}
