It seems to react to life on the planet. <br/><br/>There's nothing for you on this world so you jump into the shimmering portal and being your journey across the galaxy to find another of your species and uncover the *truth. (*truth not included)<br/><br/><strong>Notes: </strong><br/>There were going to be more plants and animal types and more planets but we ran out of time as usual. You were going to uncover the cause of the apocalypse and the origin of the star gates through paintings on ruins but that was cut also. <br/>The original story had ancient interstellar beings who built the star gates to travel between worlds but they uncover a plague that threatened to spread across the stargate network and wipe out all life. As a last resort they construct a super gate to escape to another galaxy but inadvertently triggers the disaster which caused the stars to fade and destroyed themselves. <br/><br/>Try keeping seeds in the air by head butting them :) <br/><br/>www.mechabit.co.uk <br/><br/>Music by Deceased Superior Technician </p><p><em>(if you like our games please consider donating ;)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f0e3c4fddb7d7e7539d72954252ae2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["mechabit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
