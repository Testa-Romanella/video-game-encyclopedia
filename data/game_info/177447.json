Try to hit each other while dodging at the same time in two available game modes: normal and sniper.</p>\n<p>Dodgeling is about:<br/>. Two players, one device.<br/>. Tap to dodge and shoot at the same time.<br/>. Battle anywhere, no internet needed.<br/>. Two game modes: Normal and Sniper.<br/>. Turnips!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n<p>I was stuck with this idea: playing together IS playing. I mean physically together -next to each other- sharing an intimate space. Or on the same device in this case. I pictured two friends in the tube, playing together, and meta-playing together. Playing, because playing by the rules: \"I shoot your turnip, you shoot mine\". Meta-playing, because bugging and poking each other to win. Quick, silly, and fun. Like all brief mindless things, it is always forgetable, yet still a close experience. Dodgelings will soon be published on Android and iOS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecb10f2dae4f0d0e2619a8a8910cf7ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["roccoS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
