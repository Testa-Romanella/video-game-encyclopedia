They were mere distorted expressions of the absolute spirit of games. This essence, neither absolute nor spiritual, transcends and immanently encompasses reality, which is itself but an illusion.</p>\n<p>LTLTL provides us with a means to establish a secure foundation for ethics (what ought to be done) and epistemology (what can be known) in ontology (what truly is). Thus, we can finally address the age-old inquiries:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Are games art (ontology)? <br/></p>\n<p>How do we know something is a game (epistemology)? <br/></p>\n<p>How do we recover ethics in game journalism (ethics)?</p>\n<p>With the discovery of\u00a0this material and spiritual foundation of ontological truth, LTLTL offers us a way to finally ground our knowledge and actions in Being itself.</p>\n<p>For all the most pressing questions of our time - the questions of all times, the question of Time itself -, LTLTL presents a response. An absolute and true answer, which, of course, means it can only be spoken not-whole. It is barely an answer at all, as it resolves nothing and opens us up to everything. An answer that can only be hinted at. It cannot be spoken - it can only be experienced.<br/></p>\n<p>Truth was forgotten by Thought; we can rediscover it through Play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T15:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa4f51c1503ad11f477ca5f6c6a719b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noah-art3mis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
