But don't stress, rather than fight back directly just break their oncoming arrows and keep on moving.</p><p><em>This game was made for the Mini\u00a0Jam 87:\u00a0Break. The limitation was: The player is a pacifist.</em><br/></p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Use your left mouse button to break the arrows that are falling down. You'll be able to prepare for where the arrows will come down from by looking at their position as they get fired off into the sky. The game will get harder in a few stages depending on your score.<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Game made by <strong>Luuk Noverraz</strong> using the Unity Engine.</p>\n<p>Background music made by <strong>RVKE</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other software used:<br/></p>\n<p>Affinity Designer</p>\n<p>Audacity</p>\r\nEXTRA\r\n<p>Try getting your score to 50 to see something neat... only for dedicated and patient gamers ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/104c4bc4af4713fb2caeb16b598110f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Luuk Noverraz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
