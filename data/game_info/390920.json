The light searches for some sort of solace in this world that seeks to destroy it, but finds nothing. This game was made over the course of 6 weeks for our Game Design &amp; Development II class.\u00a0 We tried to convey a sense of cosmic horror on the player. We tried to combine Horror and Bullet-hell, two very separate genres. It was a very fun experiment in genre combinations. We would like to do one or two more updates to the game, so please leave feedback! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>_______________________________________________________________<br/>CJ Axisa:...............................Project Lead, Programmer &amp; Designer<br/>John Shull:...........................Programmer &amp; Designer<br/>Alex Claypool:....................Designer &amp; Programmer<br/>Dillon Chan:........................Writer &amp; Programmer<br/>Sitong Chen:.......................Artist (Models, Textures &amp; \u00a0Animations)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f916b02a98d97270dd7bf20a872f179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CJ Axisa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
