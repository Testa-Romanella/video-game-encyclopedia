Your life is always draining away, and the collectables will give it back, but they don't last forever.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Luckily, you can respawn them by hitting the three rotating 'portals' on each level.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>The game lasts as long as you do. Go for the high score!</em></p>\n<p>XInput (Xbox controllers)\u00a0<strong>should</strong>\u00a0be supported, but please note, I test with a DualShock 4 and a program called DS4Windows to convert into Xinput mode, so this may be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>You can also only use the d-pad for movement (because analogue sticks shouldn't be used for 2D platformers, and\u00a0this is the hill I'll die on...).\u00a0</p>\n<p>No need to activate it, just start using your gamepad and it should just work. You can switch back to keyboard controls at any time by pressing 'Shift'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music graciously provided by my good friend chp.dmg who you should check out on Bandcamp for other awesome tracks. All other assets made by me.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8c4be8564be29174ff17de40d90a1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Let's Talk Game Design"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
