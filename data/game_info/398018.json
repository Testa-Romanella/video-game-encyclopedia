Run faster than your local partner, but not too fast or you'll trip! Each time you trip you'll take damage and run slower, giving you a permanent debuff for the stage. Trip 3 times or hit an obstacle and you'll break open! Don't worry though, stages are short so you'll quickly get back to playing this fun little game!<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd2055bdf876613488481c630563e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EggoGame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
