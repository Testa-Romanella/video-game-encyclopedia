{"id": 925681, "slug": "redwall-the-rpg-demo", "name": "Redwall: the RPG Demo", "name_original": "Redwall: the RPG Demo", "description": "<p>The beginning of the epic tale of Redwall, as written by Brian Jacques.</p>\n<p>Young Matthias starts his adventure at Redwall Abbey in times of peace, but matters quickly take a turn for the worst when Cluny the Scourge lays siege on the quiet abbey. Matthias rallies all vermin to defend the Abbey, find the sword of Martin the Warrior, and slay Cluny once and for all.</p>\n<p>I've started this project for the 2023 My\u00a0First Game Jam. I'm in school currently learning other methods of game development, but for this I chose to play around in RPG Maker MZ, a program I've been messing around with since I was little. I created all the sprites on my own and used assets from the Redwall Animated Series (I wanted to use the books, but I don't have them with me!). I have\u00a0<em>no</em> money because <strong>student</strong>, so I was unable to use any paid assets other than the Visustella plugins I had prior.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My focus as a game designer is on the narrative and concept development, which is part of why this demo is so short and only gets into the surface of the game. I was learning many of Visustella's plugins for the first time and also tried my hand at parallax mapping, with mixed results. However, the purpose was to conceptualize the game and port the Redwall animated series into a playable RPG. It still has a ways to go before I could even truly call it a demo, but it is a start.</p><p>I fell a bit short of what I wanted to accomplish due to some hardships earlier this week, and over a day went into developing characters, skills, weapons and armor that won't be seen yet. I also wanted to better the battle system, but I was only able to include a battle demo. I used Front View for battle for time constraints, as I already sprited out most of the playable characters and didn't want to add sideview sprites into the mix. I could do it in the future.</p>\n<p>If there is any interest in what I have so far, I'll continue to create and work on this title (<strong>if and when I find the time, because student)\u00a0</strong>and could eventually put out a Chapter One demo. If I completed it, I'd be aiming for about 8 chapters to emulate the TV series, though each chapter will be a little more packed than a 23-minute episode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anyone tries this out, thank you for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a5762c10887b3698979897013821f73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragontalen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
