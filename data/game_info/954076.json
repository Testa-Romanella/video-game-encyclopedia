Let's hope that meets the theme requirements.</em></p>\n<p>A political-thriller/pong game that I made for Trijam #214 over a development session that lasted a little under 3 hours. The music is original, the graphics are original, the story is original, and it's all grotesquely amoral, which I\u00a0suppose may seem the intended effect but in actuality is a result of poor planning.</p>\n<p>This is one in a series of works I am making that are intended as art-games used to prove that video games are incapable of being an art form. The game is a simple pong game with not a whole lot to it; it has an ending, and isn't really about the scores. As this was my first game made with the PICO-8 engine and as I only started using said engine approximately three days ago, the result is admittedly a little rough around the edges; nevertheless, I am still quite fond of the original score I\u00a0made for this, and request that thou playest this work long enough to be exposed to the complexities of the audio system.</p>\n<p>-S.
