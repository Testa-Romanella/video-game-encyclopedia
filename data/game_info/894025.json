As mentioned, you are an octopus, trying to defend the sea from nasty bounty hunters while getting rich collecting lots of valuable amber. A very simple plot, however there may be a few surprises. <br/></p>\n<p>Some inspiration was drawn from the first Legend of Zelda game, where you can move around the entire overworld freely without having to do everything in a particular order - however, some plot elements still remain completely linear. (as did they in The Legend of Zelda, for that matter.) Nonetheless, you have to figure out a lot of stuff for yourself in this game, and there is pretty much no hand-holding when it comes to just about anything. This is something that I think certain players are going to appreciate.\r\n</p>\n<p>I better mention the controls, as there is no in-game tutorial of any kind! (I am sure most players will be very grateful for this.)</p>\n<p>You have two sets of directional keys, WASD controls your movement as you would expect, but using the arrow keys, you can extend one of your arms in any of the four cardinal directions as well, which can be used for attacking and to pick up objects.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the F key is used to talk to NPC's, and the E and R keys are used to select between which item in your inventory you want to use. Said items are used just by extending one of your arms, and the item will be used in its direction.</p>\n<p>The controls can be changed in-game by the player to whatever they find more appropriate, however, only keyboard controls are supported, no mouse or gamepads.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/481ae3849b1a9c3847ba87137088a214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spring Spring"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
