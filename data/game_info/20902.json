While exploring a new planetoid, Flix takes an unfortunate nosedive into a chasm. It's your mission to guide Flix up and out of monster infested caves in the hopes of getting him back to his rocket-ship and the sanctuary of his cozy doggie home.<br/><br/>Highly inspired by the wonderful 8-bit classics, Flix The Flea returns to an almost forgotten sub-genre of cutesome high-jumping platform games. With a host of challenging environments and features, Flix creates just the right balance of fun and frustration for a very entertaining &amp; addictive gaming experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:47:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d986885eb0c07a84195c955211d2895.jpg", "website": "http://www.psychoticpsoftware.com/thegames_flixtheflea.html", "rating": 1.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 350, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Psychotic Psoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Psychotic Psoftware"], "esrb_rating": null}
