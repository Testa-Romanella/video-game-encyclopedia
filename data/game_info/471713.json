You've been hired as an entry level Gas Cap Laborer at the Fj\u00f6rd Automotive Company. Your one-and-only job is to fasten a gas cap to each car that comes down the conveyor belt. But there might just be some room for growth in the future if you work hard enough.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can left click on an empty slot to place a screw. Each screw needs 3 more clicks to fully secure them. All empty slots must have a fully secured screw before you can send the car down the line.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>At any time you are able to click on the employee handbook to pause the game, view controls, and access the main menu. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>There is a quota of cars to complete before your shift ends.
