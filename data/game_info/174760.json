It uses rigid body physics where each physics object models its own buoyancy. The ships start to sink if a good proportion of their volume is submerged. In contrast, the player controls a Kraken which is neutrally buoyant allowing it to travel through three dimensions.</p><p>It the game you attack ships from below using stealth. The ships will target your last sighted position with depth charges.</p><p>Unique features:</p><ul><li>Kraken is controlled by [world] yaw and [local] pitch. The roll axis self-rights for an improved experience</li><li>Buoyancy is really modelled: ships take on water when tipped and actually sink</li><li>Depth charges behave quite a lot like real ones \u2013 especially that moment where they enter the water and slow</li><li>This game was Not Made in Unity - source code is linked from the Ludum Dare page.</li></ul><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjQVWAS8A0k</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li>Arrow keys rotate view</li><li><strong>W</strong> swim forward</li><li><strong>S </strong>swim backward</li><li><strong>A/D </strong>swim (strafe) sideways</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum System Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Windows 7 with DirectX-End User Runtimes: (June 2010 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)</li><li>DirectX 11 compatible integrated graphics card with 1 GB Video RAM</li><li>Dual core CPU</li><li>2 GB Main Memory</li><li>Optional Leap Motion controller</li><li>Optional Oculus Rift VR</li></ul><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Windows 8 or Windows 10</li><li>DirectX 11 compatible discrete graphics card with 2 GB Video RAM</li><li>Intel i5 or better</li><li>4 GB Memory</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8f2aa1a8b0ea85b5118cbec7dacb1ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaaWolf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
