{"id": 933357, "slug": "scallion-rpg", "name": "Scallion RPG", "name_original": "Scallion RPG", "description": "<p><strong><em>=== ABOUT GAME ===</em></strong></p>\n<p>Scallion RPG is a Monster-Taming RPG where you adventure throughout the world discovering mysteries encountering unique Scallions and Battling with them in a turn based combat.</p>\n<p>For now the game has a basic Turn Based battle system where you choose move and it deals damage. The moves don't have any Typing only the Scallions have it and any move can be learned by any Scallion.</p>\n<p>To teach them new moves you have to find 'Move Card' which you can easily find when adventuring. All Scallions have 4 move from the start and you can change them anytime you want.</p>\n<p>In this game there is no 'Level System' so Scallions don't gain exp and they don't evolve they all have a basic set of Stats which can't be changed.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>=== FUTURE PLANS ===</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game currently has only two kinds of moves 'Physical' and 'Elemental' both are for damages. But my plane is to have four kinds of moves with 'Status' and 'Combo'. I have added them into the game but are really buggy so I decided to disable it for now.</p>\n<p>Status moves are effects that apply on Scallions, like Poison or Weakness.</p>\n<p>Combo moves are special there will be only 12 Combo move which you can find in the world by solving puzzles. Combo moves perform a special attack for example 'Half Life' which will make the opponent's health in half. This is still really early in development.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>=== IMPORTANT NOTE ===</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>This version of the game is a really really early in development and is meant to serve as a Prototype to mess around in. And so the game is not stable it may have game breaking bugs. That's why the game doesn't have a Save system yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>=== FOLLOW SOCIALS FOR UPDATES ===</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can follow my\u00a0Twitter and\u00a0YouTube to stay up-to-date on this project, and join my\u00a0Patreon to support this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T09:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/8983a57e84076a74027370b090b6aed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["FuminoStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
