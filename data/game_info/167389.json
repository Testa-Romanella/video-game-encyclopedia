It's a West meets East romantic comedy about some of the pitfalls of living in China and struggling to belong.\r\n\n<p><strong>The NAQ (Never Asked Questions) that nobody asked for.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>When did all this begin?</li></ul>\n<p>I got the concept while in China and had always tried to write the first chapter in novel form, but it never panned out. I couldn't decide between Wu and Gao as the main love interest, and so developed both of them. In June 2014 I contacted Anne with the concept and she took it on. It was a labor of love from that point on. Labor being the key word.</p>\n<ul><li>Why did you make this?</li></ul>\n<p>For a few key reasons.<br/>1. Apps for learning Chinese are often BORING and have no feel good romance to inspire you to language learning heights.<br/>2.The AMWF demographic is underrepresented in almost all forms of media. There are a lot of challenges in China for mixed-race couples and I wanted to shed some light on that.<br/>3. Otome visual novels tend to have shy girls as the lead instead of strong, independent girls who can get their own romance. I think bland lead characters don't deserve to have boys falling all over them for no reason whatsoever. It's unrealistic.</p>\n<ul><li>Is there a sequel planned?</li></ul>\n<p>Possibly, but we need all the inspiration we can get to do it. So don't hesitate to review, comment or send us an email. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0b/b0ba58a8489b04698b92af12c5c2bc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Godline"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
