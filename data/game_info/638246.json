It is very much like how fresh water and salty water in an ocean will form a clear border - and neither will blend with the other.\r\n<br/>There is a stark difference between the Sea of Stars and outside space, a difference that can only be felt by those who travel through it.</li><li><strong>The Standing City</strong> -\u00a0The greatest form of human settlement left on the Earth. It is known for its great merchanting masses, where salvages from the Sea of Stars fetch a great variety of prices.</li><li><strong>The Two Tribes</strong> -\u00a0The two tribes, according to religious texts, were once two very savage and evil tribes of humans. They destroyed anything they came across and brought despair to humans like nothing else before.<br/>\r\nHearing of their deeds, a very powerful king set out one day to enclose them within a valley between two mountains. <br/>Which two specifically, were lost to the turnings of time.\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is said however, that their return will be a great sign of the ending of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Intra elfen spece</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/57901f9f755ee484261a0ebc5c14ee75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PneumaVoid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
