But it can always be tuned to lower end hardware in the settings menu.)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has tree game modes you can play with your friends<br/>\r\n  -  Conquest, Dominate the capture points and kill the enemy in order to win with your team<br/>\r\n  -  Rush, Try to detonate a series of bombs, or try to defend them.<br/>\r\n  -  Free for All, just want to aimlessly shoot everything that moves? we got you covered!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery game mode has it's own unique map that is designed with care and passion. <br/>\r\nI'm planning to add more maps and game modes during the further development of this game.<br/>\r\nThe best part: you can be part of it. Because I'm always open to suggestions via the FleurBird YouTube channel's comment section.<br/>\r\nmost parts of the development will also be documented and can be found at the same channel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCome and see for yourself!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb5ab6b0e136f274d6d394c566502468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FleurBird"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["FleurBird"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
