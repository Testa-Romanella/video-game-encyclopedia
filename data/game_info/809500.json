The game was originally going to be that snippy (the player) would go around the document \"fixing\" words and sentences and the cursor would chase snippy, if touched by the cursor you lose a life, more \"fixed\" things in the document the better. There was also going to potentially be a second, flaming red cursor that would be faster and probably would be an insta-kill. Not many more things were planned for it because after all the ideas mentioned being removed it was simplified.\u00a0 (There was also an idea to turn this into a horror game about snippy being possessed by the soul of a dead person and him wanting to be freed.)</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening to my dumb rant about my clippy inspired character.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T09:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef3906eaf3af7f30585b16f356ead5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CatLovesSoup"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
