Casual exploration with a skill-rewarding, easy to learn combat system make up the core of gameplay.Combat<br />\nIn combat, landing your strike cancels your attack animation, allowing you to attack again, immediately. Various degrees of knockback ensure that continuously landing hits will require constant re-positioning. You can equip two weapons balanced around these factors at a time, offering a wide range of builds with diverse movesets. You&#39;ll need to find weapons that combo well together, and can adapt to any situation.<br />\nVariety in combat styles is also encouraged by collecting temporary weapons and perks. You&#39;ll always have your basic equipment, of course, which can be swapped out if you find something you like better.Exploration<br />\nEvents, both random and based on the real time clock, ensure that you&#39;ll always see something different each play session, from different creatures emerging at certain hours, to daily bosses.<br />\nLore and writing fleshes out a fairy tale-esque world, telling you fantastical stories about its unusual inhabitants through various sources, including an in-depth NPC dialogue system.<br />\nAnd perhaps, if you are determined, you might just find the Blessed Surface...FeaturesA seamless open world<br />\nLarge population of unique enemies and bosses<br />\nSkill-based combat system, with different weapons, armor, and perks for variety<br />\nFunctioning ecosystem allowing for creature population control, invasive species, and other innovative mechanics<br />\nRandom and timed events<br />\nKeyword-based dialogue system, hiding many secrets if you know what to ask, allowing players to take conversation at their own pace<br />\nDeep lore and stories to discover<br />\nBasic two-player online multiplayer; players are synchronized, enemies from another player&#39;s world are not (easily join via Steam, no port forwarding or setup required)Why open-world, rather than a Metroidvania?There are a few subtle differences, in both level design, and the way content is structured. Metroidvania level design is generally a series of interconnected paths, whereas you can think of open world as a perfectly connected grid. Metroidvanias are based on going from place to place to find new things, whereas an open world contains a lot more dynamic systems, to give you a unique experience no matter where in the map you are!<br />\nFor making it to the end, you have been blessed by the Biter of good fortune.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T21:33:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6da1eafb7eb59a779d8fb69356641cff.jpg", "website": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bsurf/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corpse King Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Corpse King Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
