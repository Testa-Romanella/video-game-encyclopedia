Theme is 'My weakness is also my strength'\r\n</p>\n<p>I took a players health is there weakness. So if you press space bar it costs you health but creates 2 shadow warriors to battle with. The shadow warriors can shoot and take no damage. Game gets faster every 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>'WASD\" to move and mouse to aim and shoot.\r\n</p>\n<p>'Space' to create shadow warriors. 'Space' removes the warriors but no need to do that in this early release.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ran out of time so just a high score game. Lots of potential for further development be interested to hear what people think of concept. Thanks.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T11:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d17d8354c4a4ed0ee3e11dac2a10b42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jam_mack46"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
