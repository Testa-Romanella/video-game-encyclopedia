They asked for a simple game in PPT, I decided to make this.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should play this on PowerPoint, I can't guarantee it'll work right with other PPTX players.</p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>\n<p><em>A short story about a witch on the run and the kind human that helps her. This game introduces the characters of the story (whether or not I continue this on Ren'py is still undecided).</em></p>\n<p><em>Morgan: A young but powerful\u00a0witch. Not much is know about her or her past other than she is a kind girl with family who also seem to be witches.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ben: An average guy who lives alone. His parents work abroad, his aunt coming by every now and then to check up on him and help around the house. He studies art.</em></p>\n<p><em>Silverblades: An organization of monster hunters. They hunt vampires, werewolves, witches, etc. Anything that is out of the ordinary is fair game to them.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>[Character art]</p>\n<p>Splash Screen:\u00a0https://picrew.me/image_maker/4395</p>\n<p>Morgan:\u00a0https://picrew.me/image_maker/42963</p>\n<p>Deneb:\u00a0https://picrew.me/image_maker/437426</p>\n<p>[Music]</p>\n<p>Free Creative Commons BGM collection by LunaLucid\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>[Backgrounds]</p>\n<p>Noraneko Background Pack by Noraneko</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b4306ee64248561da4c09c604caeaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quacksont"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
