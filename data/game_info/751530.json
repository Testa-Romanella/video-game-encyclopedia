Can you manage the administrative hell that is this company, and balance the books and your sanity? Or will you forever be remembered amongst the lost souls crying behind their desks?</p>\n<p>And hey, if it's too much, you can always just doodle on your desk instead.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n<p>The controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Left click the stamp / pen to pick it up</li><li>Left click whilst holding something to draw with it</li><li>Right click to drop something</li><li>Left click and drag to move the papers around</li><li>Move the papers into the outbox to send them off</li></ul>\n\n<strong>MY THOUGHTS</strong>\n<p>I kind of like how this game turned out; it's a pretty interesting concept and it looks and feels alright to use, generally. Despite that, I would've liked to give it more story, more characters, more flavour and feeling in general, since right now it's a bit empty and there's not much reason to continue on playing after a few minutes. I suppose since it's a jam game that's expected, but it would've been pretty easy to just add some characters or something. It'd make the game more personal. I do, however, like how the game controls and feels to play, since I wasn't sure how managing papers and stamping things would turn out at the beginning of development - I did waste a lot of testing time by doodling things on the table! Overall, I'd say I had fun making this - and I hope you have fun playing it too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa0826bb372415fd7f4407a23f1b57a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
