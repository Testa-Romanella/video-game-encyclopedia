Me neither!</p>\n<p>This game is a throwback to dreaming and not having your cake, don't remember anything? No worries, you'll forget everything after today too!</p>\n<p>This game is basically a simulation on what a dream could hypothetically be. What is a dream? What is a nightmare? What is your mind that causes you to have a weird dream that doesn't make sense? Are we guilty? Are we innocent?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thinking can be weird, and even when we don't think dreams can be what our subconscious thinks. I might be wrong, I'm not an expert, I'm just a dude who made a game.</p>\n<p>This game is also a throwback to pixel shaded games that were released on the original Playstation such as Ridge Racer or Doom for the Playstation (albeit different genres). I also mainly got inspiration from Osamu Sato and LSD Dream Emulator, thank you.</p>\n<p>Made for Halloween 2020.</p>\n<p>Adil S - Director, Creative Director, Game Design, 3D\u00a0Art, Level Design, Tech Art</p>\n<p>Austin Lothman - 3D\u00a0Artist (keys)</p>\n<p>Game audio from;</p>\n<p>Mixkit<br/></p>\n<p>Dl\u00a0Sound</p>\n<p>Zapslat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T07:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba2ec8eef9f8dc89ec5429cce5c3091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adil S"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
