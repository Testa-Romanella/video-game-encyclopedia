All the comments and feedback left on the jam version helped me a lot in completing this game. I really hope you like this final version.</p>\n<p>You can also play and download Clicker Royale on my personal website:\u00a0https://www.maxence-jacquot.com/clicker-royale</p>\r\n\r\nWhat is Clicker Royale ?\r\n<p>For all of you that are new to this game, welcome.</p>\n<p>Clicker Royale is a game I originally made for the Juice Jam back in January 2022. I received very good feedback and comments and it motivated me to work on a more polished version.<br/>What I ended up doing is a complete overhaul with a better system, cosmetics and better animations.</p>\n\r\nHow To Play ?\r\n<p>Clicker royale is a kind of dungeon crawler with clicker mechanics.</p>\n<p>The objective is to overcome 7 of your opponents with increasing difficulty.</p>\n<p>To do that you have two phases. A looting phase and a fight phase.</p>\n<p>In the looting phase, you have to click the loot button.</p>\n\n<p>This will give you coin that you can spend in the shop for upgrades.</p>\n<p>In the shop, you have a random set of 3 upgrades that you can reroll. The more you buy upgrades the more expensive it gets.</p>\n\n<p>Wen the looting phase is over you go to the fight phase.</p>\n<p>In the fight phase, you have to click the fight button. That will make you attack the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>When the enemy attacks you, you have the opportunity to dodge when you see this prompt.</p>\n\n<p>To dodge you have to press the arrow on the right or left of the fight button.</p>\n\r\nDownloads\r\n<p>You can download Clicker Royale just below it is completely free with no in-app transaction or adds.</p>\n<p>Clicker Royale is made to be a mobile game and you can find an APK below to install on your Android Phone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T10:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/322dfcae750a62b3272ede54eddd260e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Maxence Jacquot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
