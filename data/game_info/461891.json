The theme was Profit and Corporations, so I decided to do somethin over the suicides of salariman, wiith a touch from the Tabletop RPG Kult:Divinity Lost. I tried to create some sort of lovecraftian vibe for it, so do not expect jumpscares. Also, it has two small puzzles.</p>\n<p>Is it ready? Far from it. It's playable, but I didn't have the time to finish musics and other feel good stuff.</p>\n<p>Is it good? Maybe. You tell me. I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13c8f5fb6f126fca65b5eb4905d0d07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GKorn"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
