I did those BASIC programs in the user's manual and were happy about that now famous\u00a0\u00a0Commodore balloon. But\u00a0I read in the magazines that the C64 BASIC was crappy and not suitable for games and that the good games are done in assembly.<br/></p>\n<p>But as a young non-english speaker and without the internet I didn't find the right resources to teach myself assembly language.</p>\n<p>Later I lost my interest in the C64 (and even my Amiga...), had a job and had to do other stuff.</p>\n<p>Some time ago the retro wave caught me, like so many others and with the internet I found many good resources to start programming in assembly again.</p>\n<p>This game is based on a tutorial (see ingame credits page) and my interest in hearing podcasts. It's a thank you to all small podcasters out there who do it for fun, not for money.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:34:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d4a741facdd8e70d0ac5e9c581edcbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CptSparky360"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
