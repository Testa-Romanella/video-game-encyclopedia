It will be a torture for your mind to complete all levels.\r\n\r\nIn short, the apparent simplicity of Cubot is in contradiction with the complexity of the level-design.\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>Easy gameplay, one finger is enough to move the cube where you want...that's it!</li>\n<li>Simplistic but not repetitive, several concepts are used to diversify puzzles but also to  make them more complex. Like color cubes with different capacities or elements (buttons, elevators, color swappers, teleporters\u2026).</li>\n<li>The game and menus have a clean look to not disturb your concentration. In the same vein, the music is very soothing.</li>\n<li>There are 80 levels in the game for several hours of playtime to keep you challenged.</li>\n<li>The challenge increases level by level. but if you are stumped, help is available!</li>\n</ul>\r\nContact\r\n<ul>\n<li>Web Site: http://games.nicoplv.com/cubot</li>\n<li>Twitter:\u00a0@NicoplvGames</li>\n<li>Facebook:\u00a0NicoplvGames</li>\n<li>Email:\u00a0games@nicoplv.com</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa4ea6cac101aad05ec4db4bc0ffeab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NicoplvGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
