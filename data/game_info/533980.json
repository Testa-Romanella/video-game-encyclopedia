Minimalist composers often use repetitive rhythms and melodies that overlap and phase with each other, sometimes very structured and sometimes up to the players discretion.</p>\n<p>Terry Reily's In C on youtube<br/></p>\n<p>In this game each element of the level is assigned a sound and will activate based on\u00a0 a variety of rhythms it will cycle through. Each level will be different on each playthrough and may range from chaotic to not overwhelmingly chaotic. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The players goal is to stay on top of the large moving platform; not being on the platform will lower your score, as will being hit by red level elements. Collect golden 8th notes to increase your score multiplier, which will have a large impact on your final score. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Sound is very important for this game so be sure to plug in headphones and adjust the volume accordingly, or for the daring plug in a speaker and treat everyone around to a recital of minimalism inC++.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use A/D to move left/right and space to jump. Holding shift will give you access to a stronger jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c4a9ed74ef0859f9ae54d925fd3ebae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DragonHawkGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
