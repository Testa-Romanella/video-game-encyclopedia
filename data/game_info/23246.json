While sleepless warriors roam the halls with their minds eroded by eternity, a lone Awakewalker emerges from cryosleep. With no memory of their past, it\u2019s up to them to forge their future, discover the planet\u2019s mysteries, and find a way out of this icy hell.<br/><br/>Fight against challenging enemies with complex behaviours while exploring levels built around single checkpoints.

Levels feature many unlockable shortcuts so you are always progressing no matter what.<br/><br/><strong>Intense Bossfights:</strong> Every level features a powerful boss enemy.
