The enemies slowly get faster as well (displayed on an Amazon Kindle you can climb), but you can remedy this by occasionally reminiscing in my older times when I used a Raspberry Pi 3b positioned at the right side higher layer of my desk. No win condition, just try and get a high score!</p>\n<p>Move with WASD, Jump/Climb with space (longer hold equals higher jump), left click to swipe attack</p>\n\n<p>Slider on right side of title screen is mouse sensitivity adjustment</p>\n<p>WebGL or the play button at the top is most recommended as it's convenient and I got it working fine other than not being able to go into fullscreen mode, but a Windows and untested Mac build is available for download as well</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a2936515233f7741b2d83d10caf81c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CreeperCrafter979"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
