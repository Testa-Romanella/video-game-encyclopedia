I decided that battle royale is a game-mode, right? Not a game type...</p>\n<p>So i present a battle-royale inspired racing game. The aim is to be the last player in the race! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you're in last place, you have 5 seconds to get out of last place or else you explode! Also, if you get lapped by the player in first, you explode! Don't worry though, as players who explode may still drive around the course as <em>ghost cars</em> no longer participating in the race, but still able to practice and explore the course freely.</p>\n<p>Once the race is over, use the menu to start another one!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer with Bots!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It is multiplayer via direct IPv4 connection, and supports AI cars also. It is best played over LAN. Players who join will automatically assume control of an AI car.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Rounds can be restarted via the menu, as well as the button in the top right corner\u00a0to being a full race.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\"wasd\" : Drive</li><li>\"r\" : Flip Car</li><li>\"esc\" : Menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd823fc38c98f2b033198d4b34ca146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Adey"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
