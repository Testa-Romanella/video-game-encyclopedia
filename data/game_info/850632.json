I'm going to gauge how people figure the game out and use that data to maybe do some simple tutorials etc. Depends on a lot on the feedback, so please feel free to comment any gripes and suggestions!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T12:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c2219824fa09679ccbd695938886f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
