{"id": 923774, "slug": "minesweeper-benlev", "name": "MineSweeper (BenLev)", "name_original": "MineSweeper (BenLev)", "description": "<p>Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the objective is to uncover all the squares on a grid while avoiding the mines. The game takes place on a rectangular grid with some squares marked as mines, and the rest of the squares left blank. The player clicks on squares to reveal what's hidden underneath, and the number on a revealed square indicates how many mines are adjacent to it. The player must use logic to deduce the location of mines and mark them using flags, trying not to trigger any of them in the process. The game ends when the player either uncovers all the squares without hitting a mine or triggers a mine, causing the game to end in failure. Minesweeper provides an engaging and challenging experience for players of all ages</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T09:59:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/109/109055807fc315ea809515b14e52ff04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenLev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
