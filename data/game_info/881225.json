And have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.\" )</strong><br/><br/><h3>Portal + Minecraft + ...Getting Over it?</h3>Rubble is set in a silly dystopian future game show (think MXC / Takeshi's Castle, etc.) where contestants are pitted against dangerous obstacle courses in a simulated physics environment. To survive, they must use the power of friendship (or respawning) and this gun they found. With each spectacular death, the announcer will read a one-line intro for the next expendable contestant to give it a try!<h3>Speedrun / Replayability Encouraged!</h3>Every level tracks your time (but NEVER compared it on a leaderboard, you can post it on Reddit if you're into that)! The main menu keeps a tally of ALL your best times for every level! If you make a mistake, use the quick restart hotkeys and be back in in seconds!<h3>Player-determined Difficulty with Assist Mode and Level Skipping</h3>Frustration sucks, so Rubble offers the ability to tweak the gravity, speed, air control, and number of air-jumps you get to make things more approachable (or skip a section entirely!) And if you really get stuck, after a short time you can skip any level and move on to the next (you can come back later in the level select if you want!)<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> 50 levels with new mechanics every few levels!<br/></li><li> Did you know dogs only have 1/6th as many taste buds as humans?<br/></li><li> Assist mode settings like slowing time, lowering gravity, and adding additional jumps!<br/></li><li> Cool animal facts on the loading screens!<br/></li><li> Speedrun Friendly and replayable with best times saved in the menus!<br/></li><li> ...Destructible environments!<br/></li><li> Narwhal Horns are essentially, inside-out teeth (soft and sensitive on the outside, hard on the inside), with over 10 million nerve endings!<br/></li><li> ...And much more!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T05:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/5411d2de76ae30b7f5a928af1825daa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grant Tabler"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Grant Tabler"], "esrb_rating": null}
