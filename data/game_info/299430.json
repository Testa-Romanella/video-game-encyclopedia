While watering the flowers, you hear a noise from below.\u00a0 Peering over the edge, reveals that a rival Ninja clan are breaking into the compound and staging an attack! <br/></p>\n<p>Sadly, although you locked the doors, the windows are all open (it's a hot day!) Armed only with a huge supply of potted flowers, your new missions is to  stop them getting in for as long as possible. <br/></p>\n<p>The rival ninjas attack in groups of 12.\u00a0 The longer you can hold them off for, the faster they'll get and the more points you can earn. If 6\u00a0 manage to enter the Dojo, they'll destroy part of the building and you'll take on that wave again but a slower speed.<br/></p>\n<p>The game ends when the rivals have gotten in six times.
