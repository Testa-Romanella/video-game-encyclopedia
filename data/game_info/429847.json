She always tries to see the good in the people around her, choosing to inspire and motivate the others around her with her upbeat energy and optimism. Despite her kindness to others, however, she refuses to let people walk all over her, become rather headstrong and pig-headed when people try to tell her to do something different than what she wants to do. But nevertheless, she's a leader to the fullest capacity. She also likes to train and fight alot, so it's not usual for her to brag about her win-streak against the other guardsmen.</p>\n\n<p>SER ROWEN MARGRAVE --\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of King Valeron's most trusted agents who often handles the dirty work of the kingdom. Quiet and stoic, it's often hard to tell what's going on in Rowen's mind as they go about their daily tasks. That is, if you can find them about the castle. They're rather elusive. Rowen tends not to speak to many people, but perhaps it's better for them that way -- as they view themselves more as an expendable asset for Valeron to use. A bit on the angsty side, Rowen still showcases a passion and loyalty that burns brighter than anyone else, and will fight until their last breath to protect what is most valuable to them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>LIEUTENANT HARLAND CARVER --</p>\n<p>The most disciplined of all of the knights at the Glades, Harland was once a man with an adventurous past. A fighter by nature, he used to get into all sorts of trouble. However, after being betrayed by a companion of his, left injured and to take a blame for a crime the didn't commit, he was given the choice: reform or repent in solitude. Thus, he joined the guards, becoming Adaline's second in command and the strict and brutal side to Adaline's energetic and carefree atmosphere. He take his work very seriously, refusing to do much of small talk unless it's something to do with his duty to the guards. He also has a very bad anger issue and fails sometimes to hold his tongue.</p>\n\n<p>ISIDORE IVALICE --</p>\n<p>A scholar recruited by the royal guard to offer his insight and knowledge to the knights. With information on all sorts of things, from maps of various lands to customs and traditions, Isidore is the man to go to for anything. A bit eccentric and flirtatious with everyone who comes his way, he's a bit of a handful to deal with. But if you manage to befriend him and give him all sorts of tea (gossip and actual tea), he's more than happy to assist you. If not, then you best pay up in other various ways. He's a very majestic individual, despite his dramatic personality, but he proves to be a valuable ally to you -- especially when there's something rather 'magical' about him as well.<br/></p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>CAST AND CREW --</p>\n<p>Sprite Artist and Coder:<br/>Steph Nguyen</p>\n<p>Writers:<br/>Steph Nguyen<br/>Jordan Bonn<br/>Shakyra Dunn</p>\n<p>Voice Cast:<br/></p>\n<p>Magic Kaito as ADALINE WENDELL<br/>King Kodiak as HARLAND CARVER<br/>Ryan Hoyle as ISIDORE IVALICE<br/>LeeLoo_VA as ROWEN MARGRAVE<br/>VynVoxVA as SANCTUS/THEODOSIA SIDONIA<br/>JayOrtizVA as LYSANDER<br/>Bpjenkins123088 as KING VALERON<br/>Lucaricross as ASTERIUS MARQUIS<br/>JessiCartoons as SERENITY BARNHARDT<br/>John Klaus as JEREMIAH EMBERLY</p>\n<p>Backgrounds Courtesy by Rachel Chen<br/>https://itch.io/profile/rachelchen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c8bcde9bbdad22f0a3d96f50196dd2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephicness"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
