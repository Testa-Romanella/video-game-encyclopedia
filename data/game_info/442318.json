In Hardly Hungry Harry you play as a watermelon sandwich trying to fling itself into Harry\u2019s mouth to progress to the next level. Be careful though as you don't wan't to drink milk and turn into a disgusting meat sandwich! Just a note, if you are playing on a device with a 16x9 aspect ratio, hit the blue full screen button. If you are on a device without a 16x9 aspect ratio, like most MacBooks, hit the transparent gray full screen button. Playing in some sort of fullscreen is highly reccomended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4ba20ed9910e01fdaa289667a2bb339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenBonk"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
