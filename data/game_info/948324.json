Turn dead soil into fertile grassland, clean polluted oceans, plant sprawling forests, and create the ideal habitat for animals to call home. Then recycle your buildings and leave no trace that you were there. Reclaim the wasteland.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A reverse city builder</strong></p>\n<p>Use advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more\u2014then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants.</p>\n<p><strong>Different maps every time</strong></p>\n<p>Procedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same. Plan your build around randomized, challenging, and unpredictable terrain, including snaking rivers, mountains, lowlands, and oceans.</p>\n<p><strong>A natural ebb and flow</strong></p>\n<p>Each region of Terra Nil progresses through phases, with the ultimate goal being leaving pristine wilderness behind. Levels are not about infinite growth, but rather balancing and nurturing the environment before leaving it in peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience tranquility</strong></p>\n<p>Lush hand-painted environments, relaxing music, and an atmospheric ambient soundscape make Terra Nil a peaceful, meditative experience. When you're done, use Appreciate mode to bask in the natural beauty of the ecosystem you have restored.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T08:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/473e438fc51a521598f9564bcfe78143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Free Lives"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
