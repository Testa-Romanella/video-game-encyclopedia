That game became Dormination. After completing GGJ 2019 and deciding that Dormination deserved more TLC than was possible over a single weekend, we decided to polish it up for a full fledged release.</p>\n<p><strong>Early Access Notice</strong> - We are releasing Dormination currently as an early access title. It is not feature complete, things are liable to change. At present time the game\u00a0<em>requires 4 players</em><em> in local multiplayer</em>.\u00a0 We have plans to enable 2-4 player multiplayer, both local and online, but for now you'll just have to talk your friends into joining you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/176a30da1604559d69c940aacedf14a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["straitjacketsoftware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
