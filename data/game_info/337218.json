Most people are gone. </p>\n<p>And the ones still around apparently decided that the best thing to do - is to ride. Ride their silly cars like there\u2019s no tomorrow (because there probably isn\u2019t). </p>\n<p>Carbage is a cute and easy-going, no-threshold, bumper car party for everyone. It\u2019s perfectly simple for children or inexperienced players, and offers some ridiculous stunts to master among mature gamers. Play in your couch, with your friends and family.

No big budget estimates. You just wanna get in there and get dirty with the gameplay, code and graphics. </p>\n<p>At Hello There Games, we are constantly at work with several bigger productions. We love them, and they take up most of our time. But every now and then there\u2019s an hour there, half a day here. That\u2019s where this game got done.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not pixel-perfect-polished. It\u2019s not the deepest experience out there. It\u2019s not the biggest title we\u2019ve shipped. It\u2019s not the smallest either. </p>\n<p>But it is something that we really had fun developing, and really really really wanted to share with you before the summer vacation.</p>\n<p>We sincerely hope that you will have fun with it.</p>\n<p>With love,</p>\n<p>Hello There Games</p>\n<p>To get in contact with us use our Discord Server</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb6efd0d79ba0f281db3d9a79c0d646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HelloThereGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
