Every 10 seconds, the Cubes become faster, involving you to strategically out-maneuver them. </p><p>Snatch Mode is also 2D, and this time you must Snatch the Gold Ball. When you snatch it, it disappears to a new place. Just as in Original Mode, the Cubes become faster every 10 seconds, once again involving great strategics to beat your High Score. </p><p>Downhill Mode is, unlike its fellow game modes, 3D, and involves you going down a closed in hill, where multiple cubes are blocking the pathway. Can you get past them and claim victory?</p><p> Download Dodgecube to get 3 fun and entertaining game modes, each of which have 3 different difficulties, Easy, Medium and Hard.
