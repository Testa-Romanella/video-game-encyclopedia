This pit has been explored by many due to its abundant treasures and legendary mysteries.</p>\n<p>Tragically, the landscape of the town changed when General Taylor Artois and his team of scouts, who had spent many years exploring the pit, descended but never returned. This would be one of the first teams to be swallowed by the pit, but not the last.</p>\n<p>As the months passed, with several missing teams and no trace of them whatsoever, the guild of explorers closed the entrance to the pit due to the high risks, which generated a crisis in the town. As time moved on, the town was able to find other ways to remain almost financially stable, but it never recovered its former glory, and more importantly, no one ever solved the mystery of the disappearance of the explorers and one of the most important figures of the town.</p>\n<p>Our protagonist, Jack Daniels, will form a secret team with Stella Artois, sister of Taylor Artois, and Smirnoff J\u00e4eger, a guard of the entrance to take their hero back from the depths. They will face any adversity in search of\u00a0 answers and treasures that lie at the bottom, which no one has reached or returned from.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Use your team of three to tackle the different situations you will be thrown in during your journey through the depths of the pit, quickly switching from character to character to do different skill combos and take your enemies in different, creative ways. Shoot them while carefully placing mines with\u00a0Stella Artois, dash through them and hit them quickly using Jack Daniels,, or tank their damage while hitting hard with Smirnoff J\u00e4eger.</p>\n<p><strong>MINIMUM REQUIRMENTS</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>WINDOWS</em>:\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit\r\n</li></ul><ul><li>Proessor: Quad-core Intel o AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster</li></ul><ul><li>RAM: 8 GB RAM\r\n</li></ul><ul><li>Graphic card: compatible with DirectX 11 o DirectX 12</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to give us some feedback:\u00a0https://forms.gle/LWV4ZcRqJuiS5uLK9<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:34:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79dcf26671b15f223468662c1b954381.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revelion-santi", "hairybald", "Bicharrajo", "Jades98", "Swallowtail"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
