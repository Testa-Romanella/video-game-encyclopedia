The game is played with black and white stones on a 15x15 board.\u00a0But we played it most often\u00a0with a pen on a paper tablecloth during lunchtime.</p>\n<p>The rules are simple: be the first to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically or diagonally. First player (black) must avoid forbidden moves, while the other player (white) can corner him into making one.</p>\n<p>Here, we're playing the gentleman's way: all dangerous moves will blink as a warning, and forbidden moves are simply prevented. The game philosophy is to avoid low blows and to politely announce what's going on.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Life is short, but there is always time enough for courtesy.</em>\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>\n\r\n\u26ab Features\r\n<ul><li>Rules from The Renju International Federation</li><li>24 opening patterns</li><li>Forbidden moves for the black player</li><li>Play against a friend or against the computer</li><li>Simple, yet beautiful black and white vector graphics</li></ul>\n\r\n\u26ab Compatibility\r\n<p>You can install this game on your Android phone, Android TV or on the good old OUYA!
