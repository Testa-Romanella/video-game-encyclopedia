The world is split up in black and white. Only the black girl can move through the white world, while the white girl can only stroll through the black world.</p>\n<p>Both girls can turn themselves into a 'block' which creates a hole in the world, allowing the other girl to pass through parts of the other world. (see screenshots for how this works, it's difficult to explain in words).</p>\n<p>Your goal is to <strong>keep</strong> yourselves <strong>alive</strong> by collecting pieces of food scattered throughout the levels. After all food is collected, lead each lady to the exit to finish the level.</p>\n<p>This game is made for Ludum Dare 46.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/848586896aa3a225cb93d13d82ab64f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Phoenix Fireflower"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
