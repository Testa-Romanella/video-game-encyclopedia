They pulled you out of it and into their \u201creal world,\u201d which shoved you into the tiny body of a \u201cdog.\u201d<br/><br/> You can travel back to your world, but you\u2019re still tethered to the real world. To get free, you need to escape their lab. <br/><br/> Switch into your true form in the dark world to get around guards and gain enhanced mobility, but remember that there are creatures in the darkness that will eat even you. Switch to the real world to make use of your smaller stature and to turn on lights to banish the darkness. Use all the tools at your disposal to get free so you can live your life in peace.</p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0 Dylan Briggs, Jackson Nelson-Gal, Devin Ohlson, Zach Perlo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8d3c0f2c40de6dc38edb9185dfd850d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Case Western Reserve Univ.
