But note that each robot can only execute one command.</p>\n<p>The robots in this game are as simple as they can be, but combine the robots and commands smartly and you create a great machine, that can complete the task set.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is not a complete game, but only a prototype to explore the core game mechanic. Unfortunately, I only got in two days before the end of the jam and didn't have enough time for a full game. But wanted to present the basic idea, so the game is lacking polish and more levels.
