We were tasked with making anything so long as it had 4 game-feel elements that could be toggled on and off. This game definitely fulfills those requirements as it has\u00a0Motion Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, Vignette, Camera Shake, Animations, SFX, Particle FX, and some Music. The idea of this game is a twist on platforming as most platformers require jumping but this game restricts your jumping ability, and you have to move using your gun.\u00a0 Just this one concept alone makes platforming more interesting, but we combined it with obstacles and enemies to make a good but difficult 1-Level demo for this prototype.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game!</p>\r\nLore\r\n<p>Some mad scientist strapped a gun onto a sentient wheel... why? why would you do that?</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music</p>\n<p>SFX\u00a0(Some from that website and some created by us)</p>\n<p><strong>All art is done by us</strong></p>\r\nPresentation Link", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T10:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a5e5a17af0a7efce3b0287e6f6ac122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sigh_nou", "Taneim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
