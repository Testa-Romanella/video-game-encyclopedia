The theme was \"<em>Progress is Failure</em>\".</p>\n<p><strong>My original plan</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You spawn as a new sperm cell every time you die. Throughout your life\u2014on your way to the ovum (egg cell)\u2014you would collect energy to break down the outer egg cell wall. This would take a few lives and the corpses of your old lives would still be stuck to the ovum walls. You would either hope to not end up like them, or you'd thank them for helping you break down the barrier... or both!\u00a0 Each <em>failed </em>sperm cell\u00a0<em>progresses </em>you towards fertilization.</p><p><strong>Reality</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I didn't budget my time very well on this guy, and I\u00a0barely have a prototype at 2 hours before the deadline. I only got around to implementing very basic mechanics that doesn't really have anything to do with the theme. But I had fun making the art and playing around with different ideas in Unity that I had for the game.<br/></p>\n<p>I haven't  slept in 48 hours. Chalking this one up to a: failure to deliver on the goal, but still somewhat satisfied with the outcome. It's kinda pretty to look at and fun to do little dashes swimming around as a sperm cell.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:38:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d965996b8b86c313fba54b0bc99336f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Levi Murray"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
