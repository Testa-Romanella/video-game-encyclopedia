The color palette is the original palette of the Commodore 64, which is very limited, but this was a lot of fun to work with.</p>\n<p>The game was created using Unity 2017 and Paint.net. Programming, design and graphics were done by me except for the C64-screen of course. The music pieces in the title and ending screens were composed and written by skrjablin and are public domain. They were downloaded from opengameart.org.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is not very complicated. Avoid close contact, stay alive, stay sane and wait. You can go shopping, take a walk in the park, visit your girlfriend or go to a bar (not possible in 2020). Just like in real life, the most frustrating part is that you cannot do much except wait for the infection rate to go down. Well, you can read a lot or play a lot of games, but you should not forget that you also must eat and sleep.<br/></p>\n<p>Stay safe, stay healthy!</p>\n<p>Oh, and don't support firing any government pandemic response teams. You never know when you might need them.\u00a0 :-) <br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T10:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb545d5facae4807aa49aa226f94689a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
