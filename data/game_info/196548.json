I showed it to some of my co-workers at UC Berkeley, and I flippantly declared that the game was probably made in a weekend.  When Friday rolled around, I decided to test that idea and build a Flappy Bird clone in 48 hours.  At the same time, some of my office mates and I were joking around about the Miley Cyrus song \"Wrecking Ball.\"  When I sat down to build the game, I figured that a mash-up of the two was in order.  So, I made the game over the weekend, showed up to work on Monday, and spent about a week playing it with my co-workers. It's mostly a throw-away programming exercise, but I still had fun building it.  End of story.  2 weeks later someone else had the same idea, launched a Miley/Flappy mash-up in the app store, and made a bunch of dough.  Oops.  Guess it pays to monetize.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51ebd3a8853d6a6c181a6ce5945e272d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRealMattKain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
