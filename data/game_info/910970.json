Developed by an indie game developer with intermediate programming experience and beginner art skills, this game serves as a learning experience and a way to experiment with different game development tasks.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game features simple movement controls, obstacles, and a scoring system based on time taken to complete the level. The player character is a simple cube, while the level is constructed out of tiled cubes. Spikes are placed in the level and cause the player to reset to the last checkpoint on the current level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please note that the game is a prototype and some features such as Power-ups, Animations, Sound effects, and music have not been included in this prototype.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing our first game and we would appreciate any feedback you may have.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T14:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b0c447e0208eb0eea06fd963f33242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BuildingWithBlocks"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
