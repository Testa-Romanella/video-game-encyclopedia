It's your lunch break, you've just returned from the cafeteria where you enjoyed a lovely salad.</p>\n<p>Upon your return to work, ALL OF THE PARKING SPACES ARE FULL JUST LIKE ALWAYS. Except one, but it's precariously placed and it's going to take all of your skill to get your car parked.</p>\n<p>But wait! There's a spot left, but it's not a normal parking space where you just drive in and suddenly you're in control. No, this one is active and hazardous, and to get back to the job site\u00a0in time for the next stakeholder meeting\u00a0\u00a0you're going to have to use all of your skill.</p>\n<p>The parking space is on a pendulum, and it swings back and forth depending on its balance. Sometimes weights randomly fall on to the parking space. Sometimes rockets fly in to it from below. Sometimes lemurs crawl across it. You can never know! You aren't in control!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adcac82df68451397a6d8c51583c92b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fpdotmonkey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
