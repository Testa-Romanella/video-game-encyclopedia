The player\u2019s only way to out-maneuver the monster is by using shortcuts that the monster can\u2019t follow. These shortcuts buy the player enough time to continue solving the puzzle of the room and escaping to the next. Each level has a lever that has to be activated in order to advance to the next level.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T05:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/83836812fb8851d58282d8ca2f38c742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MLeBlanc"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
