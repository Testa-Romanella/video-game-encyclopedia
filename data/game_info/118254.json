I have updated it a bit to remove some old animations that were unfinished and replaced it with something else. I also added a back up kill feature for the fire as there is a bug where the fire doesn't get destroyed properly.</p>\n<p>Everything should be self explanatory once loaded, the controls are next to each characters avatar. There is one known bug where the fire will be positioned and scaled incorrectly, but only happens in a few cases, I may come back to this and try to fix it but can't promise anything.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/492/492c211135b21f290f9106a05623c944.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Louca Coles"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
