Kill the enemy shapes and get new items and abilities. If you get enough of one item it becomes \"juiced up\" and gives more bonuses. Run around each level, survive and kill shapes, get more items and become powerful. Each run should feel different with opportunities to make different kinds of builds. There are several levels and bosses to beat. Play as different characters, each with unique mechanics and abilities. Some items you encounter may be better for a specific character. There are over 20 items.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T05:30:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a8d439a9e222ff77bcadbb6fbb6eca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mitch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Mitch"], "esrb_rating": null}
