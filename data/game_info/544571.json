Two more weeks of polish/bugfixes and here it is ! It surely could\u00a0be\u00a0improved\u00a0but\u00a0I\u00a0think\u00a0it's still\u00a0very\u00a0enjoyable\u00a0as\u00a0is.</strong></p>\r\n\r\nGame modes\r\n\r\nRandom race\r\n<p>Play against a few AIs over 3 Laps, nothing much to explain, each race is on a different track.<br/></p>\r\nDaily challenge\r\n<p>Every day at 00:00 GMT a new seed is generated. Every player has the same track and the goal is to be the fastest to complete a lap. No lap limit, you can play again and again until you've become the best player of the world...for one day !</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Using a X-Box game pad</strong>\n<br/>\r\nUsing the keyboard\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n<p>Despite the \"basic\" look, the game needs a \"real\" graphic card to properly handle some of the post process at a decent frame-rate. FYI, here is a performance table using a few different GPUs:</p>\r\nGPU<br/>ResolutionFPSGTX 3070<br/>1920 x 1200<br/>370<br/>GTX 1070<br/>1920 x 1200130<br/>GTX 760<br/>1920 x 1200<br/>50MX 150<br/>1280 x 720<br/>55Intel UHD 620*<br/>1280 x 720<br/>25\r\n<p>* On the intel GPU, the framerate was obtained removing all graphic options.</p>\n<p>I could not have tested the game on a 4K screen, I don't know if it will even run at such resolutions. Feel free to give me feedbacks.<br/></p>\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n<p>Even if tracks are procedurally generated, only 512 different tracks could be generated. But, heh, that must be enough.<br/></p>\r\nWarning\r\n<p>For\u00a0some unknown reason,\u00a0Windows\u00a0Defender\u00a0might\u00a0consider\u00a0the\u00a0exe as\u00a0a threat and you might need to set-up an exclusion rule.\u00a0I guarantee\u00a0there is\u00a0no\u00a0malware\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0game.</p>\r\nSupport\r\n<p> If you're having troubles/crashes, please let me know.
