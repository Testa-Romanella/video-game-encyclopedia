Can a parasite, who was born to kill, dream about the sky? The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future. After the series of wars and natural disasters, the living conditions on the Earth have become increasingly worse. The main character is a special kind of parasite called Radix (translated from the Latin as \u201croot\u201d). He has adapted to living despite the complexity of the world. Parasites live in the bowels of the Earth. They are all connected to a single network called the Tree. The Tree is a collective mind. It receives food and biological substances from the soil that prevents the race from dying. However, due to the poor ecological situation, the soil is no longer able to feed the whole parasite race.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main character needs to collect biological material so that the Tree and its species will not disappear from the planet. To do this, he must hunt victims and plant roots in their brains. But he must be careful: the outside world is a very harsh place. Without killing and replenishing his life force, the parasite can die quickly. But does he really want to kill, or he just has to?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a story-based 2D platformer with survival elements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7daf9e91ed8adbe85c0121ecef92964f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DcrDro", "ArtCrafter2999", "AlexColdfire", "pixel.mirant", "Ser_Ch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
