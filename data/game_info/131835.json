It would be your every day arcade runner, except for one thing: you control Cutezilla's attacks with your voice! Babble, screech, and RAWR your way to victory!<br/><br/>High pitch = Fireball (top row attack)<br/>Mid pitch = Swipe (middle row attack)<br/>Low pitch = Stomp (bottom row attack)<br/><br/>Challenge your friends and see who can get the highest score! (If you don't have friends, play in public and you'll definitely make some!)<br/><br/>Hear Me Rawr: B-Side was created as a submission for Summer Slow Jams #3, Alternative Control Schemes / The Illusion of Control.
