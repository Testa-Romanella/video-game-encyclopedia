After you've thrown it you'll have to run and get it in order to attack again. Don't forget you can\u00a0use the piercing throw to get rid of several enemies at once and if the brick ever ends up in a hard to reach spot you can always get it out of there by holding down the spacebar.</p>\n<p>My highscore is 580 and the first person to beat it gets free imaginary ice cream.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong><strong>WASD</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>Move.<strong><br/>LMB:\u00a0</strong>Throw.<strong><br/>RMB(hold):\u00a0</strong>Piercing throw.<strong><br/>SPACE:\u00a0</strong>Attract brick.<strong><br/>F:\u00a0</strong>Toggle fullscreen.<strong><br/>ESC:\u00a0</strong>Quit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0Me.<strong>Art:\u00a0</strong>Me.<br/><strong>Music:</strong>\u00a0Eric Matyas,\u00a0www.soundimage.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b25cde98b7005a6de4d4ee95fc031b79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YouDoYouBuddy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
