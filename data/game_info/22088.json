The main setting is forest again, but this time without snow, instead a more sunny and foggy weather. And there are more hills to climb.<br/>\r\nIt is a short and atmospheric puzzle game with narration.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay and puzzle system is similar to the original Nephise. There are animal skulls that you have to gather and then use on tall amphoras. You will be able to toggle the visibility of the HUD which will show you which animal skull and how many mushrooms you have gathered.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe music and atmosphere is relaxing like the original game. And the voice actor will be an elder one who will be narrating like telling the player a story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T08:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09387c63a3e0101f03b985d797c3460.jpg", "website": "https://tongucbodur.myportfolio.com/nephise-begins", "rating": 2.29, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 87, "owned": 1622, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 513, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 52, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "esrb_rating": null}
