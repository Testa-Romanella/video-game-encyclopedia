It needs YOU.</p>\n<p><strong>UNION\u00a0</strong>takes you into the journey of a wandering soul sent to a new world with only their name and a purpose given to them: to unite the people and dispel the chaos that has polluted the land. Create a vessel for the soul to inhabit, venture through the world, meet new people and unite them under your cause to save this world from evil.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Select - Z</p>\n<p>Cancel - X</p>\n<p>Sprint - SHIFT</p>\n\n<p>Currently Planned Features:</p>\n<p>- Character and weapon customization via items dropped by enemies</p>\n<p>- Class switching, allowing the player to learn new techniques\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Gacha system for unlocking new weapons, characters (no in-game purchases required)</p>\n<p>- A large roster of characters to join the player, each with their own personal skills and story arcs</p>\n<p>- An expansive, dynamic story that changes based on the player's decisions</p>\n<p>This is my first foray into game development, and the first result of over a year of work.\u00a0Development is slow (mostly due to me working on my own), but progress is being made each day.\u00a0The demo will offer roughly 1-3 hours of content, and the full game will offer much more.
