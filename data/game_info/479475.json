The very fabric of reality is stretched thin down here, and normal physics don't work quite right. Because of this, you can harness the power of gravity, though this comes with a few flaws.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in a position where you appear to\u00a0have no control, try flipping gravity or jumping. If that doesn't work, you can retry by opening the pause menu with the\u00a0space bar.</p>\n<p>I have detailed the controls below in case you forget them:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - O</p>\n<p>Flip - P + W/S</p>\n<p>Wall Grab - [</p><p>Pause - space</p>\n<p>Move through dialogue - O</p><p>And the more advanced tech. You don't need to know this yet:</p>\n<p>Wall Jump - [ + O</p>\n<p>Wall Hop - [ + hold towards wall + O</p>\n<p>Dash - P and A/D</p>\n<p>Long Jump - diagonally towards the ground + O</p>\n<p>Super Jump - hold towards the ground for up to two seconds to charge + O</p>\n\n<p>This is my first Game Jam, so please leave some feedback!</p>\n<p>And remember, if you're going to fall, at least make it in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Music by TheCHONK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee814b63deb6c2163035f9e9fbe7531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jacjson", "TheCHONK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
