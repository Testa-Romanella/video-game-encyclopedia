In order to create a healthy discussion, hopefully compelling a more prejudiced adult to reflect on its cultural bias gained trough a lifetime of misinformation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of the Play-session they both learn from the experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:08", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fernando Soares"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
