You play as Dave, a simple working man who just got home to start the game. The game isn't anywhere close to a finished product, the sound and dialog aren't finalized, and some assets could use reworking, but overall pretty proud of my accomplishment of a demo as I haven't been able to stick with a project for years. Constructive Criticism is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>A list of known bugs/unintentional design include: Scene switching taking longer than usual, dialog not being properly displayed, UI clipping off screen, and more</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:07:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d502102c33325d5c3afd8167cbb0918c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seul_Soul"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
