I wanted to add one extra mechanic for\u00a0<br/>when players smash into each other on the rails but couldnt get to it. Quite a bit more I wanted to do art wise\u00a0<br/>including another custom shader for the 3D models as well as way more 3D models to populate the city (ended up doing the 3D models I have in these last<br/>few hours today 8/30/2020). There is also no sound it just fell out of scope.<br/>I actually learned quite a bit that I am going to take back to my other personal project which is basically a harvest moon clone.<br/>I am grateful for the experience and had lots of fun hopefully whoever plays this enjoys it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Thanks Nick\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d901b584cbef0ad753bd81eb2c6ad1a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NickTheAutomata"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
