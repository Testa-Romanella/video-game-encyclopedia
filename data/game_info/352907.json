These use mashups that I had previously made; some good, some bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a bit old now, but I realized I never actually put it up anywhere once it was \"complete,\" so I figure I'll put it here for anyone who's interested.</p>\n<p>The crowds and some of the other art in the game is made by a buddy of mine: Josh Jerin.</p>\n<p>My only problems: This was before I really learned a lot of Music Visualization and Tech Art techniques, as well as generally better practices for better modeling, programming, etc. The worst part is that it only works in Virtual Reality -- even if I just made a first person character real quick, all the controls are meant for a Newton VR Rig, so it'd be impossible to recover at this point.</p>\n<p>If there\u00a0<em>is</em> a sequel, I would definitely push it even further with interested music visualizations and abstractions, make a more advanced music controller that looks better with more details and more functionality, a proper game/scoring system somehow, better scene lighting and of course a desktop mode.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Absolutely all credit to original music artists.\u00a0If your music appears in here and you do not want it to, contact me immediately.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d41a3aee66710ffa77505f8c1ca72b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiivas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
