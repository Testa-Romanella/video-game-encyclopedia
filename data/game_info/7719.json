But you aren&amp;#39;t the only ones trying to fly the coop!  Other countries are trying to break their men out, and the more prisoners that make it, the tighter security becomes.  Sacrificing stealth for speed isn&amp;#39;t always the answer though; if you leave items behind, you&amp;#39;ll run into trouble down the line. It&amp;#39;s a fast paced game of strategy as you follow the escape plans, break your allies out, dodge the guards, and get everyone to safety in Stalag 17.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/3784077706b9cd343a7fe6521e5e2e8d.jpeg", "website": "http://www.stalaggame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Silver Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Silver Apps"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
