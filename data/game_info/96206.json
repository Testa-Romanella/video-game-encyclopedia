Light switches appear as red buttons on the wall, and will periodically turn themselves off. Leaving a room in darkness will allow nightmarish creatures to rise from the floor and create ghastly noise. The noise meter in the bottom left of your screen indicates the current volume, and if the volume gets too loud... you'll wake up! So vanquish these threats to your dreams, keep those lights on and whatever you do, DON'T WAKE UP!</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed our game, please consider <strong>supporting us</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>This is the finalised and more polished\u00a0version of our GDL Jam entry which you can find here:\u00a0https://kejoku.itch.io/dont-wake-up-gdl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ce/1cecd1fe7dfc1e4ec8b5bbaf5f76d92c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Bitwise-Operations", "the_rembo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
