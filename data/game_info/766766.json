In this game we play as a fly who has a not very long list of things to do before death, and only 60 seconds to live. It seems impossible to check all of the goals in one\u2019s lifetime. However it can mate with other flies and create descendants, so the goals can be fulfilled by them. Can it live life to its fullest or should it leave unfinished jobs to its descendants? How many generations does it take to live a full life? :D</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The game is played with a keyboard, using arrow keys along with \u2018F\u2019, \u2018T\u2019.</p>\n<p>You can move the fly around with arrows, use \u2018F\u2019 to interact with interactable objects, and hold \u2018T\u2019 to check the list of goals.
