Mine resources, build structures, expand and purify the world!</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: this is an early prototype of the core gameplay. The purpose of this prototype is to test if the core idea of conquering territory is fun to toy with even with no obstacles or goals. For this reason expect the following:</p>\n<ul><li>No obstacles</li><li>No goals</li><li>No fancy graphics (even camera perspective will be different in the final version)</li><li>No juice, no polish</li><li>There is no even a title screen!</li><li>Some bugs</li></ul><p>Thanks to the latest feedback the following points were improved:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Buildings are now tied to hotkeys. Domes: 1, Towers: 2, Radars: 3, Storages: 4\r\n</li><li>Building mode now doesn\u2019t reset after each click, so you can keep building the same structure\r\n</li><li>Camera panning now works with WASD/Arrows keys. Funny thing it was already implemented in code, but for whatever reason the panning speed was set to zero. *facepalm*</li></ul>\n<p>If the prototype proves that players have some interest in the idea even with all the limitations above, the game will be met with further development.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Camera Zoom - mouse wheel</li><li>Camera Pan - WASD, arrow keys,\u00a0middle mouse button</li><li>Build/Select - left mouse button</li><li>Cancel/Deselect - right mouse button, ESC</li><li>Build a dome - 1</li><li>Build a tower - 2</li><li>Build a radar - 3</li><li>Build a storage - 4</li></ul>\n<p>Fullscreen is recommended!</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This game idea <strong>desperately needs your feedback</strong>! Please don't hesitate on leaving a comment, tell me what you liked about it, what you disliked about it, whether you had fun, and what prevented you from having fun. Every little bit helps!</p>\n<p>If this game idea gathers enough feedback and improvements, it will be developed into a full game. You can make this happen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2a6988cefeeb1b93fd4e3eb93f494bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["The Game Is Simple"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
