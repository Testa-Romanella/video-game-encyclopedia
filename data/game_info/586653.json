He begins exploring.

I would say I exhibited action-to-action and scene-to-scene in my world of time traveling. I used transition for the first time in my Bitsy game and it made my game look well put together and flow very well. Each scene takes the player to the next time frame. There should be somewhat of a thrill when inside the pyramid.\u00a0\u00a0Players\u00a0should be able\u00a0to imagine themselves in Egypt and needing to find something lost in a pyramid.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I found\u00a0 the theme park videos very interesting. The amount of time that is taken to sketch a plan, create a small layout of the plan, test and create rides, and eventually began building a theme park is very intricate. In order to design my world, I had to think of where I want my character to travel to and the type of experience I wanted him to have.\u00a0 This eventually led to the color patterns I included throughout my world, the ideas of each room, and adding in real historic content. With me choosing the characters time travel experience to be in Egypt, this made me think of Disney Lands use of traveling to a different land. I made sure\u00a0</strong>players understood\u00a0the game by using notable objects to\u00a0display the theme.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b9/9b9f61c2b903f12c6ee8b6e4415c8f5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itcreationz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
