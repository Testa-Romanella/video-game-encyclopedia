I wasn't quite able to finish that in time, so the game isn't really 'fun' or even playable yet really, and has plenty of bugs.</p>\n<p>I intend to go back to the original idea now that the jam is over and polish the game, fix bugs, do actual artwork, etc.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb806a79261d5cfa48254edd843c7b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
