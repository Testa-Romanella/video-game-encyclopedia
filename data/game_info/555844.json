On Tuesday week 1, we were given the prompt \"Road Trip - Cape Town\", and by Friday we had a prototype. You can play the week 1 version here:\u00a0https://games-by-harry-x.itch.io/the-cape-town-caper-part-1<br/><br/>On\u00a0 Tuesday week 2, we were given a bunch of helpful feedback and the 1 word prompt \"Water\". We decided to spend the next few days fixing bugs, adding polish and visual tweaks and, of course, water. Also lore. Deep lore.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who plays, to Andy and LSBU and especially to my team for working so hard, you guys were a pleasure to work with and made being a producer actually fun (which 3 years ago would have sounded impossible).</p>\n\n<p><strong>LADSONTOUR STUDIOS -\u00a0THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Alex -\u00a0</strong>Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Marcos</strong> - 3D Modelling &amp; Art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Eliot - </strong>3D Modelling, Menu Script\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hoang - </strong>3D Modelling &amp; Art:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/zerostyle_art/</p>\n<p><strong>Kasim </strong>- 3D Modelling + Particle FX\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jack - </strong>3D Modelling</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony</strong>\u00a0- Art</p>\n<p><strong>Tommy - </strong>SFX &amp; Art:\u00a0<strong>\u00a0</strong>https://tomiico.itch.io/</p>\n<p><strong>Act Ishikawa</strong> - Music<strong>:\u00a0</strong>https://twitter.com/ActIshikawa?s=20<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Harry </strong>- Producer/Captain:\u00a0\u00a0https://linktr.ee/linksbyharry\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:16:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61d/61da95d3dc408946615104607a76b201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Games By Harry x"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
