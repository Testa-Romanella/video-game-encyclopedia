The Windows version is simply there to try out if you don't have an Android device.</p>\n<p>This game is designed to be played by two people at once on a touchscreen device, however it does have a single player mode.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, an orange ball is dropped, and will fall through the platforms. Each player has a magnet which, when pressed, will pull the ball to their side of the screen and prevent it falling. The white balls belong to the player on the left, and the black balls to the right. The orange ball will collect balls it touches. The first player to collect all of their balls wins.\u00a0Only one magnet can be used at a time, and will be disabled after each use until fully recharged.</p>\n<p>Made by: Daniel Waddell (Programming, Art) and Aaron Ishibashi/tadashibashi (Music, Sound Design, Wwise Implementation).
