You will be immersed for hours as you try and complete 3 different in-built pictures, and you can load in your own pictures too, with 5 different levels of difficulty. The muddled cartoon pictures are of city buildings, a castle, and a girl with a kite. There is a nice background instrumental piece of music that loops perfectly, and a sound effect for each time you move a piece. The background music and sound effect can each be turned on or off. You think you have completed the level but you are not receiving a score, but hmmm! Maybe there is one or more pieces incorrectly placed. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/19674172ee299421ad1ef3be63f81134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yewtree"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
