This will take you to the previous passage. But if you do this, expect to see some audio bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/49425655ed23f49fa75cbf7ea4193ead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dogucan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
