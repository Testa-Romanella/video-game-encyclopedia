All of this takes place in a partially zero gravity arena where you have full control. You can switch between PC and VR mode at any time without restarting the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have the possibility to change almost everything during the round without having to create a new lobby. Be it the mode itself, or the number of AIs or how many players and spectators are allowed to join and more.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe arena also offers training opportunities as there is a complex AI that can block shots and swords, evade dangerous attacks and act tactically.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOf course, you also have the ability to block projectiles or enemy weapons because everything is based on physics.<br/>\r\nThis opens up a new world for physics-based sword fighting against real players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T02:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a737f628ecb2ad58fa4cd6d52d303de.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKLe_ThCR3XgbPPsx7hBfQ", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DespoDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DespoDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
