He named the robotic sphere \"The Box Finder\". The Box Finder (TBF) mission is going to the World Between Worlds (WBW) to get at least 3 boxes in the speed of light. So, you as TBF needs to collect 3 boxes to help ICSA Express. (Actually, you need to collect 30 boxes :D).</p>\n<p>My story is great, right?
