Be careful, designating a wrong person will result in his death for no reason.</p>It's a jam product<p>The game was designed in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2019. This year, the theme was simply \"<em>Only One</em>\". I built this game around the concept of finding the only one person that fits his description.\u00a0</p><p>The game uses colors and I'm sorry for every colorblind people that won't be able to fully enjoy the game. I haven't had the time to make a colorblind-mode.</p><p>As a side note, the game uses weird old-english for comedic purposes, it makes the hints harder to understand, but I think it's also a part of the game. There's no time limit to read the text so feel free go through the internet to get help. I made use of this tool to help me translate it :\u00a0https://lingojam.com/EnglishtoShakespearean</p>Technical notes<p>Each game is different, there are 102 characters on screen and each time the <em>only one</em> is another person. Every person is procedurally generated and depending on what he is wearing, the hints also change.</p><p>The game was developped with the Monogame Framework in c# with Visual Studio 2019.</p><p>The music is The Old Tower Inn by\u00a0<strong>RandomMind</strong></p>End note<p>Thanks for playing. I hope you enjoyed this silly game, feel free to comment anything and to rate the game, it helps me on my future projects !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221e271cb691cd10422d54d1ad560cc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quentin Delvallet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
