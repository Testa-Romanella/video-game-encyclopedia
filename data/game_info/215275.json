Instead you program the car so it drives itself!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You enter the code in an Input Field on the left side of the screen. After you have written you code you press the button below. The car resets itself, afterwards\u00a0it. executes your code. The goal is to\u00a0get in a certain amount of time to the finish line.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you get of the track the car resets itself and you have to rework your code<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Syntax explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>There are 3 commands to control your car!</p>\n<p><strong>acc :\u00a0</strong>with this command you control the speed of the car. For example if you type\u00a0 \u00a0\"acc 100\" then the car will speed or slow down to this speed.</p>\n<p><strong>rot:\u00a0</strong>with this command you rotate the car. If you type for example \"rot 0\" the car will rotate so that it is facing up, if you type \"rot 90\" it will face right and so on.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>pause:\u00a0</strong>with this command you pause the code for a certain amount of time. For example if you type \"pause 5\" it will wait 5 seconds until it runs the next command.</p>\n<p><strong>example Code:</strong></p>\n<p>acc 140<br/>pause 2.1<br/>rot 0<br/>pause 2<br/>rot 90</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9ac95a66e5d387ffc120efb4ab43fd73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KspPaul"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
