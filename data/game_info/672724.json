The balls will be thrown in the direction of the mouse, try hitting as many rings as you can before time runs out!</p>A quick prototype I created for Ludum Dare 49. Did you think that the mechanic of moving with the keyboard and \"juggling\" (directing the balls) with the mouse can work on a more realized game? I'd love to hear it! Didn't like it at all? That's okay too. :)<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/263/263996cb10d3d3f9742fb3cf193d813b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel Naves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
