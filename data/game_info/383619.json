Thankfully you have the guidance of a magical kraken that grants you time travel power. If only there wasn't a whole cast of crazy people attending the schools to distract you from your plans.<br/><br/>\u200bAs the new kid in school you figure out the routines of the characters to find a way to change their fate in this Groundhog Day-like adventure. Every student has their uniquely decorated room that you can snoop through to find out their secrets. Make friends and go on dates, like taking Broccoli Girl to the waterpark. Will time travel powers be enough to save the Armadillo Academy students?<br/><br/>In this adventure you are free to walk around the school grounds (keyboard and gamepad supported) and find hints to your quests by talking to people. Your calendar will keep track of the events. Be at the right place at the right time to uncover mysteries and receive quest items. Use these items at the right time to change the outcome and prevent disasters from happening.<br/>You have the option of spending time with your favourite characters on dates after gaining their favour through presents and giving the right answers in conversations. On these dates you will have to make sure to make the right decisions to make it as enjoyable as possible. On top of this you will play the dating minigame (Dance Dance Revolution-like rhythm game) to determine how successful of a date it will be. Do well to uncover more of the character's backstory.<br/><br/><ul><li> 3 Quests to solve through Time Travel Mechanics<br/></li><li> 20 Characters to befriend<br/></li><li> 3 Characters to go on dates with<br/></li><li> Full controller support</li></ul><br/>Average play time: 3 hours", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T03:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c17731f63f80509a905188a1bc93183.jpg", "website": "http://school-wars.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 179, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Happy Broccoli Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Happy Broccoli Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
