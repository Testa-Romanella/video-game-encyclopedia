Shoot objects, and\u00a0reverse them.\r\nThe reversal has a lot of potential for puzzles, unlocking new dangerous paths in a level,\u00a0 climbing buildings,\u00a0shooting opponents behind their backs while facing you, etc. There are 4 levels that loop.<br/><br/>\r\nTips:</p>\n<p>1. To reverse displaced objects hold the time reverse button.<br/><br/>2. Reversed bullets can be destroyed, otherwise, they will be destroyed after a few seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. Picking reversed bullets will allow the objects that were displaced by said bullets to revert completely to their initial state. Otherwise, the bullets will be fired again at greater strength.\r\n</p>\n<p>4. Last level, the cubes can only die by hitting them on the back.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T10:48:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82ee149c6d8a18867221183da9e0f6b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glasgow Caledonian University"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
