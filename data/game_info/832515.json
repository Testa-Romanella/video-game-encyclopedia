You may need to find some hamsters to get bigger and jump higher; or lose some hamsters to get smaller by running into cages.<br/>\n<br/>You can play by yourself by just hosting and then starting the game without any players connected, and play with two players locally.<br/><br/>Use the WASD keys to move around with W to jump. If you do not connect with someone online, you can also use the arrow keys as the second player's controls, to play together locally. You jump higher together so you need a second player to win!</p>\n<p>The host can press R to restart the current level at any point.</p>\n<p>Start the game by hosting in the \"Connection\" menu, <strong>you must have port 17451 forwarded to host outside of LAN. \u00a0</strong>You need to \"host\" to play local multiplayer. <br/><br/>If trying to connect to a host from the same LAN (e.g. connected to the same WiFi), run\u00a0<em> ipconfig</em> in command prompt on windows and have the host change their IP address before pressing \"Host\" to the \"IPv4 Address\" field from command prompt, which should start with \u00a0\"192.168.\" . If you're using a platform besides windows,\u00a0 I'm sure you can figure it out. (If you want a Linux version please ask! We were too lazy to set it up but one of our programmers developed on Linux, we will add it if someone needs it!)<br/><br/>Unfortunately since the game is direct peer-to-peer connection, some international connections have been shown not to work. We recommend if playing online to play with someone in your region.<br/></p>\n<p>Created for the 2022 Multiplayer Game Jam<br/></p>\n<p>Alexander Petshaft - Music<br/>Collin Anderson - Sound Effects<br/>Exuin - Programming<br/>Mike Belousov - Programming<br/>TheHibiscusPoet - Art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T11:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51b/51bd2d941e1b3a391f88d5e92552f60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["InTheWall", "TheHibiscusPoet", "canderson819", "pshaft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
