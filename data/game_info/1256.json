{"id": 1256, "slug": "xcom-2", "name": "XCOM 2", "name_original": "XCOM 2", "description": "<p>The game continues the previous game line: XCOM Enemy Unknown. In XCOM 2 we see the Earth under the rule of aliens. The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation&#39;s soldiers is now the alien ship &quot;The Avenger&quot;, converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.<br />\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.<br />\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2016-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T11:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9bf/9bfac18ff678f41a4674250fa0e04a52.jpg", "website": "http://www.xcom.com", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 477, "owned": 5280, "beaten": 681, "toplay": 210, "dropped": 490, "playing": 95}, "playtime": 15, "achievements_count": 401, "ratings_count": 1265, "suggestions_count": 644, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 1278, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "Linux"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "2K", "Firaxis"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
