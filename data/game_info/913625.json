Most of the work done so far has been establishing the scripting engine, which utilizes several resource file formats I've developed over the years for use in a variety of DOS/pre-Windows 2000 games. There are several screens currently included and a handful of game-specific text blurbs and parser commands.<em><br/>\n</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u2014the Lobdegg</em></strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Contact</strong>\n<p><strong>Mastodon:<br/>\r\nHadrosaurus Software</strong><em>\u00a0(development studio)</em><br/><strong>the Lobdegg</strong><em>, author</em></p>\r\nSupport us on Patreon!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T07:32:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/491d0ca289cb6d025c6b6315cff0e175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hadrosaurus Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
