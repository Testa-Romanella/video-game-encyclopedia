The Theme was Families on a Family trip.</p>\n<p>I focused on the Part where when families go on a trip, most of the time the children will be on the backseat either playing on their phones, watching a movie or sleeping.</p>\n<p>This game is meant to be played with 2 people. You play the game with 2 people on both sides of (preferably) an Android Tablet. one player needs to get the onion as far as possible and avoiding traps, while the other tries to get the onion to go Game Over by throwing a knife on top of him. (Don't worry, there's no gore. Just an onion)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e626f52ad8a06b960384ef2327b3fd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jaydee"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
