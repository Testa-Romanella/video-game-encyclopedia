Just press the Start button on the Main Menu).\u00a0 This game still has a lot of bugs, and is far from perfect (it's a prototype, duh).\u00a0 Keep that in mind.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>**UPDATE** A fellow staff member has showed interest, so I decided to pick the project back up and do a few desperately needed updates (mostly things that were already in the code, but not implemented properly). \u00a0Thanks Brett! See the DevLog for details.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>**UPDATE 2.0** I've finished up on this project, on to bigger and better things. \u00a0Version 1.0 is available, and unless there's something seriously game-breaking in there (please let me know if there is), I have a feeling I'm not going to touch it again. \u00a0Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c488753ffb9991ab6614bfe1b6f3e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FFS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
