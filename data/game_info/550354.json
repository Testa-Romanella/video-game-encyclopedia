Made for the Gotm Jam #1 by a solo dev, destroy a pixelated galaxy as you grow bigger and bigger. You play as the singularity, a wandering black hole making its rounds through the stars. Collect stardust as you make your way through the cosmos, slinging yourself around planets and growing ever larger. Consume everything from the smallest satellite to the densest star on your journey to be the last matter standing. And don't forget about the cow.</p>\n<p>Note: There is a need to refresh the page if the game is lost. This is an issue with Gotm (where the game is hosted)\u00a0that did not come up during testing on my localhost.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a3106fe586ac0840aa541121088cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mad Gnome"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
