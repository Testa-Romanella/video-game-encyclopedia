A whole lot of chaos ensues and you have to defeat Kars before he reaches Earth.</p>\n<p>Developer Notes<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The online version has lag, especially with sound. Save state might also be wonky and the sprite moves a bit faster than usual. The downloadable version of the game is the best working one, so try that if you have any issues.</li>\n<li>If you get an error that says \"wasm instantiation failed,\" play it in a new tab by clicking here.
