Stay strong and defeat the 100 incoming monsters to end up standing as the <strong>Last one in town</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The enemies will try to eliminate your hearts one by one, but you can regain them by defeating your foes. Create your plan and try to execute it carefully, while the adrenaline rush increases the randomness and takes the control away from you. Everything while balancing the pressure that firebolts of level 5 or higher toll on your body.</em></p>\n<p>(Made for the GMTK 2022 game jam)</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam this year was \"Roll of the dice\". Some years ago (for another edition of the jam), I made a type of parkase that also included a dice, so I wanted to do something different this year. The game fits the theme by having all the attacks depending on the rolling of the dice, but the twist is that the player decides when the dice stops. Not only that, but the dice changes more and more quickly as you progress in the game. And, as final details, you choose the maximum value that the dice can take and values higher than 4 put you at risk.\u00a0I think that it ended up having a good balance, but there's probably lot of room for improvement and additions (also, didn't have to add a tutorial).</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<ul><li>https://pipoya.itch.io/\u00a0for it's beautiful\u00a0FREE RPG Monster Pack</li><li>https://opengameart.org/users/ansimuz\u00a0for it's\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-town-pixel-art-assets</li><li>David Renda for the amazing music\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/boss-time/2340</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93d4e4bf48e3f017997650d60ee69641.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jorvan"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
