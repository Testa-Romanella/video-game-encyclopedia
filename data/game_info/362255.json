With no other option, you must fight them off. However, your only weapon is the very soul-flame that keeps you alive. Use your soul as a weapon, but keep it close. It is your only method of survival.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Overview------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Pith is a top-down 2D bullet hell shooter. Your soul is your only bullet; but, it is also your only health point. After shooting it, make sure you pick it back up. While the soul-fire burns, you cannot be harmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong> <em>WASD/Arrow Keys</em></li><li><strong>Aim:</strong> <em>Mouse</em></li><li><strong>Shoot:</strong> <em>Left Mouse Button</em></li><li><strong>Recall Soul-Fire:</strong> <em>Hold Left Mouse Button</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dev Notes------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam.</p>\n<p>The theme: Only One.
