Truly a wise decision by our Dear Leader! Following the\u00a0<em>resignation</em>\u00a0of your predecessor, it is now upon you, to lead our national space program to triumph! While the program might lack some \u201cwestern luxuries\u201d like money, technology, know-how or experience, our proud nation will succeed with pure willpower and determination, as well as the help of our Dear Leader! Travel to the stars, Kamerad! Conquer the planets! And carry forth our glorious cause to the galaxies! For our Dear Leader, for mighty Strakholia! And remember:\u00a0<strong>we can and we must move constantly forward!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As the Chief Engineer of the Strakholian space program your job is to reach for the moon! Quite literally. On your 2-bit screen, you control the rockets on their way to the planets. Since the program is severely lacking in money and technology, at first your rocket has only one button and a limited amount of fuel, so you must rely heavily on planetary trajectories and the gravitational pull of surrounding planets to reach your goal. The planets you have to reach are getting further and further away, so the routes you\u2019ll have to take are getting longer and more complicated each mission. One late button press, one false ignition one wrong turn might strand your cosmonauts in space. Don\u2019t disappoint the Dear Leader on our glorious march forward.</p>\n<p>Constantly Forward is a game developed for the Video game Design and Programming course at the Politecnico di Milano.
