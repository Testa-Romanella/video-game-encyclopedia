He's a prince but in his forgetfulness he's misplaced his crown\u00a0 and sadly, has locked all the doors between him and his crown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since it's late at night he must to make it past all the angry guards that he's woken up and avoid the spikes that for some reason are spread out throughout the castle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take a leap of faith and find the keys needed to open the gates to find his lost crown.<br/></p>\n<p>Each key will provide something special on this midnight jaunt.\u00a0One key opens the gate(the key with the crown), one helps you jump higher, and one makes it so you can move around without having to jump first. Notice you don't necessarily need all three keys to open the gate. They'll just make it easier.\u00a0\u00a0If you can\u2019t quite jump onto a platform, try rotating to see if that helps ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Avoid hitting the spikes and angry guards or else you'll lose all your progress and\u00a0have to start the level all over again.</p>\n<p>The About page holds the keys on how to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b372263324bedfb883dc0dbc51045547.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pikkulyo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
