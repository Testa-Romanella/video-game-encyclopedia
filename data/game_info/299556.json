You can also further enhance the stats most important to you with a stat modifier feature. Customization goes beyond your Soul Tech as you can, of course, key bind your controls to your liking - we take it, firing all those weapon won't always be so easy for everyone.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-11T11:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d687e1f7bd85d7e4eb5e5449eee0e70.jpg", "website": "https://www.MustImagine.com/soultech", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Must Imagine Entertainment", "mustimagine"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Must Imagine Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
