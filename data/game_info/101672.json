This Winter Jam we made <em>Nice to meet you</em>, but with\r\n only 36 hours for development we opted to make a speed dating \r\nsimulator. So come with us and have a date... or six with these peculiar\r\n characters.\r\n</p>\n<p>For this project veterans and newbies joined forces using Unity and custom software made by our programmer Rho. \r\n</p>\n<p>Nice to meet you is played by selecting text options with your mouse.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Programmers: Rodrigo Perez, Santiago Rosas Caissiols<br/>Art: Mariana Mintegui, Santiago Olivares, Jose Antonio Borba<br/></em><em>Music by: Steve Combs, Ondrosik</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b485313c524a1189f893337da370194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MayaMint", "freakrho", "El Sato", "yosh0"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
