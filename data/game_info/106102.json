The more you have, the faster the Weapon will fire.</p>\n<p>The Accelerator increases the power of your Weapon, you'd want many for a sniper rifle or cannon like Weapon.</p>\n<p>The Projectile will survive longer with more parts.</p>\n<p>(This was the gun design tutorial that was in game previously.
