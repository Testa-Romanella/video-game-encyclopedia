{"id": 670779, "slug": "rhythm-land", "name": "Rhythm Land", "name_original": "Rhythm Land", "description": "<p>Test your sense of rhythm by hitting buttons to the beat in\u00a0a variety of groovy games! Skateboard, sing, cook, battle, and more with good timing.</p>\n<p>Made for GB Compo 21.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this game is lacking in polish, and isn't quite what we had imagined it would be. Because of that, this game <em>may</em> see continued development after the compo (but no promises!). We hope it's currently in at least a  decent state!</p><p>WARNING! v1.0.0 of the game (state as of the compo deadline) has some bugs. They will hopefully be fixed soon.<br/></p>\n<p>This project is open-source! It is licensed under the MIT License.\u00a0See\u00a0the GitHub repository\u00a0for the source code, build instructions, and more.<br/></p>\r\nPlaying the Game\r\n<p>To play, download the Game Boy\u00a0ROM image file\u00a0named 'rhythm-land.gb'. It can be written to a cartridge to play on real hardware or run in emulators such as SameBoy, bgb, Emulicious, or others. Being a game designed for the DMG, it will run on all Game Boy models.</p>\n<p>Note that there may be some delay when playing in an emulator for various reasons, such as audio latency or input latency. Look into those things if you're having an issue. Sorry, but it's not our fault!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n<ul><li>martendo\u00a0\u2014 Programming, Music &amp; SFX\r\n</li><li>eat_butt_loser_butt\u00a0\u2014 Art, Design\r\n</li><li>St\u00e9phane Hockenhull\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Game Boy Tracker\r\n</li><li>Bob Koon (BlitterObject)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0SoundSystem sound driver\r\n</li><li>Eldred Habert (ISSOtm)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0gb-vwf text engine</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82954f191d485f6afb094a77a9746fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["martendo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
