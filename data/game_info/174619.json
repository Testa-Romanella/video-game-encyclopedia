But careful! The battle has a night and day system: during the day, you battle Hades but during the night, he retreats in his underworld and sends minions to battle while he's away. Luckily, killing those minions can give you back some health, give you a damage boost or shield boost so you're all prepared when the day comes again and you have to fight back Hades.</p>\n<p>So team up with your friends and see how long you can survive in the arena!</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>\n\r\nThe artists:\u00a0\r\n<p>Michael Tavernier</p>\n<p>Nicolas Bluj</p>\n<p>Marie Jockmans</p>\n\r\nThe programmers:\u00a0\r\n<p>Viktor Blomme\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laurens Moonens\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2efb001e0b55bfadbfeab2a5a85600a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarieJ"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
