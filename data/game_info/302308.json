Trust, when we say your patience WILL be tested. In Spin Evolution you will control a ball and maneuver your way through a course completing obstacles and challenges. Each course will progressively get harder as you advance. As levels get harder, checkpoints will start to emerge to help soothe the frustration of starting over. As you complete courses your best record time will be saved, as will your ghost, so you can return later to compete against yourself or your friends with the best set record. As you progress you will go through different environments starting from a nice day in the middle of the ocean, advancing all the way to the lava filled chambers of the harshest volcano's. How far can you make it?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711d07a556b4cca260be2e8f40bd5f89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bruce Osborne"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dareapers Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
