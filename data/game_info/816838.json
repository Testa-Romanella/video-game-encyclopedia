Defeat the heroes with hired monsters, clever traps, and an ever expanding empire.\r\n </p>\n<p>My Infamous Dungeon is a tactical, card-based dungeon builder. Take  time to carefully plan your dungeon, then lure in waves of heroes to try  their luck in defeating your Dungeon Boss. <br/></p>\n\r\nManage your monsters\r\n<p>Draw monster cards and hire them with gold. Place each monster  carefully, as their unique abilities are maximized with proper  positioning.\r\n </p>\n<p>Treat your employed monsters well by giving them powerful Artifact  cards with new abilities. For your favorite monster, promote them to  Dungeon Boss, a mighty creature that\u00a0every\u00a0hero\u00a0dreams\u00a0of\u00a0defeating.\r\n </p>\n<p>Monsters can be combined to transform into deadly Level 2 monsters.  Or let them level up the old fashioned way, by slaying heroes for EXP. <br/></p>\n\r\nPlan your dungeon\r\n<p>Rooms can be added to your dungeon by connecting to any open doorway  on the 2D dungeon grid. Layouts can be a twisting maze of dead-ends, a  linear gauntlet of horrors, or anything in-between. <br/></p>\n\r\nDefeat the heroes\r\n<p>Waves of heroes will spawn on your command. They'll battle their way  through your dungeon for an attempt to take down the Dungeon Boss.\r\n </p>\n<p>Defeated heroes drop gold and loot, which upgrade your monsters and  expand the dungeon. If you're feeling bold, Double Down to strengthen  the next hero wave, and increase the sweet, sweet loot. <br/></p>\n\r\nGrow your infamy\r\n<p>Complete missions and challenges to earn Infamy. Use that Infamy to  flex on your friends, then also use it to unlock new monsters, upgrades,  and artifacts. Take those unlocks into even more dangerous missions,  and grow your Infamy further. <br/></p>\n\r\nPrototype Gaming\r\n<p>My Infamous Dungeon is just a prototype. It's rough, likely horribly  buggy, and the UI is sketchy. Oh, and feel free to add your own sound  effects. There's none of that included.\r\n </p>\n<p>The future of the game will be directly shaped by players. That means share your feedback loud and often! <br/></p>\n<p>Feedback to share?
