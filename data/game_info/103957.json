These are divided into armor classes: \"cloth\" with light armor, \"leather\" with medium armor, and \"plate\" with heavy armor.<br/></p>\n<p>The race and class of the player determines the skills they can access. <em>Phoenix Reborn</em> uses a skill-based combat system, whereby players must select only a limited number of skills from a much larger pool, introducing an element of strategy. However skill slots have predefined roles: the first ten are determined by player's weapon and class, the others are for healing and skills with no defined roles that are unlocked as the game progresses. Ultimately there will be\u00a0 slot sfor powerful \"elite\" skills, which is also initially locked.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>In addition to the small-scale, tactical combat described above, the game features \"Open World PVP\", large scale combat taking place in a persistent world. Players are able to construct siege weapons, with rewards commensurate with their success.</p>\n<p>This is a very early pre-alpha prototype to showcase some gameplay features and mechanics! Everything is WIP and will change in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>Keybindings:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>I : open iventory</li><li>E : use potion</li><li>LMB : normal attack</li><li>RMB : skill attack</li><li>Mouse Wheel : switch weapons</li><li>LShift : dodge roll</li><li>Tab : DEBUG mouse cursor</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57d3490dafd8579e0959459d98d9a05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExCineribus-Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
