But don't neglect your duty of transporting the cryogenically frozen survivors and preserved embryos of those immune to B99 to their new home one light-year away. You might let your ship run while you continue to enjoy your simulation, or you may actively improve the performance of your engines. It's up to you; you're the only human awake for the next few decades.</p><p>The initial release, 2020-11-08, is free to play in browser.
