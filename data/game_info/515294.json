I'd never made a game before, but it is something I am interested in and gaming is one of my passions. This is the first game I've made, and the first time I've used a game engine in this manner. It's not great, but I learned a lot about the Godot engine, and I think my next project is going to be a great improvement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59dbf80eb9f397682555715b924537f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DeeBabyGG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
