Many join it only to perish soon after in the search of glory. You are one of these mighty heroes, in pursuit of valour and heroism. How far will you go? Will you shatter before you have reached your potential, or will you reach Crystal Ascension?</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Crystal Ascension is a bullet-hell top-down shooter, with many randomized elements. Level up by gathering randomized upgrades with multiple tiers and an ever increasing value increase, which always have a positive and a negative status change to them. The difficulty of the game increases as you play, with no ceiling. As the game progresses, enemies will get increasingly more difficult, and more types of enemies will also spawn. Try to survive, upgrade, and beat your own high score!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow Keys - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse Left Click - Shooting</p>\n<p>Space - Pick up Upgrades</p>\n<p>Tab / P - Pause Game / View Stats</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:19:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b2f2affff13e4467dd68133db3508b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jesnuka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
