Originally, it was a prototype by <strong>@netcell</strong> and <strong>@vunq90</strong> for\u00a0<strong><em>Construct 3 Game jam</em>,</strong> featured a short narrative about Love triangle and visualized into gameplay by the interaction of 3 magnetic entities.</p>\n<p>However, its mechanic has a lot of flaws. We wanted\u00a0to fix it, add a few levels and polish it but never had time for that, so it was scrapped. Now I bring it to pico-8, simplify it, remove the narrative and multiple-choices ending, adjusting some level as well. Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Stage\u00a0Goal:</strong></p>\n<p>Get one ball to the maze entrance\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player uses Arrow keys to move all balls in desired direction</li><li>Player cannot control the balls while they are still moving,\u00a0the balls will not stop unless they hit an obstacle</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e46c5e5f8eba2207cd956d1f3902f16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krad"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
