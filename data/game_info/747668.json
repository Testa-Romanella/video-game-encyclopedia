The \"S\" key is for moving down platforms.</p><p>\"Part of the Truth\" is a platformer where there are two characters you can switch between throughout the levels. The red cube character can't see all of what's around them. The player may need to switch to the purple cube character to see the\u00a0things around the red cube character.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game jam and I\u00a0don't know a lot about Unity. This game definitely has some bugs!
