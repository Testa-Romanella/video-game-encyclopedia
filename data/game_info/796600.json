Please note, as this game is in development, many of the features are currently not implemented and/or do not work properly. <strong>Demo link at the bottom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game is inspired (heavily) by the classic WRPG series Might and Magic, as well as some others. In the final game you will have an entire world to explore with numerous towns, dungeons, quests, and a story that will have plenty of classic Might and Magic-style twists.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game will include a robust inventory and skill system, as well as an ability system.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of NPCs, each with their own dialogue trees and personalities. Many will train your skills to the next rank, if you are able. Some will start quests.</p>\n\n<p>Enemies have their own strengths and weaknesses, determine how best to fight each one.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Don't forget the loot!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As noted above, this game is currently in development. The demo prototype covers the starting town and two dungeons only (as of 5/2022). Nearly all of the assets are free UE4 marketplace assets, and most icons were sourced from game-icons.net and fantasy-faces.com.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you play the demo, please feel free to leave any critiques, comments, concerns, and importantly any bugs you've experienced. Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T14:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d3886af44003cf6f9598f9090e2250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skittzo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
