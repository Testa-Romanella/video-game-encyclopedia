{"id": 482375, "slug": "platypus-ii", "name": "Platypus II", "name_original": "Platypus II", "description": "<p><em>Platypus II</em> is the sequel to Platypus. Just the like the original game it is a horizontally scrolling shooter where the player controls an aircraft to protect the inhabitants of Mungola from the invading Collosatropolians. The game largely has the same mechanics as the original game, but the original developer was not involved. The game supports up to three players working cooperatively on a single screen.</p>\n<p>The game consists of five worlds split up into five levels each. The ship can be hit multiple times and there are credits to continue playing when all lives are lost. There are different difficulty levels and at the start of the game one of four shooting configurations can be chosen. Defeated enemies often leave behind fruit for extra points. The game still has the star system, where defeating an entire squadron is rewarded with a star. There are different colours and each type provides a new, temporary weapon such as a laser beam, rapid fire, rockets, spread fire and more. The colour of the star can be changed by shooting it before picking it up. Sometimes balloons appear carrying crates. Shooting these is rewarded with side cannons, money for more points or an extra life. At the end of the fifth area of a level a boss needs to be defeated.
