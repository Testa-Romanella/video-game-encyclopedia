{"id": 662626, "slug": "stack-project", "name": "Stack Project", "name_original": "Stack Project", "description": "<p>Remenber that old game named Stack Attack, playable on these old solid rocks of a mobile phone by Siemens?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Stack Project\u00a0</strong>is my recreation of that ancient\u00a0entertainment classic.</p>\n\r\nDeveloping this:\r\n<p>It's my first game that i was proud enough to finish a playable version\u00a0to publish.\u00a0The game is the product of my learning process with Unity, so it's far away from being optimized besides Unity's automated stuff they do. But I would say while playing you probably don't\u00a0notice that.</p>\n\r\nThe Game:\r\n<p>As mentioned above this game is a recreation. As such I tried to keep look and feel as close to the original as possible. I oriented myself at the game version from the Siemens ME45, C45 or A50. Therefor I keeped the orange/brown-ish LCD optic. For the graphics and\u00a0animations\u00a0I used some youtube videos of the original game and some of\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0features I built in from my own memory playing the game as a kid.<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Story:\r\n<p>While developing I had so much fun, that I added a pinch of secret story to the game.<br/>It's hidden, but not too hard to find... I hope so.\u00a0:D</p>\n\r\nHow to Play?\r\n<p>Some cranes are dropping boxes from above. Avoid being crushed underneath. You can push a box sideways. If the bottom row is full, the row explodes and a new crane is added, making the game harder and harder. There's no highscore system\u00a0right\u00a0now, like in the original.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Keyboard:<br/>Walk - A/D<br/>Jump - W or Space<br/>Diagonal - Q/E<br/>Reset - Esc<br/>Quit - Esc\u00a0(Doubletap)</li><li>Keyboard (alternate):<br/>\r\nWalk - Num 4/6<br/> Jump - Num 8<br/>Diagonal - Num 7/9</li><li>(Xbox)\u00a0Gamepad:<br/>Walk -\u00a0Left Stick<br/>Jump - A<br/>Diagonal - Shoulder Buttons or X and B<br/>Reset - Start<br/>Quit - Start (Doubletap)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6ba32946c12ada19a65b222af99d1ede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Masterpiet98"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
