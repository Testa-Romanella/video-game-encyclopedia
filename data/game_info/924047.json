You're playing as a figure (a square, a triangle, or a circle), and each figure has its own abilities. The circle can teleport to the point you placed, the square can shoot, and the\u00a0triangle can use a grapple gun. You have to platform, and kill enemies and bosses of course! So this game is simple and not too complicated. I hope you'll enjoy it! Good luck!</p>\n<p>[By the way, read the \"About\" section in the game to figure out controls and some game mechanincs]</p>\n\n<p>There is some of the game's soundtrack:</p>\n<p>https://on.soundcloud.com/hNLcS<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/475/475eb936b4a6787d40b2cb612ca0c2d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["noname_tretiak"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
