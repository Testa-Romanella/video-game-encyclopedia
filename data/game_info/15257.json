You have the ability to shoot red blocks to expand or retract them, but you can only expand three at a time, so you must manage your energy wisely. The red blocks can be used in many different ways, like for example, making platforms, but also blocking lasers, holding doors open, powering systems and propelling yourself.<br/><br/>The game lasts for about 40 minutes to 1 hour+, depending on the player, and was developed by me in Unreal Engine 4, as my final project at NAD university in Montreal. I've worked on the game 7 days a week for 15 weeks.<br/><br/>Red Trigger also won the prize of \"Choice of the Industry\" at ImagiNAD in May 2016.<br/><br/>To see any updates on patches or new games I make, you can follow me on Facebook or <br/>Twitter<br/><br/>The soundtrack is available here<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Credits :<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Developer</strong> - Maxime V\u00e9zina</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Sound Designer</strong> - Gabriel Essiambre</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Mentor</strong> - Maxime Chapleau</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Weapon Animations</strong> - Florin Popescu</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Voice</strong> - Lydia Gosselin</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Community Badges/Emotes</strong> - Gabriel Fleury</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-27T20:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df32529756c9f0cf15548c1ac6992f27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.41, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 436, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxime V\u00e9zina"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Maxime V\u00e9zina"], "esrb_rating": null}
