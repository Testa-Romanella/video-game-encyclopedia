For now, it's your basic RTS featuring ants in a disgusting low-res 3d-style. But some of these ants don't want to take your queen's shi* no mo'.</p>\n<p>So prepare for your underling buggers to revolt against you in hilarious fashion.</p>\n<p>Depending on the feedback, I might keep this thing running as a fun side-project. But it will be on hold during the Wowie 2020 rating phase.</p>\n<p>It's current state is pure chaos. Nothing is really tested, but I guess all bugs are intentional after all. I'm not even certain all songs are working. If you want to try the song section of the game again quickly, without having to go through all the RTS stuff, you'll have to restart the program, click away the first dialog and then press f1 while your cursor is on your queen. The crazy rave ants will be coming for you.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, the only version available is for Windows x64, because playing MIDI files cross platform is a nightmare. If you have some idea on how to do that, message me.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated, even if its just pointing out the typos that I already know about. I'll be fixing it after the voting is done (unless people can literally not run it), cause it would not be fair to change stuff during that phase.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Playing the game<br/></p>\n<p>I'm sure nobody will figure out how to play this, even with the ingame guidance by the main character. To get started, click through the initial dialog and select the queen by left clicking on her. Then in the bottom left, her status will display two buttons. Your goal is to get 3 Harvesters. Build them. You have played an RTS before, you should know how this works.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba8f4365b7f95b00b901a1319fef9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JayTea_O_o"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
