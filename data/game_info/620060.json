I'm really glad I was able to finish most of what I intended for the project. Its a 2D \"defend the earth\" style game, the theme of the Jam is \"Joined Together\" so I went with the gravity connection between the Earth and the Moon! Spinning the earth can launch the moon around, and the poles of the earth happen to work like perfect paddles to slap it into invading UFO's. If the Moon goes too far away you can use gravity to bring it hurtling back. I hope you like the game and please comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb5b0c34898d23b65543ac4613213973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rad Potato"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
