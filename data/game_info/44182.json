Most of the remaining humanity lives in several fortified cities scattered around the globe, while the rest roam the land as bandits or scavengers. Along with a team of scientists you have been entrusted with the task to build and maintain a facility, that aims to gather and preserve many species of animals and plants possible for a future re-population. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game starts with you locked down in quarantine, recovering from a severe infection, just hours after a band of raiders attacked and destroyed your base. Left alone with nothing but a small knife you will have to decide between rebuilding the facility by yourself or just find a way to survive day after day in hope of finding a safe place.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390c50f60c9d2a37c328773ae2ea8fac.jpg", "website": "http://www.animallica.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 32, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 484, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRIO Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CRIO Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
