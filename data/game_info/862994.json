And for that you must manipulate the rotation of mirrors to control the direction of the light, and prisms to control the color of the light.</p>\n<p>To interact with the elements that manipulate light, just click with the MOUSE.</p>\n<p>But be aware: Every 10 seconds, the color of the light source will change, between red, yellow and blue.</p>\n<p>Mirror: When clicked, its light reflection angle changes.</p>\n<p>Prism: When clicked, it rotates, and its color changes. The resulting color that will come out of the prism will be the sum of the color of the input ray and the color of the prism.</p>\n<p>Example: Blue light with red prism, will generate a beam/ray of purple light.</p>\n<p>Colors that can be made: Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple and Green.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e5788020a63ae98c70a10a1492e25bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["vphyre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
