The game heavily features clowns, though very few of them make focused attempts at being funny. The combat system does not incentivize mashing attack or random skills, instead insisting that you respect and properly utilize each party member's strengths. But if that sounds <strong>BORING </strong>then there's a cheat code to let you just one-shot most enemies. Oh yeah, there are cheats codes.</p>\n<p>Created for the '30 Day RPG Maker Themed Game Jam #5'.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T07:55:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/840cea255c3a19b2a8d59e929ce4ffd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lannael"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
