It's a classic JRPG with (attempts at) comedic writing and timing-based minigames to spice up combat. Play as a sarcastic demon just trying to get the hell back to... hell after a bunch of idiot cultists drag him to the mortal realm.\u00a0 The main storyline is short and snappy, designed to be completed in about 1-3 hours, but there's a lot of room for grinding if you want to get the most out of the systems and fight the tough optional boss (maybe around 8-10 hours if you want to get the max out of it). Likewise, the game is balanced such that, once you figure it out,\u00a0you can essentially choose how hard you want to make it on yourself. If you're having trouble, just remember to stay hydrated when you go adventuring!</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking it out. I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>The Summoning was made using RPG Maker MV.</p>\n<p><em>Content warning:\u00a0</em><em>There's a bit of crude humor and potty language, but it's not overly-sweary. And, you know, you play as a demon, if that kind of thing bothers you.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T03:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c94e76d6c9cf9cdfb54ec7f6710493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NWeissGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
