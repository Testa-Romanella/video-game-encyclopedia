There are 20 missions which are divided in a Korean and a Japanese campaign. Similar to other real-time strategy games the workers harvest vegetables which are used to construct buildings. In turn these are used to build combat walking, swimming or flying combat units which are used to defeat the enemy.</p>\n<p>The game has its fair share of micromanagement because the player can only assign one construction order to each factory - he has to wait until the current order is complete before he can assign another one. The enemy gets reinforcements in regular time intervals in the form of airborne troops which are thrown into the player&#39;s base.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-17T19:48:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f56616a21b0335c966209f4c25a74da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H.Q.Team"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["CDV Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
