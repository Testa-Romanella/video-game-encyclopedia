The aliens are trying to look like Fluffy, so you have to find the real one.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each game, Fluffy will be randomly set to be a white/brown, dog/cat with round/pointy ears and with/without spots.</p>\n<p>If any of shape shifting aliens touch you, you die. If you kill Fluffy, you lose.</p>\n<p>You can move around with WASD or the left stick of an XBOX style controller and fire your laser gun with Ctrl or the A button on the controller.</p>\n<p>I am really happy with the idea for this game, but didn't have quite enough time to really polish it, so I'm hoping to do a bit more work on it.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/375/375cf95bc3b1193936baf071de9e4fdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arnklit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
