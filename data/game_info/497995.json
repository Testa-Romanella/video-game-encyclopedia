{"id": 497995, "slug": "rogue-snow-everwinter", "name": "Rogue Snow: Everwinter", "name_original": "Rogue Snow: Everwinter", "description": "Rogue Snow is a top-down shooter with light survival and crafting elements.  Six months have passed since the Everwinter began.  The USA is a near empty wasteland coated in snow.  An army of living snowmen known as the Droves roam the land stalking anything with a temperature.  Douglas, a young boy who's been on his own for a month, joins up with a camp of survivors who believe that the equator may still be a safe haven from these monsters and climate.  They head south using a snow treader, and as the camp's sole scavenger, it's up to Douglas to provide for the camp and keep them safe.  But a faction of bandits holds the south with a tight grip, and their leader has other plans for Douglas' group. <br/><br/><strong>Singleplayer Story:</strong> A freak accident has left you as the sole scavenger for a group of survivors trying to reach the equator.  Your camp will provide you safety and the opportunity to craft much needed supplies, but every day has a mission for you to do to ensure the camp makes it farther south.<br/><br/><strong>Drove Mode:</strong> Go solo, or bring a friend as you try to survive against 20 waves of snowmen.  Scavenge by day, they'll come for you at night.<br/><br/><strong>VS Mode:</strong> One player controls a scavenger, gathering weapons and supplies to survive.  The other controls a snow sculptor, building an army of snowmen to command.  Their goals are the same: destroy the other player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T01:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/260df26218b59864722b8be43df84b0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael A.
