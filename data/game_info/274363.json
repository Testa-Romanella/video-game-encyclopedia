{"id": 274363, "slug": "blight-tower", "name": "Blight Tower", "name_original": "Blight Tower", "description": "<p>Welcome to Blight Tower! Your goal is to destroy the monstrous BLIGHT TOWER! Stand under OUTPOSTS to capture them and spawn an army of DEADLY CAPSULES! Be warned, the BLIGHT TOWER has a powerful BLAST ATTACK that does heavy damage and turns your DEADLY CAPSULES against you! Don\u2019t die!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So where's the incorporation of the 'Sacrifice' theme, you ask?\u00a0Simple:\u00a0If you find yourself running low on HEALTH, shoot rockets at a nearby DEADLY CAPSULE. There's a chance it will drop HEALTH for you upon death. Be advised, running out of DEADLY CAPSULES will lose you the game!</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve played a shooter in the 20 [twenty] years, you\u2019ll pick this up no problem. Otherwise, it\u2019s W, A, S, and D to move, mouse to aim, and left click to shoot your shot.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: While the game is technically feature complete, I ran out of time to work on my wishlist of audio and visual deliverables (note: the DEADLY CAPSULES). Many assets are still placeholders. There are also several bugs, as of writing. I have opted out of the Audio category, as the only sound in the game is for the rocket launcher. I have also opted out of the Humor category as it doesn\u2019t fit the theme of the game. I did opt into graphics as the models are custom made and the level design is (mostly) done.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Rockets do not change color to reflect player/environment ownership</li><li>Capsule mobs/bots do no change color to reflect player/environment ownership</li><li>Capsule mob/bot AI is pretty jank, but I made this in under 48 hours. Cut me some slack.</li><li>The WebGL version may not play? I\u2019m hearing conflicting reports about its functionality. <strong>FIXED!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>All this to say, I pushed myself more than any other Ludum Dare yet. My project scope was more than I could handle in the end, but I\u2019m still incredibly proud of the results. Thank you for checking out Blight Tower and being an integral part of the Ludum Dare experience :)</p>\n\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>ProCore</li><li>Blender</li><li>GIMP</li><li>VS Code</li><li>SFXR</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f818ec543e46a230ed1737c40c7831f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jeplmr"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
