Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.<br/><br/>This case is centered around an anesthesiologist, Peter Wentworth, who has an addiction to fentanyl.\u00a0 In this clinical simulation, you will make choices acting first in the role of an administrator (Parts I and II) and then, in the part of a clinician (Parts III).\u00a0This case will challenge you to recognize the circumstances in which a physician should be reported for drug-related impairment. It will reveal the process involved in recovery for an impaired physician including:</p>\n<p>~ Protections and privacy for physician patients treated for substance use<br/>~\u00a0Ways that a physician's recovery can be facilitated<br/>~\u00a0The unique personal circumstances and challenges when a physician is impaired, such as the effects on their reputation and potential continued cue exposure with a return to work<br/>~\u00a0The potential effect of an impaired physician on patients, colleagues, and the practice<br/>~\u00a0The approach and success rates of Healthy Physician Programs<br/><br/>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0<br/><br/>~ Review medical record<br/>~ Complete an evaluation and treatment plan<br/>~ Make a plan of care for your patient<br/><br/>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection.
