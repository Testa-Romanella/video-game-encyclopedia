Or you can call it Wrestling extreme moments maker. Please read this before buying this game!</p>\n<p>Ladders, Tables, Chairs, Flaming woods and... fans ba dum tss.</p>\n<p>This is a trailer:\u00a0https://youtu.be/Q8oMX4AwcNM im not professional, ok? this is ok for my level. mhm<br/></p>\n<p>alright, now read the instructions!</p>\n<p>You can find this instruction in my game as well ;)</p>\n<p>Hello and welcome! Thank you for downloading/buying this game! Hope you'll be satisfied. Here you can read about controls and some information.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to my YouTube channel to stay tuned (I'm planning to update this game).</p>\n<p>In \"Play\":<br/>To score, you should press the Space button when the pointer is pointing to green zone. If you press when it's pointing to red then you will lose all your points and will start all over. After each score you earn coins. After every 10 scores, you will start getting more. More scores means, smaller green zone and faster cursor. Good luck with it!</p>\n<p>In \"Arena\":<br/>You can create some moments here. Especially extreme moments. I think that's why you are here. To move cursor press W,A,S,D buttons. You can move things with it (no grabbing). To move players press Up,Down,Left,Right arrows, but it's reversed, because it's actually moves the whole thing, except players. Note that, ok? To teleport things to the center of the world press Z button. Press Space to make them go full ragdoll. If you done moving things, press to one of those \"move\" buttons and enjoy what happens. But double check that your screen recorder is on! Then put it on your Youtube channel, then write to my email, and I'll definitely check that out! YO YO YO</p>\n<p>In \"Shop\":<br/>It's simple. Hope no bugs there. Just press \"buy\" if you want to buy something. You should have enough money. Item becomes expensive everytime you buy. You can't buy as many times you want, even if you billioner. There's a limit.</p>\n<p>In \"Help/about\":<br/>You can rea... wait, you already here and if you reading this, then it means that you read all of the things above, or just skipped. Anyway...</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!
