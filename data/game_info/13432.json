In this game you will go up against an unstoppable Baron and storm Castle Madness to save a village in dire need. As you progress, the levels grow to become labyrinthian, battles get bigger and even more exciting. The tension builds for what might be around the next corner...<br/><br/><br/>Featuring grid-based movement for exploration and old school level design which rewards those who want to find every secret hidden within the game, the Dungeons of Castle Madness provides a challenge for everyone. On 'hardcore' difficulty the automap is disabled altogether, forcing you to map out the levels on graph paper like in the old days - and the monsters are tougher. A unique system powers the game with a more realistic inventory than typically found in most RPG's (you won't be carrying everything and the kitchen sink around with you). Armour can be damaged and even destroyed in battle, but not to worry though, it can be repaired, upgraded, crafted from scratch and even conjured from thin air. With 19 levels to fight your way through - 2 of which are different on every play through - you'll be tested to the limit.<br/><br/><br/>You are not without your own considerbale powers in this quest against tyranny. You can tear foes limb from limb as a shapeshifting werewolf... Blast enemies with infernal magics as a powerful wizard... Craft magical items as a highly skilled blacksmith... Charge headlong into the fray as a warrior of the blade... Fry those foolish enough to oppose you with terrible lightning as a storm priest! Or why not mix these abilities up, and more, to play the character you want to play... your way. <br/><br/><br/>Gather treasures to you, gain long lost magics and become strong enough to face the Baron! Assemble the unique artifacts of legend from seperate pieces that lie scattered and hidden in dank and dusty chambers and unlock your destiny. Secrets abound for the curious hero - but be wary - for there are traps too... as the Baron of Castle Madness is a cruel and vicious man.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/9254fbd93d3c76f17e044cc4fef812c5.jpg", "website": "http://www.third-impression.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 39}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Third Impression"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Third Impression"], "esrb_rating": null}
