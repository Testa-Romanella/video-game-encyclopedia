The purpose behind this research was to revive a sorcerer that was said to be able to control minds. Taxes were raised for more beneficial purposes on the outside, but, on the inside, that money was funneled discreetly into the project.</p>\n<p>The project met with massive success. The sorcerer made it so that the people no longer knew who they were, or what was done to them. There were some stragglers that remained unaffected by the tragic affair, but had very little morale, much less other useful resources with which to fight against the sorcerer. If they had but a hero, symbol to rally their forces together, perhaps, they might just have a prayer.</p>\n<p>You are little more than a peasant wanderer. A vagrant that takes up whatever jobs that are needed. On one such job, you learn something that you should not have, and become a threat to the established order. Thus, you join the rebellion, and fight to stop the dark shadow that reaches across the lands with them. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:05:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7a66c036e024c1c6b58593680d0ac6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedWall10"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
