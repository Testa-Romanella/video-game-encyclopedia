So we came up with the idea to make a game about bulimia, hoping that through this game, we could educate more people about bulimia, understand their struggle with both body and mental state health.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49c45795da4ce338c623ce5ae1cc62d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Halfway Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
