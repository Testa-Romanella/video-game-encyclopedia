This is what makes the game tick, and I hope you enjoy the combination as much as I do.</p>\n<p>This demo features a TON of new content from the original prototype demo, including but definitely not limited to:</p>\n<ul><li>A\u00a0brand new on-rails system, taking the player through a mountainside landscape</li><li>Music!!! (Thanks, in most part, to\u00a0this CC0 score of\u00a0Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #2 and the wonderful\u00a0Bosca Ceoil)</li><li>A proper title screen, congrats screen, and intro cutscene</li><li>New models replacing the old CSG shapes</li><li>New enemy formations and enemy types</li><li>New scoring system\u00a0(will likely be changed in the final version)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Controller support is enabled, so feel free to use one.</p>\n<ul><li>Z / Button 0: Fire (hold down)</li><li>X /\u00a0Button 1: Bomb (use when \"BOMB OK!\" or \"SUPERCHARGE!\" is shown)</li><li>C /\u00a0R1 or R2: Brake (slows movement while held)\u00a0</li><li>Delete: Pause game</li><li>Escape: Quit (not allowed in some menus)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>Every enemy you kill and bullet you graze\u00a0increases the score multiplier.\u00a0 Dying or letting the multiplier gauge reach empty will result in the multiplier being reset.</p>\n<p>Extra lives (aka extends) granted\u00a0at 100k / 250k, therefore, scoring is important for surviving.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>While you can't shoot down the swords, you can use their bullets to continue your chain to the ships in the first part of the level, and (hypothetically) the robot in the second part of the level.<ul><li>The ships are worth a lot of points, so try to build up a multiplier by destroying\u00a0weak enemies\u00a0before you shoot them down.</li></ul></li><li>The crest on your cloak is roughly where your hitbox is\u00a0(it's quite small)</li></ul>\n<p>I didn't have enough time to get a nice scoring run in myself, but I'd be honored if you shared your best score down below in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:12:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53b62c8aef284c15b900480cf6d9173e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tis2k"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
