Spate is a dark, brooding, and beautifully crafted emotional journey that is seen through the eyes of a struggling addict.  Created by former Disney &amp; Jim Henson artist Eric Provan, this artistic game is a story about one man's struggle and descent into madness. Fueled by absinthe hallucinations and haunting memories, Spate delivers a deliciously eerie adventure as the main character deals with the tragic loss and grim reality of the death of his daughter.", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2014-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-18T08:35:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65f5feb889d1d470d9b1640d1e82f47.jpg", "website": "http://www.spategame.com", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 233, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eric Provan - Ayyo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ayyo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
