{"id": 646069, "slug": "big-mystery", "name": "Big Mystery", "name_original": "Big Mystery", "description": "<p><strong>A mystery solving walking simulator with horror elements set in a forest where it's always raining.\u00a0Your only tool is a flashlight, and your only clue to start with\u00a0is that there is a mystery.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>During the day the forest is lush and\u00a0full of bird songs, but as the night comes down the forest changes and your only defence is your trusty flashlight. Keep it charged and it will keep you alive.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So come on, grab your legs and get ready. You've got a big and very important\u00a0mystery to solve.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>*GAMEPLAY LENGTH*</strong></p>\n<p>Full disclosure -\u00a0The <em>story</em> in this game is very\u00a0short (like 15 minutes) if you know what you're doing.\u00a0The actual\u00a0length of gameplay comes from walking around and\u00a0discovering the mystery and then working out the clues. If you enjoy immersive experiences where you can walk around and listen to rain, and birds then this might be fun for you. Otherwise you may want to skip this one. There is no saving or loading.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>*CONTROLS*</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Walking: WASD</li><li>Toggle Flashlight: F</li><li>Charge Flashlight: Hold C</li><li>Run: Hold Shift</li><li>Interact: Left Click</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>*DEVELOPMENT INFO*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sometimes I want to make a new system but I don't want to add it to my existing project, so I turn it into its own game. This game started as a custom solution to translate in-game strings to other languages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</strong><strong>*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game will play best on mid to high-end PCs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*LANGUAGES*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The text within this game can be translated to the below languages using the dropdown on the main menu.</p>\n<ul><li>English</li><li>German</li><li>French</li><li>Italian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Russian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Simplified Chinese</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note: Horror games aren't really my thing, so for those of you who are into them this probably isn't that scary. But my 13yr old nephew played it and said it was scary... So there's that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:35:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc0cc9808007ee1e36a549d4f95c2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atorcoppe Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
