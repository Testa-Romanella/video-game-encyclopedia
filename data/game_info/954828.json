Fearing he may have had an accident you venture inside the mines, only to suffer a fall of your own.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As you look up at daylight far above the now broken ladder, you realize there is nowhere to go but deeper underground.\r\n</p>\n<p>A classic dungeon-crawler style game with a vertical dimension and exploration on both solid ground and underwater.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam Theme</strong></p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the duality theme was above water vs below water and the interaction between them. The movement, enemies, AI, lighting, sound and effects were very different between the two elements. Underwater requires oxygen tanks to breathe, and masks to see clearly, whereas on dry land you can breathe but you can't go vertically up and down without ladders. Plus, we have a coin you can toss, although we did incorporate a third possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD to move and QE to rotate\u00a0horizontally (or the arrow keys)\u00a0and\u00a0PgUp /PgDn to move vertically (or the mouse wheel). Free look using the RMB which also facilitates moving up and down when combined with the direction keys.\u00a0Access the inventory using 'I'.</p>\n<p>Using crowbars, weapons and other activatable items: Drag the selected item to one of the four available quick-slots using the Left Mouse Button. Click and Hold the Right Mouse Button. Release the button as the indicator on the bar\u00a0below progresses from left to right to avoid misses and achieve critical hits.<br/></p>\n<p>Items can be selected using Left Mouse and moved directly to the inventory by clicking on the Tab above the Quick-Slot Combat UI.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some items can be stacked in the inventory by placing them onto the same slot. Shift + Left Mouse Click to separate out stacked items.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/9501dd554b5c27c34ba780f9b1f50a6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rebello"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
