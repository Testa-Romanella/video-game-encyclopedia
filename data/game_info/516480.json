Easy right?\u00a0WRONG! There's traps everywhere and on top of that there's water everywhere. You have to pull a lever to make the water dissapear, while the lever is pulled you can't move and you have to remember the safe path! After the time is up the lever goes back to its origin position and the water in the dungeon fills up again. Now you have to walk the path you hopefully memorized. Quick! Someone is waiting for their Pizza and if you want a good tip you gotta hurry and deliver it before it gets cold!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/614/614ca05ab2d4ed950226e624cfb6d1a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iiirmchen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
