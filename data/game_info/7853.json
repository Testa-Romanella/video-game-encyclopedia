The game is for 2-4 players (human or AI) with each player in control of a group of 10 frogs, which connect to the other player\u2019s frogs to form an island. <br/><br/>The shape and size of the island is constantly changing as players add and jump their frogs about in an attempt to rally them into one large group to win the game.
