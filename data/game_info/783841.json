You have to solve various challenges by wiring an autonomous robot: ALAN-13. While doing so, you gradually learn how to think like a programmer (without writing any code) and get familiar with some of the fundamental tools of programming. You can view it as step 0 to become a software developer, if you are interested in that sort of things. If not, just enjoy the ride!<h3>Your task:</h3><br/>In 2177 (30 years after the initial launch of the first units) the terraformation of planet Venus was right on track. Then, for yet undiscovered reasons the sun started expressing unusual behavior with regular solar flares and massive CMEs on a scale we never experienced before. These effects essentially destroyed our electrical infrastructure on the surface, and the lingering disturbance in the electromagnetic field makes regular means of communication unreliable. To conquer these challenges and to restore the infrastructure, our mechanical engineers updated our general purpose robot (ALAN series) with heavy shielding and additional hardware that we may require.<br/><br/>Your task (as our only engineer on location with background in automation) is to make these units fully autonomous and self-sustaining because remote communication is not guaranteed at any point. For this task, you can build the microcontroller for ALAN-13 by using our tried and tested GENESIS\u2122 components. Furthermore, you have to equip the robot with the right set of peripherals for any given mission.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/2277c5219f33769bdbec6559357cb27d.jpg", "website": "https://www.smithandcherryapps.com/alan13", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Viktor Kov\u00e1cs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["smithandcherryapps"], "esrb_rating": null}
