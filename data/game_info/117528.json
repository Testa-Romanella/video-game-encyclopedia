And you can dash to your aiming cursor to move faster or to try a melee attack\r\nYou can tweak a lot of things such as : AI level, starting lives, game mode (beta).\r\nps : qwerty, azerty keyboard and controller are supported (controller still recommended).\r\nWhile playing the first time you'll experience how special the shooting and dashing system is. This is a true gameplay choice which, as for us, turn \"Sad Robo\" into an original and demanding 2d shooter despite its minimalist level design.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 : THE DEVS\r\nVisuals and PixelArt : Anicet.N\r\nmusic https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1ZkP03V18LmOj8zbyP-Dw<br/>\r\nby Evan King\r\nCoding : Anicet.N \r\ntype of code used : css/html/js x phaser.js\r\ncontact me : an.nougaret@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThis game is open source and we are curious to know what you do with our game !\r\nDon't be afraid to share things related to the game in the comments :)\r\nDon't forget, this game is not a finished product, adjustments are planned !\r\n\r\n\r\nI managed to put it on itch.io thanks to Julian !\u00a0 \r\n<p>You can visite his website he made a nice pokemon like game : http://opmon-game.ga/<br/></p>\r\nRoadmap : \r\n<p>Add collectables, more levels, more weapons or characters and maybe a story mode in a long time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afd/afd717ae89a76d73be0f1d6342ede57a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anicet Ngrt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
