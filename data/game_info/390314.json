It was conceived, hosted, and formatted by Sarah Rowan, @EchoingLaughter.\u00a0Each card is credited on the bottom to its creator. Every card contains only the text that can fit within a single tweet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is marked \"in development\" due to its nature as a community project. New cards may be submitted at any time by notifying @EchoingLaughter and joining the thread. The game will update as new cards are added.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Liminal Labyrinth is a game about escaping the odd space between spaces in which you find yourself. </strong>It is competitive for 2-5 players. There are two files, identical save inverted coloration for ink preservation or aesthetic, whichever you may prefer. I recommend printing single-sided and inserting into card sleeves after cutting. Besides these cards, you will need only a single coin.</p>\n<p>Good luck.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits, alphabetical:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>@BlazamoIntoWowee</li><li>@curubethion</li><li>@DorkNightShow</li><li>@earthtonickb</li><li>@EchoingLaughter</li><li>@Glistam</li><li>@greuh</li><li>@junkfood_games</li><li>@narshero</li><li>@SandroFreed</li><li>@WuDeRpg</li></ul>\n<p>(Cover image sourced from game-icons.net)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/1808367e99010455ea4800e3c03dfa08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarah \"Bog Witch\" Rowan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
