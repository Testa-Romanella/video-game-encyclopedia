I've spent roughly four weeks on this. It has some pretty big design issues but I like it as it is :)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE GAME:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is a quick and short 2d retro shmup game I coded on Gamemaker 2. Control scheme is simple: use the mouse to move the ship, spam the left click button to shoot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Opengameart ressources:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Audio: </strong>Retro Game Music Pack, by Juhani Junkala (https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action).
