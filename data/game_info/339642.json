It can move really fast. It can pass through solid matter.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Why am I\u00a0a sphere? Why is the sky so bleak? Where is everybody?\u00a0 These are questions only you can answer after playing interest.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>This is the first interactive experience I made as I\u00a0learned C#. As such there aren't any extrinsic expectations or goals for\u00a0the player. I was inspired by the\u00a0art of Dima Goryainov's entry for My Famicase Exhitbition 2017\u00a0and the bleak feeling it gave me as I\u00a0observed the cartridge art. I hope you enjoy it.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The sphere will bug out a bit if you look directly up or directly down. If that happens, don't panic. Just slowly adjust the camera in the opposite direction\u00a0and it'll re-adjust.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T04:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/039d3aabd37b26f7515eaa4c068fbda4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["hoopsDoggit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
