{"id": 145666, "slug": "happy-island", "name": "Happy Island", "name_original": "Happy Island", "description": "On an island in the middle of the ocean, you've discovered a great totem! A statue of a goat on a pole stands from a rock. You feel like the statue is trying to tell you something -- telling you to bring others to it so they too can bask in the glory of goat-on-a-poledness.\r\nSearch the island for other people, and lead them to the goat on a pole. Then perhaps the glory of the statue will bring you enlightenment! Or something.\r\n<p>Happy Island was a game made in about 60 hours for TOJam 8 all the way back in 2013. It's very simple -- find people on the island and lead them to the goat on a pole. This is a slightly updated version using MonoGame instead of classic XNA to run.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Happy Island supports Xbox 360 gamepad or keyboard input (but only one or the\u00a0other; not both at the same time). If you have a gamepad plugged in, it will default to that; otherwise use the keyboard to play. You'll require a keyboard with a number pad.</p>\n<p>You'll start by the statue of the goat on a pole. Walk around the island, talk\u00a0to the people you find, and get them to follow you to the goat on a pole. Once\u00a0everyone has been lead to the statue, you've won the game! Be careful, though.\u00a0Not everyone is as quick as you, and if you get too far ahead, they'll wander\u00a0back to what they were doing before.</p>\r\nControls\r\nActionGame PadKeyboardMove aroundLeft StickNumpad buttons<br/>Talk to personA ButtonZ key<br/>Let person goB ButtonX key<br/>PauseStart/BackEsc key", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93dcbd72bded4aa39ada8191baf73981.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coldacid", "zahlman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
