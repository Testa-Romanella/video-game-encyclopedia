Thus, the \u201cincident\u201d begins: Fairies fighting over fruit soon found themselves hand in hand singing together as if nothing had ever happened, humans and youkai were gathering together for elegant tea parties, and \u201cenemies\u201d and \u201crivals\u201d were turning into \u201cfriends\u201d... perhaps something more intimate, too?</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>\u201cEven if this \u2018love\u2019 is beautiful, it is one that is artificial.

This jam version contains:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>+ A function that lets you set your starting lives! Five is traditional and the default... but how does up to <strong>999 </strong>lives sound to you? (You can also set it to 0,\u00a0 but why though?)<br/>+ Two\u00a0difficulties. Would you like a relaxing journey or a fierce challenge?<br/>+ Two player duos: two charming religious ladies and two handsome men(!?) who have decided to dabble in incident-solving, all with their unique shot-types and spellcards.<br/>+ Danmaku patterns with <strong>LGBTQ+-themed color palettes.</strong><br/>+ An intense 5-stage boss fight!<br/>+ A very short stage section meant to prep you up for the above! (No music for this one, unfortunately.)<br/>+ A simple scoring system. Speedkill and pointblank enemies for the fabled BIG NUMBER!<br/>+ An intense and exciting boss theme arranged from Unconnected Marketeers.<br/>+ Replay functionality (for real this time)!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Future post-jam updates will add the following new content to enjoy:</strong></p>\n<p>+ More tracks (stage theme and title theme), as well as revisions to the boss theme!<br/>+ A longer stage and boss fight! <br/>+ Addition of missing assets and polishing of finished ones.<br/>+ Overall more lore and story.<br/>+ And perhaps other secrets!?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS WITH THE JAM VERSION:</strong><br/><br/>+\u00a0<strong>Game-crashing:</strong> Attempting to restart the game via the \"Re-enter the Parade\" option (after clearing or getting a game over) will crash the game.
