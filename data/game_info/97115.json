If you love games like Soldat, Teeworlds and N++, watch the gameplay trailer and give Ninslash a shot.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNinslash is a multiplayer PvP and PvE platformer. It's fast and unforgiving, so \r\n\t<strong>prepare to die</strong>. Embrace it, enjoy it, and try avoiding it with mouse and keyboard.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can change the gamemode and server settings in-game, by 'Call Vote' menu. Local server can be started by running ninslash_srv.exe.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b59/b599f015c08545e5735e0a89b908a844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Siile"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
