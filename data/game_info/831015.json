You are alive and present in this little world, and you have no obligations. Simply explore wherever, whoever, whatever you find interesting.</p>\n\n<p>A short open-world game made in Bitsy. This is my first project-- please share any critiques you have! I may or may not attempt to expand the game later on.</p>\n\n<p>A cheat sheet is attached, intended for those who are A) stuck, or B) already done with the game and just want some behind-the-scenes info.
