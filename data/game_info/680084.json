Here's a chance to test that luck, without losing your shirt in the process.  Lotto Life is an authentic lottery simulator similar to state-run lotteries. <br/><br/>Welcome to Ys, a modern city under the auspices of Lotto Life Megacorporation.  Every day, in real time, a winning number is drawn for the in-game lottery.  Buy tickets, read the daily newspaper, go to work, and maybe win big!  Fail to pay the rent, though, and you're looking at a new life (or perma-death, if you like) in debtor's prison.<br/><br/>In line with simulating the wait-and-see experience of playing the lottery, this game plays out at a slow pace. Most days your session can take around 5 minutes to complete, and then real time must pass before more can be done.<br/><br/>Please note that this is a game, with no actual real-life cash payout in the event of picking a winning ticket.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T02:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267db27135603cf44277b636da7dae21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ryan", "Stephen Rich", "Anthony Rietkerk", "Jiwon Suh", "Jason Maiser", "Pallav Sharda", "Nuvya Dutt Sharda"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Single Cell Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
