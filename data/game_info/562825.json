With the dust settled, the Hallowed would serve Alavon in peacetime by being its protector. Until the day they all went mad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aarlin Rein, a member of the Order, flees with his life. On a small boat with his friend Kara, the duo escape Alavon as convicts, hoping to start a new life. Yet the fleeting calm is shattered when their past comes to find them. A shadow is looming over the lands of Agrad, uninhibited and sprawling. Left unchecked, all will be consumed in darkness.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Amazing art from the talented Low and Ateliae.</li><li>Music by Schematist.</li><li>A cast of LGBTQIA+ characters.</li><li>A dark, story driven narrative with an emphasis on characters.</li><li>Through the alter system, each core ability in the game can be changed to suit different playstyles.

This is my first attempt to create an RPG, and I've been diligently plugging away at it since last year. As of now, you can play the\u00a0first 20-25% of the game that should take anywhere from 4-7 hours. It is a linear, story based RPG experience. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!</p>\n<p>Please save early and often. If you encounter any bug that prevents you from proceeding, save as best you can and leave me a comment. I will be taking a break from development for the next two weeks to recuperate, absorb feedback, and be available to fix any bugs that present themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The file size is quite large for an RPG Maker game, I'm aware. That's because <strong>I'm essentially finished with the game.</strong> The skeleton of it anyway. I need to polish, balance, test, and add things over the next few months.\u00a0 I didn't want to publish a demo until I was pretty much finished with the game, and I'm nearly there. :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Any donations will go straight to buying assets to make this game better.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Talented Artists!\u00a0</strong>Check out my commissions page. I'm looking for all the help I can get to polish this game up! I will be adding a few more items over the weekend. I\u00a0need help with custom:\u00a0Boss HP Bar, main menu background,\u00a0 static scene drawings, battle UI, and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/paid-art-mapping-mz-updated-2-1...<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>9/20/20 </strong>- Changed some screenshots, reduced project file size.<br/><strong>9/20/21 </strong>- Filled in the dialogue boxes more thoroughly, reduced wait time between most conversations.
