It only implements movement around a simple map (no level generation), and has various UI quirks. There is no lighting, and all textures are debug textures.<br/><p>Vel0city is a high-speed platformer with Quake-like movement mechanics- and without enemies. Race through an infinite randomly-generated level, gaining speed by airstrafing and bunnyhopping, but watch out! One wrong move and it's all over. And don't think of trying to take it slow- you'll need a lot of momentum to take difficult jumps.</p><p>Features planned:</p><p>Replay system</p><p>Cheat-resistant online scoreboard, with the ability to watch replays of any play</p><p>Ability to export RNG seeds, and play with a given seed; try to beat somebody else's run on the same map as them!</p><p>Custom engine, programmed from the bottom up for low latency and responsive player movement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a38b729a66fca00226d5c0f79ebc0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xmppwocky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
