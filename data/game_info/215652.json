Genre without mechanic, Survival without resources to gather or things to build.</p>\n<p>***** Updated ***** (Can't update it, expect the update after the GameJam finishes)<br/>- Now there's a \"win condition\".<br/>- Bigger UI.<br/>- Added a Hungry bar.</p>\n<p>This project has been put on hold for now. The development will continue\u00a0 around mid Novemeber, expect some major updates, here's a glimpse of things that will come to this game:<br/><br/>- A city, you'll be able to go out, forget about that hiddeous appartment.<br/>- Minigames: if you check the game console it tells you that it is the only real game mechanic, it was originally intended to have mini-games in the same theme of the game jam, like a Bullet Hell where you can't shoot (someone did that in the Jam, go check his game out) but I run out of time,\u00a0expect some of those ideas.<br/>- A full-fledged story.<br/>- Well thought comedy instead of fourth wall breaking stuff.<br/>- And more...!
