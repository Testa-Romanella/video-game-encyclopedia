{"id": 904296, "slug": "the-chronicles-of-arden", "name": "The Chronicles of Arden", "name_original": "The Chronicles of Arden", "description": "<p>The Chronicles of Arden\" is an RPG made with RPG Maker MV that follows the adventures of a young protagonist named Casey. In this thrilling tale, Casey plays a vital role in fulfilling an ancient prophecy that will determine the fate of their world. A great ancient evil is approaching, and only Casey has the strength and courage to stand against it.</p>\n<p>Despite using mostly basic assets and some assets from Dragonbones, \"The Chronicles of Arden\" manages to create a somewhat, immersive world that players will get lost in.</p>\n<p>This is my first game made with RPG Maker MV, and my first game in general. I was inspired to create it because I have always been a huge fan of\u00a0 games, and I wanted to create a world and story that others could enjoy as much as I do.</p>\n<p>Please note that \"The Chronicles of Arden\" is a short game, as it is my first time making a game and I simply wanted to have fun creating it. However, I am always looking for ways to improve and expand upon it, and any feedback from players is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding and I hope you enjoy your time in the world of Arden!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T04:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a5685eccaf006407a57c90056b6a85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigCangus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
