Now under the name SRPG Gear, we present the tactical battle system for the RPG Maker MZ version.</p>\n<p>In addition to enhancements to existing features, SRPG Gear MZ also includes a number of extension plugins by contributors. This Demo version serves as a guide to how a feature can be done with the available plugins. You can download and open it with the RPG Maker MZ editor and see for yourself how the features are created.</p>\n<p>Of course, besides serving as a guide, this Demo is a full game that you can enjoy the storyline from start to finish. Please try to finish the game.</p>\n<p>As a result of this change, some extensions that previously ran on RPG Maker MV are not all compatible with RPG Maker MZ, although we are trying to port some essential extensions. We apologize for this, but you can still use the RPG Maker MV version if you are comfortable on that system.</p>\n<p>The development of the Demo has been made possible by the contributions of many people who have taken the time to write extensions for the system, provide usage advice, and who provide help to fellow users through the RPG Maker Web forums. This project has also survived because of those of you who have made donations through itch.io. Your donations have truly made an impact on this project.</p>\n<p>Through this article, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Shoukang who has donated his time and ideas to provide significant development so that this system can become more complete thanks to its extensions. Not to forget DrQ who contributed to this project from the very beginning. Also to Dopan and Boomy who always provide endless help through their amazing extensions and support on the forum.</p>\n\n<p>You can continue to support this project in any form. If you understand javascript, please share your extensions to us. If you would like to donate, we will use your donation to add more features to SRPG Gear.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>SRPG Team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/049f72a1a4c9b8bf0fd76d9bfcfc15c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanBram"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
