Throughout the game, you must navigate using sounds to escape the forest.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p><strong>This game has:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0- Audio</p>\n<p>\u00a0- A monster that chases you</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Objectives</p>\n<p>\u00a0- And other stuff I guess</p>\n<p>Basically, I had an idea of an audio-only game, where you navigate using sound. The game currently has some lights, but it's mostly sound navigation.</p>\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n<p>This game was made in 1 day\u00a0for the SCREAM JAM 2022+1. The jam lasted a week but I had a school trip in the middle of it.\u00a0\u00a0I just cranked the game out in a day because I felt like it. That's pretty much it.</p>\n\r\nRequirements\r\n<p>Headphones are <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong>. You need to hear what direction sounds are coming from in order to navigate. That's pretty much it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T11:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/434751a414973391b35bbb54d7fe7a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zbomb2000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
