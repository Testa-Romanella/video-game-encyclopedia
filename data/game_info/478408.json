Your lightning strikes/storms cover a massive area across the procedurally generated planets, so the fast enemies should be manageable after you get used to the controls. The funkiest controls are:</p>\n<p>Space: blast off\u00a0in the direction the camera is facing.</p>\n<p>Character automatically tries to fly toward the camera direction. Arrow keys during flight to quickly roll/boost in that direction.</p>\n<p>LMB: throw lightning. RMB: summon a storm in front of you (only works when near clouds). There's a few hidden combat\u00a0mechanics aka rotate view while summoning the storm to cover a larger area, boosting during attack animations, etc.</p>\n<p>Update 1, 2, and 3: Decreased size from 1.2 GB\u00a0to 220 MB by deleting unused assets and reducing texture size (graphics change is negligible).\u00a0Fixed major bugs and lag. Runs on my 1080 Ti\u00a0at 80 FPS all day on Ultra.</p>\n<p>Update 4 (planned): Add credits.</p>\n<p>Credits (too many to list here so Google Docs link):\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCJ5IoFi0ke9vlMPhpWogsDpJUb9TFATq4C9TyiNFwk/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91ec20780cba4493b30cfd9b50c53b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yungshizzle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
