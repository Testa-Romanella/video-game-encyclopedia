And you also get to kill actual nazis. Nazis will hate this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a 1-level demo designed to give you a taste of what's to come with the actual game, in hopes you can grab it, spread the word and financially support the development of this game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Here be the controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Move\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Use (open doors etc)\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift - Dash\r\n</p>\n<p>Mousewheel - switch weapons\r\n</p>\n<p>You can wallrun too.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>STORY OVERVIEW:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The year is 2025. Johannland has overtaken nearly all of Western Europe under the Fourth Reich, and Johann Weiss, A.K.A Dark Weiss, rules Johannland with an iron fist on the fascist nation of Johannland, previously Germany and the rest of Europe. Thus the start of World War III, where the Johannland Axis faces the Allied forces in the looming threat of nuclear war.\r\n</p>\n<p>Word also has it that Johannland is using some occult, demonic powers to keep rising to power. Their soldiers are turned into some cosmic demons of sorts, who are savage, brutal, and even engage in cannibalism and other sorts of brutal crimes. Some say it has something to do with an Elder God known as Azathoth, whose whereabouts are unknown but somehow his shard has possessed Dark Weiss to wield incredible powers which led him to rule Johannland.\r\n</p>\n<p>SASS (Spies Against the Schutzstaffel)\u00a0has dispatched their best agents for the infiltration and attack on Johannland. Including you, Joan Marie, codename RED HYENA, a proficient spy and secret agent with expertise in armed and unarmed combat and infiltration into enemy territory. Your mission was to infiltrate and assassinate Dark Weiss before nuclear tensions from the Axis rise up.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, once you attempted to infiltrate Johannland\u2019s heart of the nation, into the Neo-Reichstag, you have been accidentally caught by the suspecting guards, and captured by the Axis into the prison of Castle Johannstein, where you\u2019ve been tortured and beaten\u00a0in hopes the Neue-Schutzstaffel of Johannland could extract any information from you, without any success.\r\n</p>\n<p>Luckily, your wits have led you to a plan for escape: you hide in the roof of your prison cell at Castle Johannstein when a guard checks inside. Once your prey has entered your cell, you quickly pounce on the guard and silently kill him with a kitchen knife you smuggled from your prison rations. You grab his pistol and set for escaping the castle, hoping you can continue with your mission in assassinating the F\u00fchrer of Johannland.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T14:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f5b118542e9018f869787bc862c5fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JMAA GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
