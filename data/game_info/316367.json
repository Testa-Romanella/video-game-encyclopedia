R - Ranged. C - Cleave.</p>\n<p>Depending on your choice of card you may be attacking or being attacked by the baddies. please refer to the icon in the top right of the enemy card to see its attack ranges.<br/></p>\n<p>When you select a card you will move to it, you will subtract your attack value from the power of the card, if you zero out the card then you will get the gold!<br/><br/>you will always attack before the enemy and certain enemies wont attack if you select them at all but you still need to kill them to get their gold!<br/><br/>at the end of every dungeon there is\u00a0 shop where you can spend gold to gain armor or weapon power! armor acts as a flat damage reduction. (1 armor = 1 less damage taken from attacks!)</p>\n\n<p>currently the goal is to just get as far as you can. I hope you like it!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/2085dbc7673143598cc6c12a77f8c45d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
