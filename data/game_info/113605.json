Control the greatest killer of slimes and battle your way through a near infinite amount of procedurally generated levels. Improve your character, acquire power-ups (soon), and avoid death at all costs!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEach session will accumulate a score, visible at the top of the screen. Use this score to compete against fellow Slimekillers. I have plans for a formal leaderboard.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEnjoy!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>UPDATES:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>4/29/2018 </em>- Changed music. Cleaned up main menu. New character sprite.
