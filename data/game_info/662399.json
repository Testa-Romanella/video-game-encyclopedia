{"id": 662399, "slug": "bubble-breaking", "name": "Bubble Breaking", "name_original": "Bubble Breaking", "description": "Bubble Breaking is an action arcade game.  Players can use mouse or gamepad to pop bubbles.  The bubbles come in different sizes (depths) and they rise at different speeds.  When bubbles are popped points are scored.  The smaller, faster bubbles score more points than the bigger, slower bubbles.  There is also an accuracy multiplier.  Each successive popped bubble increases the multiplier to a max of 10x the base point value.  If the player misses a bubble, whether by mouse or keyboard, the multiplier is resets back to 1x.  Beware of the 'stink' bubbles!  If you accidently pop one of them your score will be dragged down with the fishes. <br/>\r\nWhen 'Play' is selected players have 60 seconds to see how many points they can accumulate.  High scores are saved.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T03:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb8de9dc6f9a5f5a0d98f95887b4c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerald W Lynch"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GJ Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
