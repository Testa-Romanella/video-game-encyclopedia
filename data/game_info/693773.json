We are a very small - but dedicated! - team and we've been working on it for a couple months now. Although the game is in the alpha stage, we already like where it is going! Having said that, we would really appreciate any feedback you can give us. We want to know what you love, what you hate, what you'd like to see in the future and - of course - what doesn't work :) Since the game is in its early development stage, we are aware it has plenty of bugs, but you should be able to, at the very least, run it. So let us know if you find any trouble while at it!\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for you collaboration and game on!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Please comment.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thx for participate.\r\n</p>\n<p>ZX Death Row Revolt is a strange proyect.\r\nIs an interactive music video and a experimental shooter proyect.\r\nDownload, like and comment.\r\nWe need your feedback.\r\nDOWNLOAD LINK\r\nhttps://jameschappfillmore.itch.io/zx-death-row-revolt-v009\r\nGame Design and Programmer\r\nJames Chapp Fillmore\r\nItch.io:\u00a0https://jameschappfillmore.itch.io/\r\nYoutube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgr3UM5PJtxBnE99TOq5PA\r\nInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/james_chapp_fillmore/\r\nInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/4lg1z/\r\nReddit:\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/user/James_Chapp_Fillmore\r\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/ChappJames\r\nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011402026398\r\nPatreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/jameschappfillmore\r\nKo-fi:\u00a0https://ko-fi.com/jameschappfillmore\r\nBuymeacoffe:\u00a0https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jameschapp\r\nMusic by\r\nSantiago Iurissevich\r\nwww.soundcloud.com/yateoi\r\nINSTAGRAM:\u00a0@yateoi\r\nYOUTUBE:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83s4F__sIOYJsXrgxBW1pA\r\nCredits Music\r\nBassoid\r\nNew music\r\nMirta Kinex\r\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/mirtakinex/\r\nSound Engineer\r\nMatias Massari\r\nUNITY Prototype Programmer\r\nSof\u00eda Bombelli\r\nDevelopment Consultant\r\nSebasti\u00e1n Gioseffi\r\nCharacter Design\r\nJames Chapp Fillmore\r\nSantiago Iurissevich\r\n#gamedev\u00a0#indiedev\u00a0#indiegame\u00a0#indiegamedev\u00a0#indieworldorder\u00a0#indiedevhour\u00a0#gamedevelopment\u00a0#gaming\r\n#games\u00a0#gameidea\u00a0#earlyaccess\u00a0#gamemaker\u00a0#madewithgamemaker\u00a0#gamemakerstudio2\u00a0#gamedesign\r\n#coding\u00a0#programing\u00a0#bug\u00a0#pixelart\u00a0#pixeldrawing\u00a0#pixel3\u00a0#yellow\u00a0#characterdesign\u00a0#characterillustration\r\n#characterart\u00a0#pixeldesign\u00a0#draw\u00a0#drawing\u00a0#pixels\u00a0#pixelperfect\r\n</p>\n<p>New graphics by\r\n</p>\n<p>Robo Tileset\r\nArtwork created by 0x72\r\nhttps://0x72.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Monocrome caves\r\nArtwork created by Adam Saltsman\r\nhttps://adamatomic.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Bulkhead-walls\r\nGrunge-tileset-files\r\nIndustrial Parallax Background\r\nArtwork created by Luis Zuno (@ansimuz)\r\nWarped-city\r\nhttps://ansimuz.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Vacaroxa--generic-run-n-gun-pack--v.1.0\r\nThis assets was crafted by @Anokolisa and @al_MSantos, and published by Vaca Roxa.\r\nhttps://bakudas.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Mechanical tileset 32x32\r\nArtwork created by gtibo\r\nhttps://gtibo.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Basic 32x32 sci-fi tiles for roguelike\r\nArtwork created by Redshrike\r\nhttps://opengameart.org/users/redshrike\r\n</p>\n<p>for bugs and feedback comment or send a e-mail to;\r\n</p>\n<p>jameschappfillmore@gmail.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:42:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86a/86a783a5a3a3e93f1b5c8ccf0354aaa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamesChappFillmore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
