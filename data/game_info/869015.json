Curveball is basically just \"First Person\" pong.</p>\n<p>The original game was made in Flash, by\u00a0Joshua Skeels and published by\u00a0Paragon Digital Media around 2002. This is a \"fan remake\" and has no official connection to the original.</p><p>Obviously the original game is limited by Flash, and runs at a maximum of 30 FPS. So I wanted to unlock that, include many new features (and eventually game modes), but keep the core feel of the game identical. Which means it is entirely 2d, and uses the same math/functions as the original, just with frame independency. And yes, the last stage (should) still be technically impossible to beat.</p><p>The exception to keeping it \"close to the original\" is an entirely new scoring system. Not much to say there, just thought it'd be better with a new system.</p>\n<p>Frame Time Debugger Toggle : Backquote / Tilde\u00a0(~) Key</p>\n<p>I plan on further developing this with more game modes &amp; multiplayer, but you'll have to sit tight for now.</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: https://chrislsound.itch.io/ambient-puzzle</p>\n<p>Save Data : [location]/ECS-Curveball_Data/saves</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T12:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819f6fb1f2c358d9d4197020c2147341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RAB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
