We spent hours trying to nail down what we thought was the perfect idea. There were, of course, a lot of goofy options: visual story adventures without the visuals and a\u00a0logger simulator but there are no trees. After many ideas we came up with our little Robo-Boy! He\u2019s in a stealth game but he can\u2019t be stealthy.<br/><br/>Now, join Robo-Boy on his quest to solve some puzzles and avoid his enemies. Be smart and be stealthy (except you can\u2019t really be stealthy, whoops!).<br/><br/>This is our first game jam and we hope you enjoy the first game we\u2019ve ever finished!</p>\n<p>Controls;<br/>Navigate menus using your mouse and left click<br/>Pause: Escape or Start<br/>Movement: WASD or Left Stick<br/>Sprint: Left Shift or A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1d/b1dec64002fb9516671cbcd1978099fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heck134"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
