Yeah, we kinda messed up :/</p>\n<p>The boss had different phases, all the bullets shot at the boss were supposed to have a different effect and only appear when a certain item is triggered etc. Basically, the programming scope was to high for us (we're all in first year of Game Design or Animation studies).</p>\n<p>The actual finished prototype is getting finished and debugged so the only thing we have is a bunch of screen shots a preAlpha build ... sort of. But at least, pretty much all of the graphic elements are finished end look pretty good ^^</p>\n<p>Still, we had a blast making it and we hope you'll enjoy running around in the house ^^</p>\n<p>Team Members :</p>\n<p>Robert Biaulet (Concept, Character Design)<br/>Hugo Bochaton (Concept, Level Design)<br/>Laurie Daunay (Environment Design, Animation)<br/>Martin Fasquelle (Music)<br/>Alexis Prost (Animation)<br/>Eliot Ringeval (Concept, Level Design, Programming)<br/>Laure Vernier (Environment Design, Animation)<br/>Nathan Zwald (Concept, Level Design, Programming)</p>\n<p>(Special thanks to Sarrow, ur a good boi)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95ab082c4ef2fed5977dd78375b789d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatGreenGentleman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
