I took this to mean more of our place of existence, this being the universe. The ever expanding space that limits where we can go and what we can do, our World. I took this idea and brought it back to the theme, what if out world was smaller than we think? What if our infinite space of residence is nothing but a snow globe on somethings shelf?</p><p>How To Play:</p><p>Click on planets you have created to view their resources and statistics of the inhabitants.</p><p>You can take resources from the planets, but it will upset the inhabitants.</p><p>You can setup trade routs that allows planets to evenly split each others resources. This can let planets gain resources they otherwise wouldn't have access to.</p><p>That's about it, the info page has some info on the stats and resources, now go try and go and make your very own space empire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8d5ca2ac42fa8b5a289e40b7490b94f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LozzaDawg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
