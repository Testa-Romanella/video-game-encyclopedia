{"id": 50232, "slug": "rocket-blasters", "name": "Rocket Blasters", "name_original": "Rocket Blasters", "description": "Rocket Blasters is the end result of a small series of ball-point pen drawings I did in October of 2017.  The drawings were simple, space themed images, showing a small rocket ship, that developed into a kind of story over the month long period.  Someone suggested I animate the images, and I did one better and turned them into a game.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>There is nothing too deep going on here, but Rocket Blasters is fast paced, frustratingly addictive and fun.  Blow up asteroids, enemy spacecraft and occasional bosses in your very own super awesome rocket ship.  Get a variety of upgraded weapons in order to help blow up more asteroids, enemy spaceships ... you get the idea.<br/><br/>Each game asset is hand drawn with ball point pen on graph paper.  Some of the images are directly from the drawing series.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c8b8f57614140303f23cfa3c1378d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Klaus Schmidt"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Klaus Schmidt"], "esrb_rating": null}
