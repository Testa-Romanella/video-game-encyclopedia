(Android APK)", "description": "<p>Faint is a fun infinite runner about a drunk dude who took the phrase, \"Fuck the police!\" to heart. Play through a infinite game, where you collect bottles to earn upgrades! It's in fact, a very fun time, for the whole family. Get together and play together!</p>\n<p>All that aside. This is the child born from a legendary collaboration between:<br/>Pancakeey -\u00a0https://pancakeey.itch.io/<br/>tacecapS -\u00a0https://tacecaps.itch.io/<br/>slayervictor -\u00a0https://slayervictor.itch.io/</p>\n<p>This collab took place in a small house, where three drunken developers had a good time-- not like that! Faint is the product of that collab.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>We are trying to reach a Donation Goal of 25$, because we want to be able to upload the game on Google Play Store. We have reached 0$ of 25$.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Take pride in playing this amazing game, also.. SHARE with your friends!<br/>Thanks for reading this mess of a description!
