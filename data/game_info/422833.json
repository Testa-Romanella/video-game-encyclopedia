Using only their fists, up to 4 players try to punch each other off the map in excitingly intense battles. But there\u2019s a twist: the characters have no legs! Instead, players use their fists to walk, jump, wall-jump, and punch their way across the map. The result is a highly immersive locomotion system that requires agility, timing and cardio! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can download Dingleberries Demo and try our locomotion system right now. I this singleplayer demo, the goal is the reach the end of the map as fast a possible. This demo is an alpha build of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe full game is planned to release in early 2021.
