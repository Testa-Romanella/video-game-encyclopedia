Destroy your enemies by placing them in hazardous positions. (like on the left or right sight of the tower - they'd get hit :) Enemies can be also forced to attack themselves.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Use [WASD] to shift the tile rows or columns. Press [SpaceBar] to wait.</p>\n<p>Learn additional skills through upgrades. Once you acquire them, switch modes by pressing [1], [2] or [3]</p>\n<p>(hint: Tile Rotate uses only [A] or [D] keys).<br/></p>\n<p>When you have more max AP available, you can stack it by waiting in a turn. It will be available next turn for a double move (or triple or more).<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T12:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/34535af5ec35465c4ef0d678d45ba0ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maciek.glowka"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
