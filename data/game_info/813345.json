You have a card in your hand and you can only place them on a particular spot near you on the field. Every card has its own attributes. You can apply an attribute to the spot. If you can move - you lose. If you have no HP - you lose. If you reach the end flag - you win.</p>\n<p>This is basically a naked concept of the game. So I need all feedback you can provide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So hope you'll like this small game!
