Needless to say, it's a <strong>feature</strong>.<br/>\n<strong>Secondly</strong>, it's all carefully hand-pixelated. I personally took care of each pixel rendered on the screen (satisfying all their needs and goals).<br/>\n<strong>Third</strong>, it's not your average pixelated adventure game. Its story, sounds and music are designed and engineered to make the game stand on its own.<br/>\n<strong>Fourth</strong>, this game actually enhances your mind abilities. Its meaning maybe is one of the deepest you'll ever find in any interactive experience you'll ever play.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNow, some info on the <strong>plot</strong>. Or maybe not.<br/>\r\n\tEven a tiny hint about the game's story will be a huge <strong>spoiler</strong> on its emotional impact.<br/>But I'll leave here some <strong>screenshots\u00a0</strong>to satisfy your curiosity.<br/><strong>Beware</strong>: the screenshots are purposely\u00a0not in\u00a0chronological order and they represent only a small bit of the game's events.<br/>Do you want to avoid any spoilers?<br/>Don't look at\u00a0them.
