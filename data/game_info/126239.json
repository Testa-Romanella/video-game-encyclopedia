Today digital media, online and virtual spaces provide new platforms of expression. Digital and domestic environments can also become places of refuge, where people enter alternative realities, unburdened by the constraints of everyday life.<br/></em><br/><em>At the same time, digital media opens up new ways to monitor and regulate public expression and digital surveillance threatens the privacy and shelter of the home. Is the safety of domestic spaces under threat? Do digital environments offer spaces of expression and protest that relate to the real world in meaningful ways? Or are they realms of resignation and retreat into domestic comfort and digital daydreams? <br/></em><br/><em>This show will explore domestic and digital spaces, and investigate how they serve both as sites of subversive thoughts and actions, and as realms of withdrawal and disengagement. The exhibition will bring together sculptural installations and digital art to create environments, which the audience can enter and engage with, both physically and digitally.</em><p><strong>Controls for xbox controller || Key board/mouse</strong></p><p>Move - left analogue stick || WASD/arrow keys </p><p>Fire - A button || Left mouse button</p><p>Retry - A button || Left mouse button </p><p>Quit - Esc</p><p>A controller is recommend.</p><p>Disclaimer - This game was originally designed to be played in context of the above mentioned exhibition and is impossible to win.
