The application will then assess your flight performance against more than 20 parameters. It also includes inflight public announcements in several languages. Add functionality and realism to this plane!<br/><br/>In order to connect the application to X-Plane, iGoConnect plug-in must be installed. Note: iGoConnect uses TCP connection between your iPad and the computer where X-Plane is installed. <br/>The plug-in can be downloaded from these locations: <br/>http://forums.x-pilot.com/topic/7432-igoconnect/<br/>http://www.igoapp.ca/page_igoconnect/igoconnect.html<br/><br/>WARNING: This application is developed for X-Plane flight simulation ONLY and must NOT be used for real flight planning, aviation or navigation purposes!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T03:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2411a29df940971bf0e4c5e4869897_Wp61UJa.jpg", "website": "http://igoapp.ca/page_igodispatchsaab/igodispatchsaab.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Igor Tupitsyn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Igor Tupitsyn"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
