Despite the fact that the first game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown was a strategic game, this time is it a tactical third-person shooter. The story follows CIA Agent William Carter, who survives the attack of aliens in 1962 and becomes a member of the Bureau -  secret U.S. organisation that was created to fight with threats of national security scale. However, after arriving in the bunker, Faulke - director of the facility - states that all of the U.S. military bases have been destroyed and they cannot contact the White House. With that being said, the Bureau is now re-named into XCOM and starts its story from this moment.</p>\n<p>Despite genre difference to its predecessor, The Bureau still focuses on tactical elements of the gameplay. Agent Williams has a squad of 3 members with him included. While in the fight, the player can stop the game to give orders to his crew - change your position, use some skill or focus on the exact target.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2013-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-06T19:38:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5cc/5cc765484c6df567ed9207c1781b88cb.jpg", "website": "http://thebureau-game.com", "rating": 3.04, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 439, "owned": 5368, "beaten": 271, "toplay": 61, "dropped": 291, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 69, "ratings_count": 645, "suggestions_count": 514, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 646, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "macOS"], "developers": ["2K", "2K Marin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
