Through this demo you will be able to explore a dungeon, fight evil foes and find treasures.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by games like classic Zelda, Legacy of Kain and Demon's Souls.</p>\n<p>This is a student project developed by 3 Artists, 3 Animators, 2 programmers and 1 designer in 6 months.\u00a0As soon as the university assignment\u00a0ended it wasn't developed further.</p>\n<p>In RAD you are some kind of agent who entered in a virtually recreated medieval dungeon. This dungeon is under the attack of a virus and your objective is to eliminate its host.</p>\n<p>There is a control layout in-game, you can turn it off and change it in case you are using KB+M or controller. You can also use the numbers 1,2,3 or the D-pad direction buttons to give orders to your drone companion.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e33e8c3140ce9faaaf546475e90c42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wabbaboy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
