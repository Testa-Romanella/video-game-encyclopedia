In this game, you'll have the freedom to buy ships and upgrade them independently, customize your weapons, mine asteroids, search for artifacts, and sell items. You can even relax and read books in your own ship, or do anything else you want.</p>\n\n<p>There are five classes of ships available, ranging from agile Fighters to massive Dreadnaughts. Each ship class has unique attributes and can be outfitted with a variety of upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>As you explore the vastness of space, you'll encounter enemy space stations that you can attack and attempt to destroy for great rewards. This adds a roguelike feel to the game and provides a challenge for players who enjoy combat gameplay.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, you'll also encounter occasional events in space, such as high value targets and epic battles, which will keep you on your toes.</p>\n\n<p>You'll have plenty to explore with three expansive systems to discover, which will take a lot of time to fully explore. Along the way, you can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs) and observe their daily lives, or even change their fate. The choice is yours.</p>\n\n<p>We are committed to regularly updating and improving the game, so you'll never run out of new things to do. Dive into the vast universe of our space game and enjoy the journey!</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Pixel Planet Generator by Deep_Fold</p>\n<p>Sounds from freesound.org</p>\n<p>Space images by NASA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T09:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/2319c508504c7d748bb212a3e9fd205d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["GoldSpark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
