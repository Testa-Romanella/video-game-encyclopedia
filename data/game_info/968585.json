Players will be faced with heavy choices with the freedom of taking the wrong path often. The send category of secondary characters are the 'Villagers', characters that seem to spring from kids' TV programmes and books. At first they seem simple and innocent, but they have their on singular purpose to 'help' Rufus learn the lessons he needs to change his outlook.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe leading secondary character is a seemingly omniscient narrator, who prods Rufus through the game, but as the game progresses, the player will begin to question if the narrator is all they seem to be.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRufus must explore the many locations in sleepytime village, finding objects that don't belong there which when collected transport him back to the 'real world' in the form of a flashback so he can get some insight into his past and recent present.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game will track the choices the player makes and provide multiple paths depending on if the lessons the village is trying to teach are being taken on board.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAppropriately, the game is a family affair. The characters are all based on drawings by writer / composer Steven Horry\u2019s daughter, created between the ages of 3 and 5 and interpreted by Ukrainian artist Yulia Lapko. We figured the best way to create children\u2019s storybook characters that would appeal to kids but freak out adults was to actually work with a child - have you ever watched the Bedtime Hour on CBeebies? Trust us, it\u2019s trippy and it\u2019s terrifying. Don\u2019t Google Collywobble. It has been a source of joy and encouragement to see her drawings turned first into art by Yulia, and then bought to animated life by Creative Director/Developer James Lightfoot.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDare you enter the village?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T04:12:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85c/85c17914d4421e90aa9f4b8d3510f433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lightfoot Bros Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Lightfoot Bros Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
