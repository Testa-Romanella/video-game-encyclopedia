Navigate the sandbox environment and build yourself into the Ocnus you need to be. Pick up blocks, fruit, fish, and anything else that will stick to your core to match the needs of your climb. <br/><br/>Stuck trying to climb a particularly thin cliff? Perhaps a change in shape is in order. Rearrange yourself and try again! Just be careful where you fling those blocks. It would be a shame if they were lost to the sea far below.<br/><br/>Though the climb ahead may be daunting, with a little creativity and patience no task is impossible.<br/><br/><h3>-- Gameplay Features --</h3><ul><li>Physics-based platforming that relies on careful movement to avoid disaster. Every second counts, as an accidental fall can occur at any moment.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Change</strong> your physics, size, and shape by picking up and dropping blocks and other objects such as fish, pumpkins, candles, and more.</li></ul><ul><li>Explore a complex environment split into <strong>many diverse regions</strong>, each with their own themes and challenges.</li></ul><ul><li>Tackle your problems with a sandbox approach, where no challenge has a single solution. <strong>Experiment and break things!</strong></li></ul><ul><li>A challenging but fair checkpoint system, to ease with the difficult climb.</li></ul><ul><li>For those that want an even greater challenge, <strong>harder difficulties</strong> limit the number of blocks and checkpoints available in the world. There's even a <strong>no-checkpoint Legendary Mode</strong> for those that really want to suffer.</li></ul><ul><li>Customize your look with <strong>unlockable colors and hats</strong>. Low in practicality but high in fun.</li></ul><ul><li>A challenge mode with <strong>unlockable micro challenges</strong> that can be completed outside of the main game.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Fishing!</strong> If by fishing you mean ramming into fish and sticking them to yourself. Don't worry, they love it. Probably.</li></ul><ul><li>A darker world than appearances may suggest. Climbing to the peak may reveal truths that some would wish remained secret. Just who or what are Ocnus anyway?</li></ul><h3>-- Your Ascension Awaits --</h3>Amidst a mountain of corpses you climb, higher than any others of your species. For what is an Ocnus without an endless and futile struggle? Reach the peak and ascend to your full potential...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-09T02:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5bdf2aa5acfcf6d0a11185d03a56228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gawkfish Studios", "Alex Gimson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex Gimson"], "esrb_rating": null}
