Blocking your way will be many breakable colored bricks. In addition, some areas are locked behind<br/>colored gates. <strong>Press SHIFT to fire your bouncing Squareball to break bricks </strong>of various colors; you can only <strong>destroy gates of the corresponding<br/>color if your Squareball has picked up that color</strong> from the last brick<br/>it broke.</p><p>The Squareball only travels straight north, south, east, or west; you<br/>cannot fire it diagonally.</p><p><strong>You cannot harm enemies by shooting them</strong> with the Squareball, though<br/>some types may be temporarily stunned by being hit. Instead, you must<br/>kill the enemies by using special arrow icons called \"Chevrons\" to<br/><strong>propel them into the Black Holes</strong>. (Each black hole can swallow only<br/>one enemy.)<br/> <br/><strong>Press SPACEBAR to drop a Chevron.</strong> You can deploy up to three Chevrons at a time, and <strong>when an enemy touches a Chevron</strong> it is propelled in the direction the arrow points. <strong>You can spin chevrons</strong> by hitting them with the Squareball.</p><p>Most black holes will be buried inside brick walls, or even behind<br/>colored Gates. To win each level, you must unlock and/or dig various<br/>tunnels to the black holes and <strong>arrange your chevrons to guide evil<br/>robots to their doom, then rush for the exit</strong> once it opens!</p><p><strong>Touching any enemy, bullet, or black hole causes instant<br/>permadeath. </strong>There is no win condition and no highest level; the<br/>challenge is to complete as many levels as you can.<br/></p>PLANNED FOR FUTURE VERSIONS:<p>Extra features include new enemies, USB gamepad support, 2-player-local co-op mode, improved color schemes, red-green colorblindness<br/>accessibility support, high-level challenge seeds for the PRNG, new music, and new sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/29717d17600da480acb4b91cff664b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["dto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
