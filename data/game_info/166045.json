I really fricked up. I'm a near billionaire, got almost everything... but I don't got my name in Jrimp 4's credits. I'm sorry to Facebook, my parents... but most of all I'm sorry to myself.\" </p><p>Luckey has stepped down from his position at Facebook, stepped down a staircase straight to Hell.</p><p>This news comes amid a massive sea-change in the tech and gaming industries. Nearly every employee of every company has willfully walked backwards into the fires of Hell. The flames will baptize them. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________</p><p>This is the fourth installment in the Jrimp series. Please play the others first, or else this one won't make a whole lot of sense.</p><p>If you don't wanna click through them, you can watch my friends at Game Thesis play through Jrimp 3, or check out Streamer Charliewinsmore discover the series for the first time. </p><p>What started out as a stupid joke between friends has turned into an (almost) real game that I'm very proud of. </p><p>I love you!
