(Support is dependent on device.)</li><li> Explore 4 worlds (each subdivided into more stages) each with their own theme, hazards and enemies.</li><li> Stages get more and more challenging. (I mean you probably won't get bored?)</li><li> Multiple control schemes (accelerometer or on-screen joystick).</li><li> Accel-O-Matic function! (You can change the way the accelerometer works. Either have the device totally flat, or set a convenient offset angle to hold the device at.)</li><li> Leaderboards and achievements </li><li> Find secrets and gather all the coins in the levels to unlock a last, harder and bigger stage than the others.</li><li> How fast can you finish each level?</li><p>* Consider supporting it via the IAP if you liked the game but have an ad blocker ;) *</p>\n<p>***About the permissions asked***</p>\n<p>Camera, microphone and Storage: Those are needed if you want to use Everyplay for recording your playthroughs. If you are not thinking of sharing playthroughs with your voice over on social media, no need for the Camera or mic.</p>\n<p>But you won't be able to show off your awesome platforming skills :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c21110a2a0c950f499e9fd64f08e0ee6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SinglePixel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
