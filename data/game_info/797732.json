It's about the theme \"Light attracts bugs\".\r\nAs a lost explorer inside a dark dungeon you must find a way out. Unfortunately spiders block your way out and you are only holding a torch. You have to sneak your way through with as less light as possible. Weirdly, the spiders react by the light of your torch.\r\nControls:\r\nPlayer Movement-&gt; WASD\r\nToggle Torch On/Off -&gt; Spacebar\r\nTo enter the Level from the main title just push \"space\".\r\nGoal: Enter the door on the other side.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<em>Programmers</em>:\r\nG Lala - https://itch.io/profile/g-lala\r\nveggiepug - https://itch.io/profile/veggiepug\r\nhelper duck\ud83e\udd86\r\n<em>Composer:</em>\r\nSarmen95 - https://itch.io/profile/sarmen95\r\nSodaguyz - https://sodaguyz.itch.io/\r\n<em>Artist:</em>\r\nART-FUN2ZX - https://art-fun-games.itch.io/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T22:45:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14cd638f57ba3c6cacd053d2b23f8775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Art-Fun-Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
