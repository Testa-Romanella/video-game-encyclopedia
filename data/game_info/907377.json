The disbelief of the population caused these mythical creatures to become weak and lose their powers. Boto, for example, known for being a beautiful young man with the ability to transform into a pink dolphin, lost the ability to transform and now has the appearance of a child! The Cobra Grande became the size of a normal Cobra! The Mapinguari, the terrible cyclops that inhabits the Amazon rainforest, has two eyes again and no longer scares anyone! However, everything changes when each of these legends receives an invitation to participate in a football tournament. The winner will receive the powers back as a prize! After this irresistible proposal, 8 Amazonian legends prepare for the big championship!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet ready for a 1-on-1 Football match with mystical players! Choose your favorite Amazonian legend and fight to score a goal! Who will do better? The Boto? The Uirapuru? The Big Cobra? The Boitata? The power is in your hands!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMain features:<br/>\r\n- Various game modes!<br/>\r\nPlay a Quick Match, or tackle the progressive difficulty level of Tournament Mode! Get to know the Amazonian legends better by playing the Story Mode!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Use special skills!<br/>\r\nEvery character has a special skill that can give you a great advantage during the match! It takes some time to charge, but once it is ready, you will be able to turn into a giant, stun your opponent for a few seconds or even be able to charge a powerful kick that aims to the goal!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Deplete your opponents' stamina!<br/>\r\nNot every mythic player likes to play fair. Physical contact with your opponent will deplete his stamina bar. Once it reaches zero, your opponent will faint for a few seconds, giving you a chance to score a goal! The mythic snakes love to use this strategy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Unlock new possibilities!<br/>\r\nUnlock new characters, cosmetics, and more! All this without spending a penny, only with in-game currency!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Constant updates!<br/>\r\nDid you like the game?
