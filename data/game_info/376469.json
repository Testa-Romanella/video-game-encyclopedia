Merge the ball by collecting other balls so that you grow large enough to accomplish the goal, which is to reach the flag. This game is not as easy as it looks. There are multiple challenges throughout the game. I apologize if there are any bugs; this is my first real game. Currently known bug(s)\u00a0are:-</p>\n<p>&gt; Keyboard input is required for moving platforms. The input required is not a lot though.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Align your camera with your mouse/trackpad. The controls are aligned with respect to the local transform of the camera. Here are the controls:</p>\n<p>Movement: [W] [A] [S] [D] or Arrowkeys</p>\n<p>Jump: [Space]<br/></p>\n<p>Jump on top of enemies e.g. boxes to defeat them. Collect as many coins and defeat as many enemies as possible before reaching the flag. The controls are intentionally difficult. Currently there are minor issues e.g. you must provide a little manual input on moving platforms.<br/></p>\n<p>If you encounter any issues, or have any feedback do not hesitate to comment.<br/></p>\n\n<p>HOPE YOU ENJOY BOUNCEMERGE BY DECIESIVE DOVE GAMES<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CREDITS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ASSETS:<br/>\u00a0 &gt; 3D MODELS: KENNEY'S PLATFORMER KIT (https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit) [CC0]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 SOUND: [All audio from freesound.org under CC0 license]<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Jump (Retro video game SFX) \u00bb Jump_C_07 by cabled_mess (https://freesound.org/s/350900/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Video Game Sounds \u00bb Respawn by juancamiloorjuela (https://freesound.org/s/204316/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&gt; Powerup by JustInvoke (https://freesound.org/s/138485/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Skibka - Winter Music 1.wav by SkibkaMusic (https://freesound.org/s/477594/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt;\u00a0 Tunes \u00bb hmm.wav by Xythe (https://freesound.org/s/115831/)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ville Nousiainen (https://soundcloud.com/mutkanto)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt;\u00a0 Damage sound effect by Raclure (https://freesound.org/s/458867/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt;\u00a0 Game Loops 1 \u00bb BAS-21022014 - Game Loop 11.mp3 by B_Lamerichs (https://freesound.org/s/220314/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&gt;\u00a0 Boss's music for game.mp3 by renatoperes (https://freesound.org/s/456078/)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&gt;\u00a0 Grunt2 - Death Pain.wav by AlineAudio (https://freesound.org/s/416838/)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>GAME DESIGNER AND PROGRAMMER:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ANSH SRIVASTAVA</p>\n<p>I plan to continue development on this project and make it a full fledged game.
