This interactive musical album invites you on a journey to discover how artificial intelligence interprets visuals and transforms them into musical compositions. Our focus is on basic geometric shapes, as we explore the unique sounds of a cube compared to a cylinder. We delve into the properties that define a cube and the characteristics and associations that can be attributed to it. The process begins with one AI generating the cube, while another AI describes its appearance in words. These words are then fed into a third AI that translates them into musical notes. <br/>But can AI truly capture the essence of an image through music? <br/>Find out by youself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T11:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98f6eb5db9c8722b48a49b36be6620a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["salmanas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
