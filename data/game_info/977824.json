Your target is the subway trains and your goal is to make your art travel all over the<br/>\r\ncity.<br/>\r\nSome games allow you to heist a bank where you take out the guards and escape with a<br/>\r\ngiant pay-check. But in All City King, your \u201cbank\u201d is the trains, and your \u201cpay-check\u201d is your<br/>\r\nart or whatever message you feel fit to share. Enter the subway quietly, make your mark on<br/>\r\nthe trains, and get out.<br/>\r\nAs you start your career as a street artist and after you have learned the ropes, your goal is<br/>\r\nto spray paint subway cars in increasingly difficult missions. Sneak past patrolling security<br/>\r\nguards, leave your mark on subway trains, and watch as your masterpiece leaves the<br/>\r\nstation!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic by: Lars Bjerkholt Skotnes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T13:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9536442ca61430c77806e913c48bea.jpg", "website": "https://lategamestudio.myportfolio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Late Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["H\u00f8yskolen Kristiania"], "esrb_rating": null}
