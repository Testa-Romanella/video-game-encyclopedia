However, there's a catch - each puzzle is contained on the faces of cubes. It is possible, and usually necessary, to move the pieces of each puzzle across the faces of their cube as well as onto other cubes to solve the puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOrakyubu contains around 25 puzzles. Each one requires you to approach it in a unique way, so no two puzzles are the same.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-05T00:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dc2006c64318ff5ecc03e90188fe5a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Peter Lavigne"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Peter Lavigne"], "esrb_rating": null}
