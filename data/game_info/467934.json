However, to do so, he must traverse through warm areas where the weather does not suit him well. If not cooled down, our penguin will slowly go insane and his movements will become sluggish. These heat waves hit the penguin at a semi-random rate and the side-effects can range anywhere from slipping on floors, lower jumps, and even moving involuntarily and rejecting all user inputs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a675e55ace4653a26b695a0d5bbc6cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MissingPing"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
