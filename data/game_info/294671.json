In this game you assume the role of someone who is lost in the desert and has found an oasis. In order to defend your water source you need to create a barricade of cacti around it. This can be done by planting cactus seeds around the periphery of the oasis. You have to defend the oasis for a set amount of time in order to win. There are multiple oases to defend and the difficulty progresses with each one. Good luck. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d716aa99464e16d4694d3f040da237.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Arcane_Convolutions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
