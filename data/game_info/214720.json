The reason for that is that some workers had to 'cover' up their bad work and just put concrete over it.\u00a0 (or i just didnt want to draw them...)</p>\n<p>This Game was created for the GMTJAM 2018 with the topic \"Genre without mechanic\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is suposed to show how to play a pipe connecting game withoug actually seeing the pipes. You can also interpret it so that this is a puzzle game where you dont actually see the puzzle directly <br/></p><p>Even if you think that the game is gind of shitty please leave a comment with your thoughts on the idea and concept!</p>\n<p>The Game is currently not very long but hopefully will get the idea across. It also doesnt have sound, sorry.</p><p>EDIT: As i have noticed the day after putting this up that unity has messed up a lot of stuff when building the game as webgl and even windows.\u00a0 So please rate your experience with this game and if you want to know how it should have looked (with correctly placed water that is not hidden under the ground) follow the link in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faf6ab56bfc5a4eff2527fd3771db7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MCR"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
