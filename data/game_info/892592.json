So remember\u2026 Shoot or die!</p>\n<p>Take control of Whisper the Wolf in the universe of Turrican. She is equipped with her Wisp Gun to use fire attacks and Power Lines attack to wipe out a lot of enemies in your way. Gather as many Wisp aliens to get more power with your attacks. Each Wisp has their own unique abilities that are useful in certain areas.</p>\n\n\n<p>The White Wisp is the default equipped Wisp. At first, you can only fire simple shots. But when you gather more of this Wisp, you can fire multiple shots at once, making it the best attack for getting rid of multiple small enemies in wide open areas.</p>\n<p>The bigger the power level of this Wisp is, the more shots you can fire at once.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Laser Wisp allows you to shoot big lasers.\u00a0They are strong and also fast, making it the attack of choice for getting rid of enemies in the front.</p>\n<p>The bigger the\u00a0power level of this Wisp is, the bigger the laser shots will become.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Burst Wisp is useful when dealing with enemies in narrower vertical rooms, as the shots bounce on walls. At level 1, the shots don't bounce. But afterwards, this attack can become handy.</p>\n<p>The bigger the\u00a0power level of this Wisp is, the more shots it will spread after touching a wall.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Spikes Wisp has an unique attack unlike any other Turrican games. When a shot is touching an enemy, it will stay in place. This allows to deal a lot of damage to an enemy and also to get rid of multiple enemies with a single shot.<br/></p>\n<p>The bigger the\u00a0power level of this Wisp is, the longer the shots will stay in place.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Drill Wisp in this game works unlike any other Wisps. It will act as the Surround attack. Press and hold the Surround attack key to unleash a rapid drill attack. You can't move with this attack, but you can turn around in an angle by using the left and right\u00a0arrow keys.<br/></p>\n<p>The bigger the\u00a0power level of this Wisp is, the longer the shots will become.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Original Scratch Game created by <strong>Griffpatch</strong></p>\n<p>Game Modded by <strong>Furrican</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Turrican II</strong> owned by\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Whisper the Wolf</strong> and the <strong>Wisps</strong> owned by\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whisper Artwork</strong> made and owned by\u00a0Aryanda Irshad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T12:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cb/9cbc1bf062daa70822ffdd9b7cf0aad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Furrican"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
