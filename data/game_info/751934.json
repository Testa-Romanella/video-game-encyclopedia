I&#39;ve included a math parser so that you can type equations as answers: if the answer is 0.49^2, for example, you can enter 0.49^2 or 0.49*0.49 without having to work out the multiplication yourself. Some of the puzzles are very challenging, even for people who have studied college-level probability -- try answering them all! If you get stuck, there&#39;s a hint at the bottom of each page, and you can always skip puzzles (and return to them later) by swiping horizontally. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-10T02:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e393fb966598d4762dc2f7cb8150cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
