I recommend you only consider playing this game if you have the emotional capacity for it. I hope that it can give cisgender people an idea of what being transgender is like and for those who are transgender themselves that they are not alone in their experiences and that there's someone else who has felt the pain too. But, I also made this game for myself. I've made this game the same way you might write about the painful, dark memories you have in a journal to help process it and move on.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T02:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b56e1d7c89b5f9ae993123546ba853a9.jpg", "website": "https://www.exodrifter.space/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["exodrifter"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["exodrifter"], "esrb_rating": null}
