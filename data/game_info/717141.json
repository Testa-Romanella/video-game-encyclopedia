Since there were not any\u00a0good paper football video games (that I am aware of) I took it upon myself to create something that combined old school arcade feeling with the game of paper football.\u00a0 Some liberties were taken on ruleset etc in the consideration of gameplay.\u00a0\u00a0This game was built using the GODOT game engine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Arcade Style Paper Football!\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Pixel Push Football is an arcade game with physics driven gameplay based on the rules of paper football.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Fast, physics-based action.\r\n</p>\n<p>All movement is 100% controlled by a physics system meaning each shot is based on your skill and your skill alone. Super fast gameplay means average game length is less than 15 minutes. Touchbacks, Safeties, Touchdowns, Field Goals, Extra Points, 2 Point Conversions, it's all in the game.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 1 Player versus AI\r\n</p>\n<p>Dynamic AI driven solely by the physics system means no two games are ever the same vs the CPU. 3 difficulty levels to choose from.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Local 2 Player versus\r\n</p>\n<p>Innovative two player mechanic where each player sits across from one another and takes turns attempting to score. Think \"old school arcade\". Great on larger screens like tablets.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Tournament Mode\r\n</p>\n<p>Supports 1-6 human players. Single elimination bracket, progress can be saved and resumed.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 3 Unique Challenges with Score tracking.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Shred the Defense: A progressively more challenging based game where you must fling the football towards a receiver located on the field. Defenders will move randomly across the field and block the balls path. You have 8 seconds per turn. 4 downs per score.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Two Minute Drill: Score as many touchdowns as possible within two minutes. Each score will move the ball further away from the goal.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Field Goal Frenzy: Score as many field goals as possible without missing.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Customizable Controls\r\n</p>\n<p>Customize the pointer offset and ball impact force within the settings menu to suit it perfectly to your device.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 \"8 bit\" retro style art and sound.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Customizable Graphics Options\r\n</p>\n<p>- 3 Total Themes\r\n</p>\n<p>- 8 Total Fields\r\n</p>\n<p>- 26 Different Ball Designs\r\n</p>\n<p>- 6 Player Color Choices\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e399f3e75c3237d9c495d5751e5fd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bthacker"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
