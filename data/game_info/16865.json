A second character known as The Grizzle makes his entrance in Chapter 2's desert environment. Chapter 3 will mark the beginning of episodic releases in a semi-regular fashion.<br/><br/>RLR's first chapters are a wild ride with unexpected storytelling, fun twitch gameplay, cutegore retro graphics, and addictive music. It's a funny style mixed with a twisted story surrounding timed jumps in a hardcore twitch runner full of secrets in each level. With chaotic combat reduced to simple gameplay, this mode that feels like racing can be challenging and at times a bit unforgiving.<br/><br/><br/>Fortune's Fool<br/><br/>At its core, Rescue Love Revenge is a sandbox game set in The Old West with the first levels focused on having a retro style with auto-attacking and auto-running singleplayer gameplay where only jumping is key. That is only one realization of the game's components for creating experiences. The game will gradually expand and transition beyond the retro style to realistic and other styles, to full platformer and shooter controls, to couch multiplayer and scalable online play, to level editing and game modifications with extensive Steamworks integration.<br/><br/>During Early Access the default retro mode will receive updates adding new chapters beyond one and two with new custscenes and levels, upgrades to the level selection world map, the RLR runtime level editor, multiplayer and other new modes, and the slow build of the nextgen realistic open world sandbox sequel of sorts, almost like two games in one plus mods and episodes for tons of hours of overall gameplay.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c4007c1ad8e1897a4bbd0faa2ba857e.jpg", "website": "http://RescueLoveRevenge.com/", "rating": 1.86, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 268, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hatchlight", "Trepid Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rich Pine"], "esrb_rating": null}
