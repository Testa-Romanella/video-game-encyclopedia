Set around Halloween, your goal is to throw the best Monster Bash. This game was made in a little under two weeks during the Cozy Autumn Game Jam (2022) hosted by Firith Studio. See the jam here:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/cozy-autumn-game-jam-2022.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Customers will arrive on the right of your screen and order a drink.</li><li>Click ingredients around your shop to build their order. You can't add later drink ingredients until you add the earlier ones (for example, you can't add sprinkles until you have added whipped cream). You can change the drink as much as you want to before giving it to the customer, so feel free to try out all the options to see what they look like!</li><li>When your drink is finished, click the green bell to give it to the customer. Successful drinks will earn you five gold each.</li><li>Click the green banner next to the clock to open the shop.
