However, Bubba is nowhere to be seen! Can she find her pet amidst the infestation?\r\n<br/>\r\nControls &amp; Info\r\n<p>The current demo is, um, quite incomplete.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> are the movement keys</li><li><strong>Escape</strong> opens the inventory</li><li><strong>Spacebar</strong> jumps</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> fires the gun</li><li><strong>E</strong> lets you open cursed books.</li></ul>\n<p>I'm not entirely satisfied with these controls, as I'm not sure what the best control scheme is for keyboard-only action-adventure games. I\u00a0intend to add remappable controls and built-in\u00a0controller support, but I\u00a0would love to hear feedback on possible default control schemes as well.</p>\n<p>The current dungeon layout is also for demo purposes only.\r\n</p>\n<p>Oh, and there's no music.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>YET</em>\n</p>\n<p>I have already started making the music, it's just, um, not in this demo.\r\n</p>\n<p>Yeesh, I really am setting myself up for disaster here, aren't I.</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>Amelia Watson, despite having a health bar, is immortal.</li><li>Enemy animations don't pause on defeat. If a Takodachi is in the middle of\u00a0its attack animation when it's killed, the halo will still appear when it would otherwise.</li><li>If you push the block into the button/receptacle and then leave the room, the block will respawn but the button will not deactivate.</li><li>Apparently if you press spacebar in the pause menu, it plays the jump sound effect. And since you don't actually jump, you can spam it to play the sound over and over</li><li>If you open a cursed book, a ghost of the item you received from it displays above the book forever</li><li>Pushing the block onto the button doesn't actually activate anything</li><li>The bullet time effect from shooting mid-air slows horizontal momentum more than it should, for some reason</li><li>Apparently there is an unusual blur on monitors with refresh rates other than 60hz</li><li>If you press a bunch of keys all at once on the title screen, you will be greeted by a hilarious bug, in which the dungeon loads multiple times on top of itself. This causes numerous issues, and is also kind of funny.</li><li>This demo exists</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\r\nWant to follow development, or contact me?\r\n<p>If you're interested in getting updates on the current progress, you can follow my Twitter, or join my Discord!</p>\n<p>I have a tendency to miss messages, but the fastest way to contact me\u00a0is to post in the Discord.
