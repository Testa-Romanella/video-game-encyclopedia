The final animation will probably feature different models, music, sounds and scene and will be rotoscoped, to give it a more artistic\u00a0 cinematic feel.<br/><br/>This was the first thing I ever produced when I first downloaded coppercube a few years ago - there was a lot of learning andtril/error involved. Took around a week to finish - I expect the final version of the animation will be a bit more polished/finished.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T08:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616639ff76881ec0836c09a8402b591f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VP"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
