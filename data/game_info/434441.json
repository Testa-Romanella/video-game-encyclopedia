The story of this build well emulates the uncertainty of the development of the game itself, and the FPS addition to the parkour adds another dimension of stress to this retro-aesthetic kind of game. </p>\n<p>Backstory:\r\nI essentially gave up due to choosing a waaay too unrealistic project, and got lost into lots of different things. And then I decided: \u201cI feel so bad giving up, I\u2019ll just go all in, I\u2019ll do this and that to make it at least playable, and publish it regardless!\u201d So that I recycled my mechanics into what this build of the game is! And I did that with 10 hours left, so I expect there to be lots of bugs, and also lots of polishing that needs to be done. But with only 10 hours of time, I can\u2019t be that disappointed at myself.</p>\n<p>I will probably polish this further and work on it more, and also expand on it a little, and once I\u2019ve done all that I might as well release the \u201cfinished\u201d version, I\u2019ll probably release that on the website I have.</p>\n<p>Thanks!\r\n:&gt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:07:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/19891b0c7ecdeb5e467c21d2db825947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diinki"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
