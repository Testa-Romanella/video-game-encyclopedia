It is meant for those who do not know batch so they can instead use the options given in the game engine. Along with the game engine is LD Animate. It is not required to use the game engine but can be used along with options in the game engine(e.g. Game Opener) to add cutscenes. It is a primitive animation tool but it does indeed animate.</p>\r\nWarning: instead of spaces you may be required to use _ on some machines while making your game. In order to check make a basic game(e.g. name it then add text and pause).\r\n\n<p>Tips while making your game:</p>\n<ul><li>Use pause commands to wipe information off the screen.</li><li>Set a variable to %PlayerVar% to save information a player entered for later.</li><li>Plan ahead before you start making it, to fix a mistake you will need to go into the file to fix it.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ead853d4a1039a33ad5b2ae34f53cd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
