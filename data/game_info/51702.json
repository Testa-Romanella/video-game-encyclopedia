On one\u2019s way to the Styx he or she will see such kind of flowers all the way, so manjusaka can make one recall his or her life in the previous incarnation when one is transmigrating.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLegend: <br/>\r\nA very long time ago, manjusaka in clusters bloomed at both banks of a long river. Who accompanied manjusaka for thousands of years were a flower elf and a leaf elf.  The flower elf was at one bank and the leaf elf was at the other one. They were in love with each other and missed each other very much. But they couldn\u2019t see each other for once because the flowers and leaves of manjusaka couldn\u2019t appear at the same time. They missed each other but couldn\u2019t see each other for generations after generations. One day, when they couldn\u2019t bear their miss any more, they disobeyed the God\u2019s order and saw each other in a sneak way. <br/>\r\nThat year the brilliant red flowers and verdant leaves reflected each other with more beauty. But that annoyed the God so he punished them and threw them into transmigration and cursed them so they couldn\u2019t be with each other for generations after generations and continued their torturing lives in the world. From then on, for every transmigration on their way to the Styx when they smell the other side\u2019s fragrance and recall their life in their previous incarnation and promise to be with the other side together they will sink into another transmigration once again. \u3000<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPS.Trading Cards and Achievements will come out with the final version.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f85ec56891d99128eafdd8524ca3ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 52, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4e03\u5f69\u7ed8\u8272"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SakuraGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
