Inspired by the likes of Dark Souls and Shadow of the Colossus.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is a VERY early prototype. It's pretty bare-bones,\u00a0 takes around 20 mins to beat. Keep that in mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Story &amp; setting:</strong></p>\n<p>The Last Wrath is an in-development video game by VoidLynx Game Studios.</p>\n<p>Set in a grim post-apocalyptic world, where a once peaceful civilization of \"rat people\" suffer the wrath of their gods after loosing their faith.</p>\n<p>The theme is dark. The wrath of the gods caused the world to fall into ruins, and the once glorious civilization has been reduced to a few isolated tribes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dying children, famine, disease, madness, corrupted minds, excessive greed....</p>\n<p>However, the Head Priest of one of the tribes has discovered an ancient writing, describing a ritual that could grant the species a pardon from the gods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a sacrifice: The life of their greatest warrior. One that could defeat 7 dark titans and even a god.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You, the player, will take the mantle of said Chosen One.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along the journey, you'll learn the history of the civilization, what really caused all of this to happen, the secrets behind the curse imposed by the gods, and how you fit into a prophecy that is bigger and more complex than it will initially seem.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired (to some degree, it's a 2D game after all) by games such as Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls, The Last\u00a0Wrath is a minimalistic, action-adventure, boss rush, bullet hell game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The main game loop consists of heading to a new area, talking to NPCs (to know where to go, fill your map, learn the lore, etc.), finding a save point, finding the boss, defeating it (may take several times), and progressing in the world.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The bosses are the only enemies in the game, and they all attack you with what are known as energies, and they can randomly be Good Energy or Bad Energy\u00a0(yeah we'll come up with better names later on).</p>\n<p>Basically, Bad Energy (color GREEN) is, well, bad. It kills you. You want to avoid this.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Good Energy\u00a0(color RED) charges your sword. This is good, you want to catch these forms of energy.</p>\n\r\nRED charges your sword, GREEN damages you\r\n\n<p>Your only weapon in the game, the Ceremonial Sword, can be charged with Good Energy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You can swing an uncharged sword, and it swings like any other sword, but it's ineffective against the Dark Titans the gods have set up for you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But swinging a charged sword, releases a huge blast of energy that damages the bosses.\r\n</p>\n\r\nNormal Swing<br/>\n\r\nCharged Swing\r\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Move -\u00a0WASD</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n<p>Skip dialog -\u00a0Space</p>\n<p>Slash sword - Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Dash - Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Toggle Map - Tab</p>\n<p>Pause menu - Escape</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:11:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16d07b2e76be9513124d09174410e546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoidLynx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
