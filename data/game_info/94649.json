I love you all, every one of you. </p><p>For news about future releases, you can follow me on Twitter where in addition to being obnoxious about that, I mostly tweet about my real cats. </p><p>Again, thank you so much, everyone.</p><p>I've also added a download version if people want! It's just an html file inside a zip, so it should run in any web browser at all-- great for stealthy workplace petting. It will also fill the entire browser window, instead of running inside an iframe like it does here on itch. I am asking for at least a dollar if you want the download, but if you really truly can't afford that, let me know and we can probably work something out.</p><p>2016 update: I'm given to understanding that this version of Twine doesn't like to play nicely when run from local file locations. I'll see this is fixed by updating, but in the mean time, you can run it from a Dropbox or Google Drive location no problem.</p><p>If you're having issues with this version here on itch, you can try playing in Chrome-- that seems to be working for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98e/98eb4cffcbd4f92b29a5a41ff3819a9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["neongrey"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
