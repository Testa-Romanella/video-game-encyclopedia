{"id": 703870, "slug": "food-fling", "name": "Food Fling", "name_original": "Food Fling", "description": "<p>Food Fling is an international travelling farmer festival that goes around the world to different locations in a particular region to <strong>celebrate farmers and their produce &amp; foods made with said produce for a specific region</strong>. The festival will go to a particular region\u2019s most popular and successful farming towns and set up the festival there. This farmer\u2019s festival is held depending on the region it is highlighting and when their harvest season is. For this year\u2019s Food Fling festival, it is held during late spring in April to celebrate the harvest season for the East Asia region. Another reason why the Food Fling festival is held is to also bring attention and awareness to how much food wastage goes on in the world yearly. So, the festival not only celebrates the farmers, their hard work and produce, but also to help educate and raise awareness on ways that food wastage can be reduced by the consumers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tA way that the Food Fling festival does this is by having a PR stunt on the 3rd day of the festival. During the first 2 days, the festival tells its vendors to keep all the food that is unable to be sold, spoiled, not ripe, over ripe, etc, instead of throwing it away. On the 3rd day of the Food Fling festival, the organizers will ask 4 representatives from the 4 showcased countries to volunteer and enter in a friendly food fight contest where they would fight one another with the spoiled or unused food. This is to show just how much food that can be wasted during this festival period which can lead them to imagine how much food is wasted per year and to really drive home the point that both farmers and consumers need to work together in order to overcome this issue. At the end of the food fight, the last person standing without tapping out would win the title of Fling Champions for that year.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1fba36815145410f576343c597c3533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DregShao"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
