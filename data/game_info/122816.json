Experience a unique dream world surrounded by gorgeous 3D sprites and pixels!</p>\n<p>You won't find any auto-attack here, standing in one place trading blows with a monster, not nearly exciting enough. In our world, you swing your sword, or shoot your fireball, and move to dodge before your enemy strikes you! Take the fight to the nightmares in a live action FPS-style combat system. Or duel other players to see who is the true champion of the city!</p>\n<p>Be a part of a vast Underlight City of dreamers. Real people, just like you, creating real characters. There are no pre determined paths for you to follow and no specified end game. You are in control of how your character interacts with the other characters creating true conflict and resolution. It's your dream to make.</p>\n<p>Enter a world of complete player driven stories and interactions. There are no bots here handing out the exact same quests. How will you get wrapped up and proceed? Will you become a Teacher and help others grow? Will you take the noble path of a Ruler or Guardian of one of the Houses? Maybe you will hone your fighting skills and become a great warrior. The choice is yours to make. Create your own compelling character backstory and flesh it out with fellow Dreamers in the dynamic dream city of Underlight. Your actions and experiences will have a direct impact on an ever evolving story line with rich and engaging characters, histories, beliefs and factions! Every other Dreamer you speak to in Underlight is played by a real human being.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fceaf95a25e1aa000d03395012f37c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BClementoni"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
