The game is not finished. That being said, you play as a child who finds a book in a toybox at their school, and upon opening it is sucked into a strange and beautiful world filled with mushroom people. You must find a way to escape and get home. This game is a point and click story for kids and nostalgic adults, and only needs a mouse to play. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>A Mushroom's tale is the result of the combined efforts of 3 Mushie Mates!
