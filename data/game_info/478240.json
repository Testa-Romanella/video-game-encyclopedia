You have a plan to mess up everyone's lives. You're gonna rewind all clocks.</p>\n<p>In this game, you'll have to break into people's houses, find their clocks, and rewind them.\u00a0 If you'd like to, you can also play with people's things, such as food, books, toys...</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Click to interact</strong> with objects and rewind clocks.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Mouse to move the camera</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Arrow keys or WASD to move.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HINTS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- All houses contain 2 or 3 clocks. There's always one on the second floor. All houses have a wall clock.</p>\n<p>- On Day (level) 2, you'll have to find a lockpick to open the doors. It can be found in your house. It is a long black stick.</p>\n<p>- On Day 3, the circles around the policemen are their sight. If you get into their circle, you get caught.</p>\n<p>-On Day 4, you won't be able to move the camera. You can have that as a challenge, to find the clock like that. I can assure you it won't be behind you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Made in 7 days by TheInkSkeleton for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2 ~Rewind~</p>\n<p>- Some textures are taken from google images, but most things I did them myself.</p>\n<p>- Sound effects are from freesound.com, and the music is a combination of:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVTkB-BIvM<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLQw6dXX-JU<br/></p>\n<p>- Alright, the day 4 thing wasn't intentional, it was a bug.
