The demo features the first portion of the town recreated from memory using free assets. As it is only a tech demo, it does not have an ending, because I did not program enemies yet.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was only uploaded for learning purposes!<br/></p>\n<p>If this project does not get C&amp;D'd by Konami, I might make it actually playable sometime. Until then, it is only a measly, buggy recreation.<br/></p>\n<p>THIS IS ONLY A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECT. TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70aed7b254d34a58af6a4410b9992a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T-ReXx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
