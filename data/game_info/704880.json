Everything from player behaviour to time powers and enemies is fully implemented, though some edge case bugs are to be expected. Essentially all models, animations, code and whatnot is self made, with sound and some textures being from the original game. The game was made over an autumn holiday and I didn't initially plan to even release it, so don't expect miracles; It's very incomplete and unpolished.<br/></p>\n<p>Supports xbox controller and mouse&amp;keyboard. As a leftover debug feature, you can press keys 1-5 to give yourself any time control powerup.<br/></p>\n<p>The project is unofficial, should go without saying. Development will continue if there's reasonable support.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:22:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffbeec3ab8f2f2582cfc7e21ff776445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aarontti"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
