The currently collected item is shown in the upper left corner.</p>\n<p>Doors will open from a distance (when you're able to unlock them) and doing so will prevent the character from stopping and allow Medbot to move quickly and smoothly through doorways.</p>\n<p>When monsters have access to crew members they will attack them and the game will end.</p>\n<p>Medbot does not have an unlimited supply of medical supplies. Medbot needs to resupply after healing a crew member before healing another.</p>\n<p>Art was created with PyxelEdit and code was created with Unity</p>\n<p>I like making the 8-Bit music and sounds.</p>\n<p>These are the free audio stuffs from this project...</p>\n<p>Magical 8-Bit Synth -- \u00a0http://www.ymck.net/en/download/magical8bitplug/<br/></p>\n<p>NES Synth --\u00a0https://www.mattmontag.com/projects-page/nintendo-vst<br/></p>\n<p>Valhalla Tape Echo --\u00a0https://valhalladsp.com/</p>\n<p>Riviera Grain Reverb-- https://nuspaceaudio.com/2017/02/07/riviera-fast-hybrid-reverb-plugin-for-modeli...</p>\n<p>Utility Channel Strip --\u00a0http://www.vennaudio.com/utility/</p>\n<p>No6 Limiter --\u00a0https://vladgsound.wordpress.com/plugins/limiter6/</p>\n<p>Kirnu Arpeggiator --\u00a0http://www.artovaarala.com/download/download.php</p>\n<p>Miqu Sequencer -- http://www.klangmanipulation.de/indexvst.html</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
