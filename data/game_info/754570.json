For the sake of this project, we called ourselves C Project Purple.<br/></p>\n<p>Because we've chosen to follow this course as a graduation program instead of a minor, we were bound to certain rules when choosing the subject of our project. We were supposed to choose from one of three causes. We chose the one where we had to work with the Hedy language. Hedy is a python-based language with the purpose to teach children the concept of programming. \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Hedy?</strong></p>\n<p>Hedy is a gradual programming language designed to teach kids to program using an easier approach to syntax. The language is initially available on a web app with several levels of difficulties, in the first levels the rules are very similar to natural language but they become increasingly complex while proceeding.\r\n</p>\n<p>The nice thing about Hedy is that Hedy is gradual. That means that you do not have to learn all the rules at once. The first few levels do not have many rules, so you can get used to programming comfortably. In every level we add new rules, increasing the number of commands that you know. Commands are instructions for a computer.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3269b445263d98c0b4f33a5d36f8af25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C Project Purple"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
