It is a job simulation of working at a lost and found. The main idea is to return objects to their owners while questioning them if the description is too ambiguous.</p>\n<p>For the jam I only got the basic game loop done with a few example items included. I hope to keep working on it and include new content like more complex items such as backpacks and coats. You'll eventually be able to search these items in order to identify the rightful owner.\u00a0I also originally had dishonest people I wanted to add that would try and get items that weren't theirs.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I only tested on Oculus so let me know if Vive or Index has issues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music is by Antti Luode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674c2022a454c1861ac396339cda8bad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Brown"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
