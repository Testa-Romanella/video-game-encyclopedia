Unfortunately - she loves furniture, and Rude Bear  has none. Better steal a bunch of furniture before she comes back at  9PM.\r\n</p>\n<p>== What\u2019s a Rude Bear? ==\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the 20th Rude Bear  game in the RB core series, the 22nd Ludum Dare extended universe Rude  Bear game, and the 24th extended universe Rude Bear game. It was made  for Ludum Dare 45\u2019s jam, under the theme \u201cStart With Nothing\u201d. \r\n</p>\n<p>== My own feedback ==\r\n</p>\n<p>I  wish I\u2019d got better audio and player feedback in here, and a proper  rating system at the end with more depth to it. I wrote the dialogue but  there wasn\u2019t enough time to implement all of the little things I wanted  to do, like admonish you for too many beds, check the upstairs and  downstairs. Everything had a point value it was worth, but I abandoned  that eventually. There is still a win condition but you\u2019re unlikely to  find it lol.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                             === CREDITS ===         @AlexRoseGames - Code, Design, Animation, sound design/SFX                        @BitsAndCrafts - Dope ass Art                             @Atmospherium - Music &amp; SFX", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed49bab64fb8bbd03566d0bd0125a06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Rose"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
