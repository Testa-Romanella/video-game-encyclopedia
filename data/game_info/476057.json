The idea came from looking at my family's pet fish, and seeing how they'd grown from 4 little fish's\u00a0to a school of around 25.</p>\n<p>So this is an idle game about growing a pond of fish from your first minnow to a thriving school.<br/></p>\n<p>Take pictures of your fish and decorations to earn money to buy more fish decorations. Try to unlock all four fish patterns, or just relax and check in on your fish every so often and see how they've grown.<br/><br/>In game photos are saved in the Pond Pics_Data folder. If you take any good ones post them in the comments, I'd love to see them.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Reed model:\u00a0https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/plant/grass/reed-cartoon-low-poly-mesh</p>\n<p>Water lily models:\u00a0https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/plant/flower/low-poly-water-lilies</p>\n<p>Camera sound:\u00a0https://www.soundjay.com/camera-sound-effect.html</p>\n<p>The rest: me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T06:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41b/41b736b00fa0ce5c473da557d645daff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gerbiltron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
