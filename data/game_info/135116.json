This is also the first time I've ever really done game development, too, along with using most of the tools involved. I was really concerned about not having anything that I could submit by the end of the game jam period, but it worked out in the end.</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare 41's theme was \"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres.\" For this project, the genres are City Builder and Platformer. The game overall is rather simplistic, but this is the first time I've done this kind of thing. I hope you enjoyed it!</p>\n<p>Instructions:<br/>W/A/Left Arrow/Right Arrow - Move<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Q - Build House<br/>E - Build Bridge<br/>F - Restart\u00a0<br/>M - Mute Music<br/>Escape - Quit Game</p>\n<p>Tools:<br/>Unity -\u00a0https://unity3d.com/<br/>GraphicsGale -\u00a0https://graphicsgale.com/us/<br/>BeepBox -\u00a0https://www.beepbox.co/<br/>bfxr -\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e642a5bd6fa8d4bf3cf8214611273e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TKShadow"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
