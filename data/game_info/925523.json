After Death gets tired of his responsibilities, he approaches the almost-famous musician Jack Vile with a startling proposal: he wants to swap jobs! As Jack, dash and slice your way through the bizarre realm of Limbo, the underworld\u2019s waiting room. But it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds \u2013 Limbo will fight back at every turn, deploying guardian drones and continuously sapping away Jack\u2019s speed. Reap the lost souls of Limbo to briefly restore that lost speed, or else be caught and cast out of the underworld forever. Jack\u2019s newfound mentor, formerly known as Death, waits at the end of each level, eager to show off his latest songs. Reach him to earn his respect \u2013 and gain more of his powers. Will Jack prove himself a worthy successor?</p>\n<p>KEEP IN MIND, this game is only a basic prototype and is defintely not finished.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n\n<p>Aidan J. - Creative Director https://firelightaidan.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Arty Mead - Sound designer/composer https://meedling.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>saw__ball - pixel artist  https://saw-ball.itch.io/</p>\n<p>PizzaOwl - Game Artist/Animator https://pizzaowl.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Fallen64 - Main Developer https://fallen64.itch.io<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrow Keys to Move</p><p>Z to Attack</p><p>C to Roll</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:13:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b53cda220a3e41046fd53eafa28ad75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fallen64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
