Instead, we took a different approach and focused on delivering a shorter, more intense gameplay experience. Myriads: Renaissance is our personal contribution to the genre, and if you like the idea of a small but challenging 4X game with city-builder and tower defence mechanics then Myriads: Renaissance is the game for you!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Extend your capital island by chaining shards of various biomes and sizes.\"<br/><br/><br/>\"Resist waves of powerful corsairs.
