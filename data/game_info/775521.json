I decided to add in multiple camera angles that can be switched between using buttons, a pause menu, new directional light cubes to click on (pink is North, green is West, and blue is East), as well as Random Skeleton Event.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I decided to move all of the settings from previous project\u2019s footer into the pause menu, where it makes more sense to place settings. The end result is maximized screen real estate, with only the point counter, pause button, and camera controls normally being on-screen. The pause screen itself is quite snazzy, with a spinning gargoyle. The aesthetic of rotating mono-colored low-poly models for pause menus is something I\u2019ve taken from a favorite childhood game, Spyro the Dragon for the Sony Playstation. <br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tucked away in the pause menu, under the \u201cSuper Secret Options\u201d heading is the ability to enable Random Skeleton Event. From that moment onwards, it has a 33% chance of occurring every 10 seconds. Be vigilant.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of the 3D models (the table, the mug, the clock, the statue) from reused from Project 2 and were created in Blender by me back in January for a game jam.
