Things have been really tough lately, it's going to be so good to relax. This park seems pretty out of the way, I don't think I've heard of it before and it's quite a drive to get to the entrance. But a day trip is probably what I need, just get away from the city and see what nature has to offer. I'll be sure to bring my camera phone in case anything cool is there to see. It looks like there's a few buildings and a lighthouse on the map but I can't find any actual pictures of the park online. That's strange, but I guess it makes sense given how far off the highway it is. Maybe when I get back home I'll upload my photos to share!</em></p>\r\nControls\r\nMoving the player\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>WASDMove character<br/>ShiftRunSpaceJumpEscapeToggle pause menu<br/>\r\nUsing the Camera\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>Move Mouse<br/>Moves the camera / Look around<br/>Right Click<br/>Toggles Camera to take photo<br/>Left Click<br/>When camera toggled, takes photograph<br/>\n<p>Full\u00a0 credits can be found inside credits.txt.<br/></p>\r\nTeam Credits\r\n<strong>Team</strong><strong>Role</strong><strong>Twitter</strong>Brian Cain<br/>Programming, Level and Game Design<br/>@brian_cainCasey Frantum<br/>Sound and Music Design<br/>@caseyfrantum<br/>Will Lewis<br/>Level and Game Design, Story<br/>@gamewillpdx<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/153cd4794e48db0497120135643e9387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Brian Cain  \ud83c\udf00"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
