{"id": 801650, "slug": "hamptercom", "name": "hampter.com", "name_original": "hampter.com", "description": "<p>Instructions:<br/></p>\n<p>On startup, create a login by typing a name for the new game, or click the die on the right to have a name generated for you. When you have a name you like, click \"New Game.\" If you're coming back, save files that the game can see will be listed below \"Saved Games.\" Click on the one you want to play and it will auto-fill the name into the input field. Or you can type in the name yourself. Either way once the name is in just click \"Load Game.\"<br/></p>\n<p>Once in the game, you will see a cage with a wheel and a hamster. You can left-click and drag on any hamster to move it. You can drag hamsters between screens by simply grabbing the hamster and switching tabs. You can right click on a hamster to look at its stats.<br/></p>\n<p>Q - Switch tabs to the left<br/></p>\n<p>E - Switch tabs to the right</p>\n<p>Get more hamsters and cages from the Store. The store has different tabs for the different items you can buy. You have to click the \"New ___\" button any time you change what you're buying. The store keeps the most recently selected item in case you change your mind. This is most useful in the case of buying hamsters, as they're randomized. Whenever you're satisfied with your selected item, click \"Buy\" and the item will be added to your Basket at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>The Basket is a way for you to carry items besides hamsters between game tabs.<br/></p>\n<p>In the Hamsters tab, at the bottom left of the screen there is a toggle that switches between which objects you can move. You can drag items from the basket into this tab in any mode, but you can only drag items into the basket if the game is in the appropriate mode.</p>\n<p>Breed hamsters in the Nursery by dragging them into the two boxes at the top of the screen. Hamsters must have an age of 1 to breed. The baby hamsters will spawn below where you can check their stats. Drag a hamster into the trashcan to the bottom right to get rid of the hamster. You can also trash non-hamster items. Trashing an item gives you back a little money.<br/></p>\n<p>At the top left of the screen are the mute button and the time speed toggle. At the top right of the screen there is the \"Main Menu\" button, which will save the game and return to the main menu. It is suggested that you save often, as there is no auto-save.</p>\n<p>In the event of a crash, the game will return to the main menu, attempting to save as much of the current state of the game as it can. This is no guarantee that your progress will be saved, it's only there to offer some security.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T08:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c1370b4d3968ab660de01d1fa61b21d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["p13_l0v3r"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
