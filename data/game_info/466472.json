Theme is 'out of control'.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine having a machine that can fill your buckshot bullet with various effects ?</p>\n<p>Except that machine is actually a slot machine. You only have little control over what kind of effect your bullet will be, but that's where the fun comes from.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls :\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Switch highlighted column and row in the slot machine</li><li>Mouse - Target enemy</li><li>LMB - Shoot</li><li>R - Respin slot machine</li><li>Esc - Pause</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All game's content are made by me except for the fonts, which are made by :</p>\n<p>codeman38 &amp;\u00a0Daniel Linssen<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game became <strong>out of control</strong> at some point during the development. There might be some bugs I didn't know and I believe that some of the bullets are also behaving weirdly. Kindly tell me if you find one.</p>\n<p>Any critique and suggestions is very welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/7437cf1dcc59bf8f92be99a09935466c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["syauqihh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
