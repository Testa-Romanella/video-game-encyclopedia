Or even more, shopping with their girlfriends. So \r\nwe based our game on this.</p>\n<p>Imagine you go shopping with your \r\nsweetie, you\u2019re really rich and she knows she can spend as much as she \r\nlikes. What could you ideally do? Since you don\u2019t want to sleep on a \r\nsofa tonight you want to keep her satisfied. That means that you keep up\r\n and pay for stuff. On the other hand, you don\u2019t have unlimited \r\npatience. You get upset with each box you need to carry at given moment \r\nas it weights something. Also you get upset with each bounce with some \r\nother shopper or a wall.</p>\n<p>You win if you reach the top of bar with \r\nsatisfaction in the game. You will loose if your love is not satisfied \r\nat all or if you are fully upset.</p>\n<p>We wish you a nice game and ladies, please accept you apologies for such a stupid idea behind the game.</p>\n<p>The game was created by four students of programming art at Charles University, in Prague.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["davda"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
