The Ogre can also throw debuffs that will harm the player, but watch out as the game will spawn buffs for the player automatically which can help the player out of a sticky situation!\u00a0 The Ogre has one more ability... he can control wind. The Ogre can control the wind direction which will therefore affect the players movement and position and even make the wind more powerful for a short time. The Ogre can only use a select amount of abilities in a selected amount of time\u00a0as there is a cooldown for all of these abilities. However, that is <strong>not</strong> everything,\u00a0as the floor is a trampoline and will cause the situation to become<em> Ogre The Top</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player 1 (Little guy)</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Player 2 (Ogre)</strong></p>\n<p>MAKE SURE NUM LOCK IS ON!!!!</p>\n<p>Numpad 7 - Spawns Obstacle</p>\n<p>Numpad 8 - Spawns Debuff for Player</p>\n<p>Numpad 5 - Changes Wind Direction</p>\n<p>Numpad 6 - Increases Wind Speed</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programmers:</strong></p>\n<p>William Hughes - roxra.github.io</p>\n<p>Ryan Masson</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Victoria Herbert</p>\n<p>Katy Byatt - https://www.instagram.com/katiana84o/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Dylan Enstone -\u00a0https://dpenstone99.wixsite.com/blog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e940ad7adb495284f44778ebd406d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roxra", "Fenodyree", "Katiana840", "AssassinGamer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
