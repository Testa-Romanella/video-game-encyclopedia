He doesn't like people and he <strong>really</strong> doesn't like smiling. He didn't even want to go to the hypnotist in the first place. Hypnotism won't work.<br/><br/>Negative Norman is a tiny platforming game about a guy trying to become a better person. It started off as a school assignment, but turned into a much more personal project somewhere along the way.<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game by:</p>\n<p>Vuk M.
