Immerse yourself in a little world of vibrancy and nature, but wander away into the forest and you may encounter some strange surprises.</p>\n<p>This game is an experiment in visual style, supernatural themes and environmental storytelling, made over several weeks just for fun.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>Music was made for this game by Carl Powell.
