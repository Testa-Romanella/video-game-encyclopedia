Don't worry, there are as many continues as you need. The goal is to concentrate and quickly memorize card locations. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter beating a Limited Attempts stage, you'll move onto Timed Attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn a Timed Attempts stage, not only are you challenged with a maximum of two incorrect matches, but you also have only 25 seconds to complete all matches.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first few stages will be easy, but as more cards are introduced into the mix, Double Memory becomes a real challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou're invited to push your memory to its limits in...Double Memory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eed9b150aa8f8838ca4405f21762597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyler Stansfield Jaggers"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Overidon Omnimedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
