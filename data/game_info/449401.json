We were a bit ambitious and spent a lot of time in a short time span to get it to the point it is at the moment, but learnt a lot along the way :) </p>\n<p>We don't particularly enjoy grocery shopping, and the current pandemic has made the prospect of doing our shopping even worse. This game is our light-hearted expression of our dislike for the grocery shopping chore. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a556e0cf7f6e1036efbaee575cf7412f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarkW250"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
