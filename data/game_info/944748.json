Is this game free?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Yes. The game is free and I accept no payment for it as I've used several assets belonging to HoYoverse to create it. If you wish to support my original content, find me on Twitter or other platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>2. When will this game be finished?</strong></p>\n<p>I do not have a specific date to offer because this is a hobby project I make in my free time. I would also like to first receive feedback and see whether people enjoy it and want to more of it, which is why I'm releasing it as a beta version or early access, if you will.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who is this game for?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It's for people who like Xiao, Lumine and/or Xiaolumi and want to see them in some fun, fluffy and lighthearted scenarios. Future routes may or may not include darker content. Age rating and content warnings will be updated accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Will you make a version with Aether?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. Aether is cool, but\u00a0I picked Lumine as my Traveler so I'm only interested in making stories from Traveler Lumine's point of view. Also, I'm simply a fan of Xiaolumi.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>5. Will this game be available on iOS in the future?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I don't know.\u00a0I will look into it\u00a0but I can't make any promises on whether an iOS release will happen.</p>\n\r\n\u27e3. \u00b7 \u00b7.\u00a0\u00a0\u25c7\u00a0\u00a0. \u00b7 \u00b7.\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p><em>HoYoverse please don't sue me, I just like Xiaolumi. </em>\ud83d\ude14</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T12:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/707d9ec7b70df242a5b7bda7d75da042.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Krisi Chiki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
