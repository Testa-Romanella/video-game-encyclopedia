The surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nMALLSOFT\r\n<p>Mallsoft (also known as Mallwave) is a vaporwave subgenre themed after retro shopping malls.<br/><br/>Often based on corporate lounge music, it is meant to conjure images of shopping malls, grocery stores, lobbies, and other places of public commerce. Mallsoft artists typically elicit nostalgic memories of these retail establishments, even to those who did not experience them, firsthand through easy listening, bossa nova, and smooth jazz music while providing commentary on consumerism and corporate capitalism. Much of the enjoyment from listeners is derived from nostalgia and the \"pleasure of remembering for the sake of the act of remembering itself\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nINTERNET CONNECTIVITY (STEAM VERSION)\r\n<p>Play with friends across many random Mall layouts, Complete different Malls or challenges and work your way to the top of the global leaderboards, share your playthroughs or guides for each Mall.
