Lead your defenses to victory in \"Times Of War.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to \"Times Of War,\" an immersive tower defense game developed by TARTORGAMES S.R.L. In this captivating game, you will find yourself engaged in intense battles against a wide range of military vehicles, including cars, tanks, helicopters, and planes. As they relentlessly advance towards your base, your strategic prowess will be tested as you deploy and utilize three unique types of towers to halt their progress and safeguard your territory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPrepare to explore a variety of structures and resources at your disposal. The structures available for placement include Gun Towers, Laser Towers, Plasma Towers, Power Plants, and Cryogen Refrigerators. Each structure possesses its own unique characteristics and special abilities, providing you with a diverse range of defensive options.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn \"Times Of War,\" you have the ability to upgrade your towers, enhancing their range, attack rate, and damage capabilities. With each upgrade, your towers gain additional special abilities, further empowering your defensive strategy. Furthermore, you can strategically place traps along the vehicle path, detonating them at critical moments. These traps require resources such as inflammable barrels, different types of plates, and cement bags.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the game, you will collect and manage resources, including inflammable barrels, cement bags, as well as granite, wood, and metal plates. Additional resources in the form of battery capacity, overall electric capacity, and general consumption capacity play crucial roles in maintaining and expanding your defensive capabilities. Resource collection and storage can be optimized through the upgrading of your depot, allowing for increased storage space.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile placing structures, it is essential to consider the battery cost associated with each placement. Power Plants, when strategically positioned, generate electricity periodically, thereby increasing your battery capacity. They also contribute to the overall electric capacity. However, be mindful of your general consumption capacity, as exceeding it will cause all towers to halt until you either destroy a tower or place an additional Power Plant.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe performance of your towers can be affected by their temperature, with prolonged use resulting in increased heat. However, the placement of Cryogen Refrigerators within the range of towers helps to reduce their temperature, thereby preserving their efficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring gameplay, you may encounter pre-existing structures that require repair to augment your overall electric capacity. Every action in the game generates experience points (XP), allowing you to level up. Leveling up grants you Technology Points, which can be utilized within the technological upgrade tree for your structures. Additionally, \"Times Of War\" features ranks and achievements, providing an additional layer of challenge and accomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEmbark on an exhilarating journey in \"Times Of War\" as you defend against waves of relentless military vehicles, deploy powerful towers, and strategically manage resources to emerge victorious.
