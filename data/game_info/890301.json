Only 5 levels very small game.</p>\n<p>Press W,A,S,D to move. Press Enter next to a console to open it. Type commands in the console to access game object's variables and functions, change them, call them, etc to \"hack\" the game, allowing you to complete levels. Complete a level by cracking the password at the end\u00a0by pressing letters until you bruteforce it. Heal by walking over a wifi station.</p>\n<p>The game is meant to be a sort of puzzle game where you try to figure out what data and functions you have access to and how to use them to disable the turrets and allow you to reach the password console safely. But because 99% of gameplay is typing it feels kind of bad to play imo.</p>\n<p>Here are the solutions to each level if you are stuck\u00a0( Spoilers obviously ):</p>\n<p>Level 1: Easy level, pretty much everything is unlocked so there's a lot of solutions such as \"turrets, 0, data, fireRate/damage, 0\" to set the turret's fire rate or damage to 0 ( obviously repeat with second turret using \"turrets, 1\" instead. You can also use functions such as \"turrets, 0, functions, 0, call\" to make them not target you anymore so you can move up or even \"turrets, 0, functions, 2, switch, 1\" to make the turret call its own damage function instead of shooting.</p>\n<p>Level 2: A little confusing at the start. You spawn next to a moving platform of speed 0. Open the console and type \"moving\" to see the options for the moving wall. I suggest setting the speed, but before that, make sure to set bounceBack to false, else it will bounce back to the start. So, \"moving, data, bounceBack, false, moving, data, speed, 0.5\" then close and move up with it to the password.</p>\n<p>Level 3: You really need to use functions for this one. You have to make the turret on the left shoot the 2 turrets on the right and destroy them. So \"turrets, 0, functions, 0, call\" then \"turrets, 0, data, aimAngle, 0\" so the turret on the left stops targetting the player and start aiming on the 2 others. Then you can walk around the left one.</p>\n<p>Level 4: That one is hard. First, gotta make the 2 vertical walls not bounceback at the end so you can type pass: \"moving, 0, data, bounceBack, false\" and same with \"moving, 1\", then gotta destroy first wall \"moving, 2, functions, 1, call\". 2nd and 3rd wall cannot have destroy called, so you have to do \"moving, 3/4, functions, 0, switch, 1\" to make them call destroy instead of stopmoving, then \"moving, 3/4, data, bounceBack, false\" to make them call stopmoving which is now destroy so they destroy themselves.</p>\n<p>Level 5: Destroy the moving wall, make the left turret ( 2 ) stop targetting player and set aimangle to 0 to shoot others. Also increase damage to save time. \"moving, functions, 1, call\", \"turrets, 2, functions, 0, call\", \"turrets, 2, data, aimAngle, 0\", \"turrets, 2, data, damage, 5\". Then move up and type in console \"system\" to finish the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b223d431a3e36e8289e8126753ac4b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaxMakesGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
