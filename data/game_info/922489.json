It\u2019s an exploration of love, loss, and holiday-tinged grief through a cloudy queer lens.</p>\n<p>This is only a demo version and contains only 1/3rd of what I have planned to add to this game and its story. <strong>loose to</strong><strong>oth. will see its full release in Spring 2023.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Currently at 27k words, full play-through lasts 10-15 minutes\r\n</li><li>Kinetic novel\r\n</li><li>Hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds\r\n</li><li>Is gay &lt;3</li><li>Full release will have one (happy) ending\r\n</li><li>CW: Explicit language, verbal depictions of violence.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Author\u2019s Note: <strong>loose tooth.</strong> was originally conceptualized and briefly worked on for Winter Jam 2022 before unexpected illness forced my hand to shelve it. It has been revived for FFS Jam 2023, if only for a demo. Very appreciative of the motivation this jam gave me to finish something towards the final project, and doubly excited to finally share the beginning of what\u2019s been a passion project in my mind for far too long now.\r\n</p>\n<p>As this is a demo, it\u2019s a little rough around the edges. I am aware of most of the issues I\u2019m releasing this demo with, and am working hard to rectify them all for the full release!\u00a0The only slightly disruptive issue you may encounter is the inability to save as I have not yet reprogrammed my UI. <strong>Thus, I\u00a0strongly suggest playing this game in its entirety in one sitting.</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any other\u00a0relevant feedback or commentary below. &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The copyright for the materials used in \u201c<strong>loose tooth.</strong>\u201d belongs to all artists/creators appropriately credited in the following list.
