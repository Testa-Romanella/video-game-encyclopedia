It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race. A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.</p>\n<p>Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5ca/5ca694fb8b53eaf83fbca29b14c433e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Gremlin Graphics"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
