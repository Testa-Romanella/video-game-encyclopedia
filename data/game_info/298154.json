Once that is done, you can finally travel to the others once you reach 50 population!\r\n</p>\n<p>To travel to another planet, simply click on the travel button and click onto the planet you want to travel to\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0The goal\u00a0of the game is to get the highest population\u00a0 across all planets(you can see it in the upper right corner at all times while playing)\r\n</p>\n<p>The more you travel, the more you increase your population! Pay attention to the asteroids though, since they will start going faster and faster over time!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>- LMB: interact</p>\n<p>- RMB: open menus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:38:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/58114861558ff50dfe70ca34a69c924f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GabrieleVierti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
