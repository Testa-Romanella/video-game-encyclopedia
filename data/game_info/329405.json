Super fast and especially painful on unresponsive touch-displays! A score-attack game with feelings from the 90:s.

Having no experience with solo-development I had to learn alot. I was the intended artist for the project so I had that covered. Not so much anything else. Original Slingshot had a ton more features and was actually a chill explorer type of game in the beginning. Quite the opposite today.</p>\n<p>This version of Slingshot are missing core features such as Leaderboards and Achievements. Would\u00a0 love to get some feedback since I plan to continue with this weird but amazing indie-developer experience. You are also free to donate a coffee of course.
