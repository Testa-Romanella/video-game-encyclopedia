This third beta shows off all of Lizargon's movement mechanics that will be in the final game, along with the general idea I have for the areas and progression for what I want in the\u00a0final game.</p>\n<p>This is the last beta I will put this much effort into, besides the pre-release betas. There will still be more Lizargon betas, but they will most likely be a couple of scenes to experiment with the mechanics added\u00a0without the main menu. This is because making levels that will not even be in the final game takes a pretty long time, and in the end, they go to waste since Lizargon is still under development.</p>\n\n<p>Next up for Lizargon:</p>\n<p>-Tweaks to the movement mechanics (especially the new elemental abilities)</p>\n<p>-Tweaks to how the movement mechanics are programmed to fix bugs</p>\n<p>-Slopes to make the level design more organic and less annoying to traverse</p>\n<p>-The fun part: Lizargon's combat mechanics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T07:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5286b6edc0e71bb209624605425c01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Phoenix Indie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
