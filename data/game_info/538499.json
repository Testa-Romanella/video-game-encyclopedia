Drive 1 of 3\u00a0 vehicle types against an ai, while smashing into zombies for points! One map, but it saves your score so you can save up for the other car.\u00a0Zombies also turn into ragdolls upon contact. I\u00a0was\u00a0learning and wanted to share what I made :), hope you enjoy smashing some Zombies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f367bfdfaf37af9104366d6af85cc97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AGoodPotato"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
