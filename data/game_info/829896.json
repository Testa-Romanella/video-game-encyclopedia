However, you deal more damage when your defense is low so you'll need to find the right balance.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Derek for the music and Deconstructeam for their support.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Note </strong>that this is not a fleshed out game but a prototype we developed to try new things out and help us transitioning from ue4 to ue5, so expect some bugs and rough edges. Despite this, we hope you find it interesting!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T13:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b1b91fd88990e27b181b94dbed629c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Selkie Harbour"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
