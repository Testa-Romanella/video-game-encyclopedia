See the link below:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/globalstartupcitiesgamejam</p>\n<p>Prologue:</p>\n<p>Your society has notice tremendous climate changes on planet earth. And you were sent out, to setup some terraformers before plants, animals and humans are extinguished. Unfortunately, you are not welcomed in a friendly way.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Primary: Gamepad (ideally Xbox controller)<ul><li>ROTATE - Left analogue stick</li><li>LEFT TRIGGER - Move backwards</li><li>RIGHT TRIGGER - Move forward</li></ul></li><li>Secondary:\u00a0 Mouse (required within the main menu)</li><li>Tertiary: Keyboard (some popup menus can also be closed by pressing a button)</li></ul>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul><li>By accelerating your vehicle, you can inflict more damage to buildings. Demolition is mandatory, before the reculturing process can be started.</li></ul>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>The vehicle is not water proofed!</li></ul>\n<p>Others:</p>\n<ul><li>During the gameplay, you will be informed to destroy some specific targets. There is no visual indication in version 1 and 2\u00a0though. Just follow the street up to the hill, destroy most of the buildings on the left and (spoiler alert) destroy the terraformer!</li><li>I did have some trouble when re-baking my lightmaps. If anyone does know, how to get rid of those sprinkles on the ground, please let me now in the comment section. I would also like to know, if someone else can see particle effects or a scenery tinted in red on start. I do not see it when starting the game inside the Unity editor.</li><li>In version 1, you\u00a0will find two executables inside the .zip file. The correct one does not\u00a0have a custom icon. I unintentionally uploaded a primitve\u00a0side project, where I did some research about voice recognition.\u00a0<ul><li>If someone wants to know, \u00a0english phrases can be detected no matter what operating system language you have. But installing an english version, improves the recognition of english phrases. And more importantly, the recognition of english letters! But the delay is still pretty bad and it only works on Windows 10.</li></ul></li><li>If somebody wonders, why I have uploaded video/audio files and a PDF. That's because I had some issues to submit the final presentation. I do hope, that this will not violate any rule.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c8321ef66f2c7561c860bb184987da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ironCookie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
