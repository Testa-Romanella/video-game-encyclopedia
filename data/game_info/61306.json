Nothing could have survived the total collapse of spacetime so it's lucky that it was only a near total collapse. Surrounded by a vast ocean of quantum chronographic static <strong>Planet Dirt</strong> only has a small number of \"stable\" dimensional fragments. These little twisted loops of spacetime are full of dangerous traps, distorted technology, and other memetic manifestations of temporal anxiety but at least existence is remotely possible there.The Twin-Hero PuzzlevaniaRuby &amp; Majesty: Treasure Team follows the adventures of Ruby and Majesty as they search for timeless treasure and fragments of forgotten knowledge in the most bizarre and hostile reaches of <strong>Planet Dirt</strong>. No matter what they face there is always one way forward: <strong>TEAMWORK</strong>!<br/><br/>Solve action based puzzles by coordinating two distinct characters, each with their own capabilities. Ruby the Human and Majesty the Bat must navigate strange environments in search of treasure and the secrets of their world.
