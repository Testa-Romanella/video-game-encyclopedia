I started working on this but I was way too ambitious. I may come back but I'm just gonna upload it. I started working on it in 2019, April, and it kept going and I wasn't even close to being finished. I am going to try other projects, simpler and different genres. I hope someone plays and maybe enjoys it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e13bc00b96549d50955579696d67f79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["JoelNanaKwaku"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
