You've had things handed to you on a silver platter for quite some time, but money is beginning to run tight. During this journey together as a couple, you will find new ways to make money, develop a stronger (Or weaker) relationship together, all while dealing with everyday life that surrounds you. What seemed like a simple task later becomes harder than once thought as you learn more about those that surround you.<br/><br/>This game has a love path and a corruption path. The corruption path contains a heavy focus on fetishes such as sharing, cuckolding, swinging, and optional netorare(AKA ntr, a form of cheating) which can be disabled from the start.<h3>Fall in love...</h3><h3>Or corrupt and share...</h3><h3>Fulfill your deepest fantasies...</h3><h3>And explore your options...</h3><h3>Episode 1 currently includes:</h3><ul><li>Over 1500 high quality renders<br/></li><li>Multiple branching paths<br/></li><li>Plenty of optional content<br/></li><li>An available replay gallery for important scenes ;)<br/></li><li>Over 25 animations with many more to come!<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T06:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6aecd61247805fafbcdc2ae7061888ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Typist"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Typist"], "esrb_rating": null}
