Your main character is a necromancer that gains immortality while he has a unit. Play unstable and very unbalanced cards to make it to the top.\u00a0 <br/></p>\r\nGame Play\r\n<p>Turn based style game play. Drag and drop cards on the units to play those cards. Press the \"end turn\" button to end your turn</p>\n<p> <em>I forgot to and hint text on the Game Over Scene to say that you my press \"SPACE BAR\" to retry.</em></p>\r\nPost Mortem\r\n<p>For this one I really underestimated the underlying workings of a card game and was sure that I'd complete it without a problem. I was wrong. There's a lot that goes into making a card game. This game is pretty far from complete but is playable if you bear with some of it's quirks.</p>\n<p>All negativity put aside, this project is by far the most complete out of all of my games so far. It's proof that I, as a developer/artist, am improving. This being my 3rd game and my 2nd Mini Jam submission makes me joyful. This time I actually got some time to do the art for the game and I'm happy about the way it turned out. With a little more time I'm sure this would have been a very good game.<br/></p>\n<p>I have made huge improvements and I'm grateful that I've come this far. I not very satisfied yet and as such I will be  working hard to improve my game making skills till I reach that level of satisfaction.</p>\n<p><em>To myself: Well done, you're doing great.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7c5d7221580d80b1ae0758119bb66c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ghostrix98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
