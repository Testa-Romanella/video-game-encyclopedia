The theme for the jam was \"roots\".</p>\n\n<p>You are Byleistr, brother of Loki, sent to Nastrond as punishment for a great failure you embark upon a quest to Mimir\u2019s well. Soon your name will be forgotten, erased from the tapestry of time, and unwritten from the annals of history. But it is a choice that you make willingly, and a price you pay gladly. A narrative game about the roots of memory, family, loyalty, and blood. Choose chaos, do the right thing, and become nothing, and no-one as you assist and confront the outcasts you meet along the way. Choose freedom. Choose death. Choose hope. And perhaps, if you are lucky, begin again.</p>\n<p>Note: we recommend playing with full screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba0/ba0ae2eff6705a0165eaaa37d0e5d1e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wolfrug"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
