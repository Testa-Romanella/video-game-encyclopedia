Once you accept a customer (you have to move a little bit to be able to click accept), you have to find him in the city (the app will tell you just the location). After you pick him up, the mini map will show his destination. You have to take him there. The more you drive, the more money you get (2$/km).Be careful to don't drive too much because the customer may get out and he will not give you any money. You can also get fees if you have a car accident or if you injure a person.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day you can choose what to buy with your earned money.</p>\n<p>If you buy alcohol, the next morning you'll be drunk and you'll get a higher fine if you have an accident.</p>\n<p>The game has three days and one final night (with a plot twist).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>*sneak peek from the last night*</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tools:</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\u00a0<br/>Art: Photoshop, Aseprite</p>\n\n<p>Made by @ema1ih (Game Developer) and @culin (Game Art).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d71/d7116ca116410f07e6d3a06efdd1ef75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ema H."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
