You don't know how you get there but you're chosen to not let her out from her prison. Use alien technology (White and Red Orbs) to move yourself quick around the environment. Kju'ytres tentacles will try to toy with you and drag you to water where her fangs will try to devour you.\u00a0Amidst\u00a0the elder gods you are fragile, don't overburden yourself with their teleports. You need to disable all 7 Red Laser Orbs to not let her out. Last one (which is also the first one) will let you finish the game.\u00a0Also when in the water tentacles will not follow you. But be careful you've got no more than 5 seconds before her mouths will devour you.
