Critique is very appreciated!--Team--<p><strong>Nicholas Reynolds(Me)</strong> - Level Designer, AI Programmer</p><p><strong>Jacob Meisenbacher</strong> - Artist</p><p><strong>Charles Heller</strong> - Programmer, Designer</p>--Synopsis--<p>This was the final project for me and my team for the second half of our Game Design course in 2016. We spent the semester going through Norse mythology and creating games that attempt to capture the culture of early Nordic civilizations. But in our final project we were give a significant amount more freedom so instead of sticking to realism we just went with Vikings in space. This was one of the first games I took a heavy programming role for and one of the first games I was involved in that was pretty mechanics heavy. Its basically just a bullet hell shooter set in space as the last remaing citizens of Earth have escaped from the ongoing Ragnarok. But the deities involved in the destruction won't allow them to escape. So you must destroy the dragons terrorizing the space stations in order to live peacefully. Yes, this is very, very stupid and yes, the name is very, very long.</p>--Known Issues--<p>-There is no explicit win state but you can exit the game at any time by pressing Escape and pressing the Quit Game button</p>--Controls--<p>Movement: WASD</p><p>Aim Weapon: Mouse</p><p>Switch Weapon: Scroll Wheel</p><p>Pause Game: Escape</p>--Contact Me--<p>If you have any questions or would like to collaborate feel free to email me at:</p><p>Email: nichoreynolds@gmail.com</p><p>While I don't quite get it just yet, I occassionally tweet at:</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/NichReynolds<br/></p><p>If you would like to check out any postmortems or personal project updates you can find them here at my blog:</p><p>Blog: https://touchmyhapticfeedback.wordpress.com</p>--Credits--<p>Thank you to Sebastian Lague yet again for his great introduction into Object Pooling:</p>\r\nAnd thank you to Sharkbomb Studios for their help with implimenting a loading screen which this game desperately needed:<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a1125820b6105554d2b2929ff21c85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NicholasReynolds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
