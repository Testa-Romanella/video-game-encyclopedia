We would highly appreciate your feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>Note: We did everything from scratch. There were no pre-made assets used.</p>\n<p>Some Context (Spoiler Alert!):\r\nThe world faces Judgement Day. God and Satan are sending their legions over mankind to bring absolut destrucion. In the midst of this battle, you find yourself looking for a place to die. Resigned and disheartened, you wish to send one last prayer to receive closure.</p>\n<p>As the universe will have it you are able to attain divine powers that enable you to fight against the apocalyptic armies. However, those powers take their toll on you, drain your life force and turn it into profit for the supreme deity everything returns to because after all: your life is just a currency. This is displayed in the game by transforming  your lost HP into coins that appear in the UI hourglass at the bottom left of the screen. You lose HP by either getting hit by an enemy or by simply being in the afore described divine form you received upon praying at the altar.</p>\n<p>You have to decide which side you want to fight for and give your life in exchange. You may also beat the game by choosing neither of the two forces and instead remain a human being. Choose your own path.\r\n(This game can be played multiple times with different endings)</p>\n<p>Produced by\r\nKevin B\u00f6nisch (Coding)\r\nMarius B\u00f6nisch (Art &amp; Music) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf9e67d11405fb43a00fcc57d3d3b84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheItCrOw"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
