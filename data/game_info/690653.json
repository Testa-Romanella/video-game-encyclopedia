It's been a weird couple of years, and sometimes you just have to make a game about it.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the 5-years-o-Bitsy jam! The theme was to pick one of the themes from the list, but I have never made a decision in my life.\u00a0 The main theme I picked was <strong>soup</strong>. Also included are: garden, little things add up, reflection, one room, snow, cursed, and earth without humans.</p>\n<p>Bitsy  is a fantastic little engine for making tiny, simple games, and the more I use it the more I like it. I made this game with the help of these tools: Borksy, Pixsy, and Bitsy Savior. <br/></p>\n<p>You can find me on twitter for more soup talk.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597babac191ccc08b5e827668a8b880f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rascal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
