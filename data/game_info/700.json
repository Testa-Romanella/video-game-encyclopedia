{"id": 700, "slug": "lara-croft-go", "name": "Lara Croft GO", "name_original": "Lara Croft GO", "description": "<p>Lara Croft GO is a turn-based isometric puzzle game drawn in material design style. This is the fourth spin-off of the enormous Tomb Raider series.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game ties turn mechanics and adventure game \u2014 even though it sounds contradictory, this merger works. So, the game features usual Tomb Raider gameplay which is: raiding tombs, exploring crypts and fighting multiple enemies. <br />\nDuring forty levels divided into five chapters the player must take turns \u2014 he can go into one of four directions \u2014 left, right, up and down. The time given for turns is unlimited, so it is the move-when-ready type of title.<br />\nGoing through levels namely means learning foes&#39; moving patterns and memorizing the locations of all traps within the level. Lara can climb cliffs and hang down from the ledges to avoid being detected by opponents. The new types of traps and things to avoid are evolving with every next level. <br />\nGO also features \u201clook-for-objects\u201d genre as the player is allowed to collect vases throughout the levels</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The narrative in the title transfers itself via visuals, not dialogues, so it is hard to compose any meaningful story with it. The absence of subsequent storytelling may be explained with the hints mechanics \u2014 it is utterly troublesome to translate a story arc if the help may be requested at any time and level would be over in no time.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2015-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T13:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/664/6641c8e3872da0b3e6a853ad7b6a37b0.jpg", "website": "https://square-enix-games.com/en_EU/games/lara-croft-go", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 115, "owned": 1831, "beaten": 209, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 83, "playing": 18}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 275, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 276, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "Square Enix Montr\u00e9al"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
