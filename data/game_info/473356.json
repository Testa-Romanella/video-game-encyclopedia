This game was created to fit the brief for a project at SAE University Melbourne.</p>\n<p>We were given the brief of taking an already existing arcade cabinet game from 1991 and prior and creating a new game with new mechanics on a mobile device that resembles this old game. We chose the Lucky and Wild driving and shooting co-op game. (Don't tell anyone, but while writing this, I found out the game was from 1992.)</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is similar; the player's take control of a car driving on a road and shoot at targets. Instead of using an arcade steering wheel and light-gun however, the player instead has their phone and their fingers.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Mobile Version:<br/></p>\n<p>Tilt phone left and right to steer the car.</p>\n<p>Tap screen to to destroy car and bullseye targets</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>(Yar) Chestnut Trees (<strong>Yar's</strong> Tree Rework).
