Your ultimate goal is to capture all but one (Can you manage to take them all?) enemy ships.</p>\n<p>Play with a friend in local multiplayer or try your hand at playing agains AI if you feel like challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Every turn player can move on of their units to neighbouring node. White nodes indicate that they are available now. If hostile spacecraft gets touched by your ray when you make your move it will be incorporated in your army to spread the light of ray even further. But moving ships have their shields activated so they can only be capured when standing still. Player wins when their opponent either no longer can sustain the ray between units or when he has no available moves.</p>\n<p>Some of the nodes are occupied by neutral units. Capturing them may help you deafeat your opponent.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Special features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Two difficulty levels of playing against AI - easy and hard.</li><li>Play the game with Tobii Eye Tracker.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Click on one of the nodes to make your move. </li><li>If you play with eye tracker just gaze at your target for a short while.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Development Team:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Jakub Duchniewicz (Celeborth)</li><li>Daniel Lewi\u0144ski (Dante)</li><li>Szymon Pi\u00f3rkowski (szymon112233)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>\n<p>This game was made during Accessibility Game Jam Vol2. Theme of the event was \"Connected Vessels\".\u00a0 Main goal of this event was to make people realize that making very small changes in your game desing can open up your game to people who would not be able to play otherwise. Having that in mind we decided to create game which can be controlled with just one button or an eye tracker.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f23d1a57a68e13cc7da8a8900e0d24d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dante", "szymon112233"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
