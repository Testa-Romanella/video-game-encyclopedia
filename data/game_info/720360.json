{"id": 720360, "slug": "the-silent-kingdom-demo", "name": "The Silent Kingdom - demo", "name_original": "The Silent Kingdom - demo", "description": "<p>The Silent Kingdom is a story-driven, otome RPG made by a single person, where player's choices and interactions with other characters set the narrative.</p>\n<p>This free demo contains the Chapter 0 - Prologue. If you would like to see the full game,\u00a0please support the Kickstarter campaign!</p>\n\n\n<p>Place yourself in the role of Princess Erinys, whose kingdom has fallen under the yoke of a sorrowful curse. In order to save everything you have ever known and loved, you\u2019ll have to stand against the entire world - and even defy the Goddess herself.<br/><br/>How much weight will a withered kingdom burden your soul? As a princess, will you be loved or hated, betrayer or betrayed? Will you seek comfort in the companionship of others, or will the demise of your kingdom seal your heart away forever?<br/><br/>A path of thorns is waiting. The manner in which you walk it is up to you.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li> <strong>A main character that's defined, yet mouldable to your taste.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Princess Erinys is an established protagonist with both a background and a fundamental personality of her own; yet it is ultimately for you to decide just who she is and what she will become in this world. As the player, you\u2019ll be free to choose the way she speaks to and perceives others, decide on her thoughts and emotions regarding various different events, and even select your own preferred name for her if you so wish. Every decision that falls into her hands - large or small - ultimately falls into yours.</p>\n\n<ul><li> <strong>Roleplay experience.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Apart from the most impactful decisions in the story, many dialogue interactions will also contain choices that merely focus on immersion, allowing the player to establish exactly the kind of personality and emotions that they wish to give their princess. There is never any \u201ccorrect\u201d answer when it comes to interacting with others, just different answers.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Romance.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>The princess will have the ability to develop bonds and even romantic relationships with the companion characters she\u2019ll travel with. Although not required in order to see the story to its completion, the relationships you forge with other characters will play a pivotal role in its development. Romances will contain adult, non explicit scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dark and emotional story.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>In this world where every conflict and resolution are bathed in various shades of grey, tragedies and souls stained by corruption arise one after another. Will the princess question her own morality? Will narcissism and lust for power replace faithful bonds to become her most loyal companions? And from what prism will she judge the sins of others?</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Anime style CGs.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>As the story unfolds, many of its scenes will contain event CGs.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>In English and Spanish.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Originally written in European Spanish, the game has been fully translated into English and corrected / rewritten by an English native (thank you, Wolf!). You can choose the language from the options menu.</p>\n\n<p>KICKSTARTER / TWITTER / STEAM<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:11:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/495bb3365319e5afad4deaebd1f37c70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucky Cat Otome"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
