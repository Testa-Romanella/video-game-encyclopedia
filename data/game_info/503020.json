It was completed, from start to finish, in just one week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SudoKuu is a chance &amp; time based, sequence matching, hyper-casual memory game. The game uses Unreal Engine 4.25.3, based on no levels (meaning: pure widget/user interface game), with Blueprint coding only.</p>\n<p><strong>The goal is to memorize the sequence in order, and to relay it under the <em>random </em>timer that the Devil has set up for you! But be aware that it won't be such an easy thing to do, as pesky-little monsters will try to ruin your day!
