Through The Path, it is hoped to rebuild an inner world and take back ownership of a mental sense of Self, finding this <em>psychic somewhere</em>.</p>\n<p>Originally, the game was made to explore the subject of \u201cpsychic nowhere\u201d, describing a state of dissociation, a detachment from the psyche. In other words, the sensation of the False Self having taken over. It\u2019s a condition often thought to be correlated with the absence of a clear geographic belonging or destination.<br/></p>\n<p>(P.S. This is the demo version. If you'd like to help support the final game, consider dropping me a wishlist on\u00a0Steam.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:12:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f99c69cbd90a167c280852d946a59b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jiaquarium"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
