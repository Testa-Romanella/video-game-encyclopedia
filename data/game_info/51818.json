However, you have no idea about what's happening to the planet and if there are any other survivors left. The game is slow paced and peaceful at times, while it could get violent and chaotic when you encounter enemies.<h3>Collect weapons, find ammo and kill anything on your way.</h3><br/><h3>Beautiful yet hostile locations to explore.</h3><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Throw grenades and shoot at explosive barrels to blast zombies.<br/></li><li>Use health kits and food to keep you fit to fight.<br/></li><li>State of the art tech.<br/></li><li>Photorealistic graphics with cinema quality models and textures.<br/></li><li>Realistic real-time lighting.<br/></li><li>Turn off HUD entirely by pressing TAB.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T03:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227815a9f15e5fb4336e3de7ef0d0b03.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Atriagames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 20, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unknown", "Dazzling Divine"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atriagames", "Dazzling Divine"], "esrb_rating": null}
