A distress signal from your home-world marks the end of your scouting mission. Empire is waging war on your people, and so you must navigate your way back to the home-world, fighting the belligerents, looting and finally restoring the peace in the galaxy. Or dying somewhere along the way.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>'Frame: Critical Damage' is a 2.5D roguelike space combat simulation game.

There were many things that were to be added, but had to be cut out due to time constraints. For now, it is a hobby project only bug-fixes and general issues will be the focus of development. </p><p>If any further demand is shown (whether by discussions, donations, coverage), I will be interested in adding many new features and improvements to the game, including but not limited to: more dynamic combat, space phenomena affecting activities, new items and item types, new activities, smarter AI etc. The list goes on and on - there is a lot that could still be done.</p><p>All feedback is appreciated.
