Run the sheriff\u2019s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions \u2013 and try to keep out of prison yourself! \u2013 in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.<br />\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It\u2019s all of these, and more!Dive into one-of-a-kind -story driven experience.Welcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton, The Longest Journey) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John, Duke Nukem), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn\u2019t spiral out of control.<br />\nTake charge of the Sheriff\u2019s department.Your subordinates aren\u2019t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices \u2013 and you&#39;ll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much alcohol? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You\u2019ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.<br />\nEngage in tactical combat.During your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops (or use your drunk and stupid bums \u2013 you don\u2019t always have the luxury of being choosy!). Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment \u2013 if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn\u2019t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.<br />\nBecome a true detective.Collect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects (or use more... forceful methods) and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it&#39;s time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/359/359ed2ec421d8efa3b45f37ccc25a297.jpg", "website": "http://weappy-studio.com/games/this-is-the-police-2/", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 136, "owned": 1339, "beaten": 112, "toplay": 93, "dropped": 82, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 212, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 213, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Handy Games", "Weappy Studio", "Weappy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "Nordic Games", "www.handy-games.com"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
