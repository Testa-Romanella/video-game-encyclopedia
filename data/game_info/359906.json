This gentleman said \u201cWork is for people that don\u2019t play video games!\u201d Steve had been growing tired of the poor treatment he\u2019s received from his young supervisors over the years; toxic people that had no business in leadership roles. When one slip up happens, it all comes crashing down at once and he has to make a decision, one that would change his life! For the best!<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steve\u2019s always had a love for video games, particularly the golden age of arcades! You know the 1970\u2019s \u2013 mid 80\u2019s when the industry was thriving. Steve has a lot of friends in the Classic Arcade Game scene. Many of these people are easy going and all-round interesting; however, you always have a few crazies! For some reason, they\u2019re always just plotting random mischief\u2026 Luckily for Steve, he\u2019s been a bit of a hobbyist since he was a teen. Acquiring and fixing arcades has never been an issue; hopefully, this would aid him in his next chapter of life\u2026 Still though, it won\u2019t be easy!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Please understand this is a rapid prototype demo. I plan to release the full version in the near future. I just love working on the game so much, it's difficult to say exactly when. It also depends on the feedback I receive here.</p>\n<p>Updates to the project can be found at www.squashedbuggames.com/development-log<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T11:00:25", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["squashedbuggames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
