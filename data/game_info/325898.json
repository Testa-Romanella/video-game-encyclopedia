But as long as you'd settle with a funny one, you'll be fine.<br/></p>\n<p>Of course you could say there's no much of a connection here, and you would be right, the main connection established by this game, has occurred between my little brother (who's written the dialogs), and me.<br/></p>\n<p>The background music\u00a0it's an extract of http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR03037 .
