It's more of a playground, than an actual game.</p><p>(A lot of homebuilt platformers used tiles at the time, in order to simplify collision, but I was more interested in the challenge and implemented arbitrary sizes for platforms and so on. No tiles here! :) )</p><p>Doors start working as soon as you have collected all the fruit in a level. Have fun with all the moving platforms, angled slopes and roaming enemies. And don't forget to spawn a few mice on the way. ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a63b6e0a4cf060a20b025860d9a98f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Riccardo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
