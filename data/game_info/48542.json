But with your help he can overcome gravity, turn worlds, and even \u2013 escape!<br />\nSolving the rotating, physics-based puzzles is easy - just use your finger to continuously turn the cell in both directions around our hero. Of course you also have to make clever use of the Freeze! button, which can overcome gravity. Sound simple? It is \u2013 at first...<br />\nFreeze! offers completely new and yet immediately intuitive game mechanics, delightfully gloomy graphics from the internationally renowned pop-up designer and illustrator Jonas Schenk, and a very sinister soundtrack from noted Swiss electronic/trance musician Karl Lukas.<br />\nHighlights of Freeze!<br />\n<em> the first world offers 25 unique and thrilling levels<br />\n</em> there are 15 free bonus levels for evaluation (honest opinions welcome)<br />\n<em> additional worlds can be bought later as an in-app purchase at a very low price.<br />\n</em> use intuitive touch screen control to turn our hero\u2019s cell<br />\n<em> take on lasers, deadly traps, and cruel opponents<br />\n</em> unique style of illustration and collage just looks really good<br />\n<em> wonderful gloomy soundtrack from trance master Karl Lukas<br />\n</em> leaderboards &amp; achievements \u2013 who can escape the prison worlds the fastest?
