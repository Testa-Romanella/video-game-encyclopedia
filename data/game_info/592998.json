Each scene will be set in a different aquatic environment. There is no time limit to rush you through the levels. No Boss fights to fight, XP points to keep track of and no story to progress through. Just explore the areas at your own leisure. It's a relaxing and meditating experience that takes your mind off everyday distractions.<br/><br/>Every scene is carefully constructed so when you zoom out further it gives you fantastical three dimensional isometric art style vibe to the scene.<br/><br/>You play as the diver and will be given a list of objects to find spread throughout the scene. You will be able to control the scuba diver in a 3D world and reach each object by getting close to it and cross it off of the list.<br/><br/>Enjoy the aquatic life with full of swimming fish, colorful reef, plants, rocks set in ocean, lake and river environments.<br/><br/>Featuring original smooth chill soundtrack and simple minimalistic and easy to follow user interface.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T11:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb8763fc29256c9c9888614e5e00b3f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tesondo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
