The stupid llama made us all laugh so much that we decided you might like it too \u2013 so we added lots more art, writing and polish to make it into an actual thing we can actually show to people. We hope you enjoy it! MEDIATONIC. <br/><br/><br/>User Reviews <br/><br/>\u201cI AM VERY STUPID AND USUALLY DON\u2019T KNOW HOW TO PLAY GAMES BUT THIS GAME ONLY HAS ONE BUTTON AND I WAS ABLE TO PRESS IT SUCCESSFULLY ON ONLY MY THIRD TRY. FIVE STARS\u201d \u2013 J. Tanton <br/><br/>\u201cI introduced a llama into the bedroom! It was QUITE something! <br/>...Game? What game?\u201d \u2013 P. Croft <br/><br/>\u201cVery poor. I spent an entire bus ride playing but I couldn\u2019t find a single \u201cinappropriate\u201d time to bring on any llamas. And neither could my grandmother, whose lap I was sat on, naked.\u201d - O.
