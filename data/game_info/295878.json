After dethroning the Ant Queen the Dung Beetles established a socialist government with similarities to Soviet Russia and the DDR. Your part in this is to guide a young dung beetle on his way to enter the Great Communist Party of Insectopia. For this you have to deliver a dungball to the cantina in the main city.\u00a0But this will prove rather difficult because on your way you will encounter many problems which are by no means anyhow related to the system. The gameplay of Shit Society centers around solving physics based puzzles in a 2.5 D perspective by using the dungball and its properties.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus Info:<br/></p>\n<p>Controller is recommended\r\n</p>\n<p>Debug Cheats:\u00a0</p>\n<p>k= brighten game</p>\n<p>l= darken game</p>\n<p>h+r = Reset at last checkpoint</p>\n<p>h+1; h+2; h+3; h+4; h+5; h+6; h+7 = go to checkpoint *number*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb8fbe6f92a100d566f226abcd911a28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["PlayFishy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
