Destroy them. Or they will destroy you. This game is a boss rush game where you must dodge a bullet hell.</p>\r\nA game jam game\r\n<p>This game was made in one month for the\u00a0BOSS RUSH JAM 2023\u00a0by Fartfish. The theme of the jam was \"MAKESHIFT\". The game meets the theme by not having proper weapons, pick anything you find on the ground and throw everything at the bosses! I'm quite happy with this game feature as it makes a good mix with\u00a0the bullet hell genre since you have to move constantly to pick up items to throw.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> or equivalent to move</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> to jump</p>\n<p><strong>Left click</strong> to throw an item</p>\n<p><strong>Hold\u00a0right click</strong> to charge multiple items, release <strong>right click</strong> to throw</p>\n<p><strong>Escape</strong> to quit</p>\r\nMusic attribution\r\n\r\nForgotten Land by Doxent Zsigmond (c) copyright 2014\u00a0\r\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/doxent/45486\u00a0\r\nFt: Gurdonark, Joanne Gabriel\r\nOrc March by Snowflake (c) copyright 2011\u00a0\r\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/snowflake/33465\u00a0\r\nFt: wolfsebastian, spinningmerkaba\r\nOrc March Choir by copperhead (c) copyright 2014\u00a0\r\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/copperhead/45110\u00a0\r\nFt: Snowflake, Wolf Sebastian\r\nNightmares by Donnie Drost (c) copyright 2012\u00a0\r\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/donniedrost/38782\u00a0\r\nFt: snowflake\r\nFalling by Donnie Drost (c) copyright 2017\u00a0<br/>\r\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/donniedrost/55816\u00a0\r\nFt: Zutsuri\r\nLinux and Mac\r\n<p>Linux and Mac versions are totally untested, please contact me if you find any problem with them.
