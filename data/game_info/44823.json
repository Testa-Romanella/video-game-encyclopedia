The ball must end up in the finish area and a player has just a number of moves to do so. Some levels have more moves allowed and some less. That depends on the level difficulty and on the number of obstacles on the way to the goal block.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCombine the moves and plan the line of strike to pass all the levels.
