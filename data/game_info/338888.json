It was run on-site at the June 29th Closing Showcase, where participants bet on which racer they thought would win, and those who guessed the winning character received a button at the end of the night. Real Quiet came in first with a short lead, while Orb, the crowd favorite, came in dead last.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>By Will Lewis.<br/>Thanks to the Portland Indie Game Squad and Summer Slow Jams communities for their support and for playing the game.<br/>Special thanks to Marlowe for support.<br/>Story elements inspired by a rabid thirst for DnD.<br/>All racer names drawn from real-life racehorse names.<br/>#summerslowjams</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a26ccb6f58d34185128f0e9801c6022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gamewill"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
