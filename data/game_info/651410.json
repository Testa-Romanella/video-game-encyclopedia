{"id": 651410, "slug": "fill-it-app", "name": "Fill It App!", "name_original": "Fill It App!", "description": "Starting with the center square, begin to fill in the puzzle grid by switching the color to one of an adjoining square's color. The more squares you fill at each step, the higher your score. But watch out -- you still need to fill the board with a single color before you run out of steps! This is a slight twist to the familiar flood and drench games.<br/><br/>Fill It App! has four levels of scored play: easy (5x5), medium (9x9), hard (17x17) and expert (29x29). Each uses six beautiful colors on the board.<br/><br/>Fill It App! has an additional play mode: Doggos! Choosing the right colors reveals a pic of an adorable doggo -- perfect for kids and animal lovers. And with no score or maximum steps, everybody wins!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T21:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b04fd7a6e8fe8b91d8f25e89989e511d_kyCs9rQ.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Clovis Technologies"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Clovis Technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
