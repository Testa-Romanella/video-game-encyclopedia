This was submitted for the Unexpected Jam, but this is not an unexpected game. It feels like every boss these days is a carrot, and what do we make? A freaking carrot boss. Plus you play as Samurai Bunbun, a bunny, but like, EVERY bunny character these days is a samurai. Totally unoriginal. And let's not even get started on the ending animation....YAWN. Not worth the trouble whatsoever...\u00a0</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, we\u00a0had a lot of fun making this game in about 3 calendar days and hope you enjoy! We have plans for Samurai Bunbun in the future and would love to hear your thoughts about what you'd like to see.\u00a0 We definitely foresee improvements to the UI, as well as\u00a0additional special abilities you can collect throughout a campaign.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keyboard and gamepad controls!
