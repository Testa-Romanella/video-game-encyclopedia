Although the<br/>audience of ZZT games is now far older than the early-teen protagonists of these<br/>titles, I think you can understand the appeal ZZTers had as early-teens in<br/>these sort of power fantasy games that were loosely base on real world settings.</p>\n<p>In \"Wake Up and Save the World\" (henceforth referred to as WUASTW), you play as<br/>Tim, living in the Pacific Northwest and trying to figure out how to alleviate<br/>his boredom and have some fun this weekend. As you'll soon see, he gets way more<br/>than he bargained for!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/574f2dbe3fc91756f8290282ccc3b7b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dr. Dos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
