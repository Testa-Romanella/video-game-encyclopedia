With the ability to temporarily bend time in small areas, you can\u00a0overcome hazards and discover treasure spread throughout the dilapidated castle.<br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD + Space to move around, left click to create wormholes and right click to clear them.</p>\n<p>There are a total of FIVE levels, after which you return to the title screen.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/>Artist: CameraCore (@CameraCore)<br/>Level Designer: Flatflyer (@Flatflyer_) [nsfw twitter warning]<br/>Programmer: rubic (@paradoxrevolver)<br/>Music: SadColor (@fukouiro)<br/>Special thanks to: My brother for giving us the game title within 25 seconds of seeing the game, just like he promised. He only uses Twitch so here's that.</p>\n<p>Our team had a lot to add to this game but there's only so much we could get done in a week. Partial work already exists for level selection, story cutscenes, sound effects, several new game elements and, of course, new levels.\u00a0The results and feedback we get from\u00a0Brackey's Game Jam\u00a02020.2 will definitely help us decide whether or not we want to continue working on Timekeep!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d077d5d8a096c7bf8e2062c782881a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rubic", "Flatflyer", "SadColor", "Camera"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
