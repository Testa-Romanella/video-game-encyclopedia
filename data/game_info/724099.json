The supernatural alien, Vaprak, threatens to defeat our world which is the last planet that stands between him and a dimensional vortex. This vortex leads to a fifth and, up until now, lost dimension. If he succeeds in defeating us, he will destroy our world, opening a gateway for his kind as well as the strange mutating effect that this dimension has on all organic life forms. His forces are far too strong for us to defeat in a frontal attack which is why we must send you to slip past his Omni-eye scanners and make an assassination attempt on the greatest evil that man has ever known. It will take absolutely all of your wits and skill but it is imperative you reach his fortress and send him back to the sulphurous plane from where he came.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIncludes a completely new NES version - built from scratch - that takes advantage of all the NES capabilities - a true technical wonder!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Game purchase includes DOS, SNES, NES and Megadrive versions. You can switch between them in GOG Galaxy. Go to 'Manage Installation' -&gt; 'Configure' -&gt; 'Beta Channels'.
