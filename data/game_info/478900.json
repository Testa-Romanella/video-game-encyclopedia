With this power, no secrets and passageways are hidden from Tic.<br/>With dangers lurking in the continuum, his second ability comes in handy.<br/>His position is only relative, so he can rewind himself to a former position in the vast space to avoid certain death. But it has a catch, Tic has to remember the path he took but to be honest he cannot remember much.<br/>Thus, you as the player have to remember the path when an unforeseen circumstance befalls like the ever-progressing time running out or the boundaries of a mortal fox body being exceeded.</p>\n\n<p>Source Code at:\u00a0Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed2934667086097d7306b00fb7151fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jan222ik", "NotPrepared"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
