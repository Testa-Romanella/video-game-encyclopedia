It could technically take place around the end of Schlo: Final Stand.<br/></p>\n<p>The focus of the game is on the Great Twelve descendants, a special group of humans living with the schlos. With 13 endings and a variety of antics sprinkled into a dating sim setting, the game should be at least a couple hours of fun.</p>\n<p>The music was done by strawberry peeler.</p>\n<p>Trigger warnings: mention of human trafficking, slavery and avoidable violence.<br/><br/>(Note: This could be considered an early release, it's coming out exactly a year after the demo for the last schlo game. There may be some updates coming very soon because it's not totally tested, but for the sake of the numbers, it's being released today.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42b029cb7a3a7ab2bd3b6b688b072805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["krt_org"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
