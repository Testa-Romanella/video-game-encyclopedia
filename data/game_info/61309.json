On your journey you are accompanied by your dog \"Speck\", a German shorthaired pointer. The cabin itself seems to be left in the same condition as your father left it and you find a wide assortment of old strange books. They tell of an ancient legend of a mythological creature which the native people believed to have protected the land. You also find a collection of notes left by your father.<br/><br/>But everything is not what it seems. Determined to find out what drove your father to spend his final months in isolation in the cabin, you set out to investigate.<br/><br/><strong>M\u00c5RD</strong> is a first &amp; third person action/exploration/horror fusion, set in the open-world wilderness of northern Sweden.
