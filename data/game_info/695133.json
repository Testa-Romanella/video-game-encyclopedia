The initial plan was to have a small casino map the player could walk though, and a couple casino games they can play. All graphics and sounds were also created by me.</p>\n<p>Time restraints have made it so that I will probably only be able to have 1-2 slot games available, and possibly the casino map if there is extra.</p>\n<p>I achieved creating a working slot machine that takes bets and pays out based on winning combinations. On the side I also wrote a Python program that allowed me to make the slot probabilities \u00a0close to actual casinos... though my machine pays out more :p</p>\n<p>I may expand the after the jam so it can be what I initially planned depending on if people enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T06:47:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a60752acd8e677dd43830cf74aedecd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thetallwizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
