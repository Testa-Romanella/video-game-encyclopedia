He only started singing to keep up with his childhood friend Shou. When both boys were scouted in high school, they began to drift apart, and Taisei has watched Shou--with a superior voice but weaker stage presence--flounder in his own band. Taisei hates that he has the career his best friend deserves.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSuffocated by the restrictive life of a pop idol he never truly wanted, Taisei tries to reconnect with Shou...only to find that Shou has <em>also</em> changed under the glitz and lights of the stage. Taisei isn't sure what to think of the new Shou--at least, until Shou kisses him.\r\n</p><p>This was released in <em>Sparkler Monthly</em> digital magazine along with a 50-page digital booklet of game art, a script excerpt, and bonus sketches.
