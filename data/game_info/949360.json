In three different levels, the player will experience multiple times of rickrolling. The game begins with a tutorial level teaching the player how to move around. The aim of the first level is to make a trap, and the player is bound to be rickrolled no matter which one they choose, as an experience level to familiarize them with the gameplay. Then followed by another level where the player should arm themselves with a gun to shoot balls of different colors. The player has to shoot different balls to make different sounds, and the sounds are made up of the music of the song <em>Never Gonna Give You Up</em>, and the colors on the cues already tell the player how to shoot. To reach the final exit and clear the levels, the player will have to pass a bridge like the challengers does in the squid game. Players can shoot to identify which is the right way and which is the wrong way. Instead of falling into the void, stepping on the wrong pressure plate will trigger another round of rickroll and go back to the beginning to re-challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a1405e990d1d6077ade52732abe57751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yifan Zhang"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
