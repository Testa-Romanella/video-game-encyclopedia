After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>This is the original version of Zarista Games' Escape from Asteroids Quest expansion with a terrain quite different from the later version and with many different adventures, quests, monsters and items. It's been brought back by popular request and carefully balanced for a starting level of 17.<br/><br/>It's enhanced with new locations for iOS. Enjoy the icy areas of Vapour City, dusty plains, a ravaged city, a splendid waterfall and various dungeons containing new foes.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Elemental\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 17 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion. Please note that after you have traveled to your destination, you'll have no way back for a while (except if you have Marked a spot), so it is also recommended that you keep a save in Mithria.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Elemental Asteroids has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdcce3a3e976d5bd96817b61055439e.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
