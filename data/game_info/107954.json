But first, you'll need some power and workers. Place a generator room down to increase your power cap, it is the first room you can create since it is the only one without a power requirement. To start research, you need to have a laboratory and workers. After you've placed down a laboratory, select it and press the hire button to hire new researchers. There are other rooms that also require you need to hire workers for before they start producing anything. Note that your workers will want an appropriate housing, a dormitory will accommodate 4 workers at a time.</p><p>If you wish to start building rooms on a lower level, select the elevator and press 'add elevator' to activate a new layer.</p>CREDITS<p><strong>Programming </strong>- Lauri H\u00e4rk\u00e4nen, Teemu Gustaffson, Tero Vilmunen</p><p><strong>Art &amp; Animation </strong>- Nino Olla, Ari-Matti Toivonen</p><p><strong>Sound Design </strong>- Ari-Matti Toivonen</p><p><strong>Lead Designer </strong>- Ari-Matti Toivonen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff7e49c148d82512578977e36192219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Wuggy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
