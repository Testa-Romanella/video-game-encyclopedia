We all have weird thoughts when we're on safari.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, the mouse doubles as a measuring device; hold down either the left or right mouse button and drag the cursor to reveal a second cursor underneath - as well as the number of pixels that make up the space between them. How accurate will your measurements of the Boxy Hop-Dog\u00a0be? Whether you're dead on or way, way off, the dimensions change each time you restart the game. It's blocky jungle fun for everyone!</p>\n<p>I initially designed this game around using the mouse and keyboard (space bar to open the entry screen/number keys to input values) but I've since\u00a0gone back in and added a way for it to\u00a0mostly be played with just the mouse, as long as your mouse has a scroll wheel. You will be able to open the entry screen\u00a0 with the middle mouse button and add/subtract values by moving the scroll wheel up or down. Windows' on-screen keyboard also works for any\u00a0keys that need to be pressed!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a38/a383b8354ee838c51d4318a799a87054.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scroungin' 4 Catsup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
