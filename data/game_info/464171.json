A meteor has struck his ship and left his life support and artifical gravity on the fritz! Cross the cluttered cargo hold of your ship while gravity is constantly changing to get to the engines and repair them before you run out of air!</p>\n\n<p>Created for\u00a0GMTK Game Jam 2020, with the theme \"Out of Control\". In this game, gravity is constantly shifting, getting stronger or weaker, or even flipping entirely! Your only mode of movement is jumping, so pay attention to the gravity changes or you might misjudge your distance and end up bouncing back to where you came from!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Space Bar - Charge Jump Power. Release to Jump</li><li>Left/Right Arrow Keys - Aim jump while charging</li><li>Alt - Full Ship View</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e1cfa6f5d766b4747154240fb366793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["digiholic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
