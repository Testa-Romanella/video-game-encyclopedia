{"id": 108944, "slug": "family-road-trip", "name": "Family Road Trip", "name_original": "Family Road Trip", "description": "<p>Family Road Trip (or FaRT) is a roguelike driving game.\u00a0 A cross between Frogger and The Oregon Trail at heart, FaRT is also a cleverly built game of resource management. Pack plenty of food, water, diapers, and a spare tire. Make sure your car is up to the challenge at the auto parts store. Use your resources wisely and aim for the stars. There are several ways to play, and lots of replayable variety mixed in. The game is set to music from the midwest. Download the latest zip or installer version for free. <br/></p>\n<p>The game autosaves at every town. You can save your game by name to play later (saves games do not transfer from version to version), or leave the name blank to play the last game over from the last town when your game ends, so it saves even when you don't tell it to. If you get stuck, you can always go back to the beginning and try again, fresh.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play with a touchscreen (work in progress) a mouse, a keyboard, or a controller.<br/></p>\n<p>FaRT simulates being the driver of a family road trip, but with incentives to make the drive more interesting. Every car you pass instantly earns money, and every wreck costs you money, in addition to the damage to your car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Up and down change lanes. watch out for the other cars, and the edges! Damage will accumulate, making your car slower, and eventually you will break down. It can be fixed with a tune-up at any town, just don't let it get to zero!\u00a0 You can also swipe up and down to change lanes, or scroll with the mouse wheel.<br/></p>\n<p>Left and right change the speed of your vehicle. Upgrade to make your car brake and accelerate faster, make it more maneuverable, raise it's max speed, make it fly, and more. You can also click the left and right mouse buttons to speed up and slow down, or you can swipe right to brake. (Left swipe uses nitro). <br/></p>\n<p>Along the way you will run into garage sale signs and hitchhikers that can have an impact on your trip. Good and bad.<br/></p>\n<p>Different towns in Kansas have special features. Some towns have Thrift stores, with random items for your car for cheaper than anywhere but garage sales. Sometimes a stop in a town will be just a casino, and you will have to choose whether or not to gamble for the things you need.<br/></p>\n<p>When the baby is not fed, it will cry sooner. When it is fed, it will poop. Pull over to the side of the road, or wait till you come to a town (or other stopping points) to change the diaper and/or comfort the baby.<br/></p>\n<p>The volume starts out low. 0 lowers volume. 9 raises the volume.<br/></p>\n<p>\"S\" saves your game. \"L\" loads a game. The buttons under the analog sticks on the controller also work. L3 saves, and R3 loads.<br/></p>\n<p>Tab opens the stereo menu, as does the select button, or just clicking on the stereo.<br/></p>\n<p>Shift, or one of\u00a0the buttons on the controller use your nitro. Also a left swipe.<br/></p>\n<p>Start on the controller, \"P\" on the keyboard, or the middle mouse button pause the game. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62b/62bd8ce74c2c08f5cbd91116c011daf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vaughn Evans"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
