{"id": 218175, "slug": "mtg-probability", "name": "MTG Probability", "name_original": "MTG Probability", "description": "MTG Probability is a simple yet powerful probability calculator for serious Magic: The Gathering and other card game players. See the screenshots for what's possible.<br/><br/>FEATURES AND USAGE<br/><br/>You specify four to eight numbers.<br/> - Total number of cards in your library<br/> - Total number of cards you draw from your library<br/> - Number of specific card A in your library<br/> - Number of specific card A you need to draw<br/>And optionally,<br/> - Number of specific card B in your library<br/> - Number of specific card B you need to draw<br/> - Number of specific card C in your library<br/> - Number of specific card C you need to draw<br/><br/>And MTG Probability immediately shows the probability of drawing needed (or more) numbers of cards A, B and C. You can change those numbers by tapping the -/+ buttons and see how the probability changes accordingly. You\u2019ll find this more convenient than reading tables of numbers.<br/><br/>WHY PROBABILITY IS IMPORTANT<br/><br/>Probability by itself does not directly answer any questions in deck building or game playing. That requires a comprehensive judgement. Rather, knowing the exact probabilities for various situations makes your intuition more accurate and makes you able to make better comprehensive decisions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:50:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874121904f023862b80232b0fc0cc1ff_5B4uAUl.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["TETSUSHI HOSONO"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["TETSUSHI HOSONO"], "esrb_rating": null}
