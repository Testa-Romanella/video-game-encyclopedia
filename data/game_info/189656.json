The more damaged you are the greater your mobility and the stronger your attacks can be. Health pickups become more effective as you deal damage to them, or you can forgo the healing and use them as explosives against the enemy hordes that spawn more rapidly as the game goes on. How long can you last, and how many baddies can you take with you?</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee9a73d90eb936a76429c113e0376005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Great Fantasma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
