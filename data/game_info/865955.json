To escape this fate, you must navigate through a malefic garden patch, towards the family\u2019s truck; and work to stowaway as many Veggies as you can by dawn. But work fast, because there's a chance you might lose your friends, some enemies, or even your roots along the way.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to download and play the\u00a0Early Development Stage of our game and provide feedback via\u00a0our Playtest Feedback Form below!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Specs:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Version #</strong>: v0.1.0</p>\n<p><strong>Average Playtime:</strong>\u00a05 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Available On</strong>: Windows\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment Needed:</strong>\u00a0Keyboard and Mouse/Trackpad</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/XhPGmsRp2KM9WmF38</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T12:01:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b2780fa2379913cffa67c3340447d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fem Formidable"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
