In the prime of your life. You wake up in a mysterious dungeon dimly lit. You have no idea how, where or what you are doing here.<br/>You look around the room trying to find your way out. The only exit, a doorway blocked by a portcullis.<br/>Out of nowhere a mystrious voice speaks to you.<br/>Beat the deities game. Escape the dungeon. Win back your freedom.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is my first ever game jam. I have created a few other little project but never have I released any games I've made nor taken part in any game jam. So I am very exited. If you did enjoy it, please let me know! Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>I have practiced and attempted so many new things in this game. From multiple cutscenes, baked lighting, particles and more. I hope you like it. If you do have any tips to improve my lighting. Please let me know. Its the one area I consider myself to be the weakest in :( <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f0d5bb10f6b1b3f8d11676905ecd43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D3kryption"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
