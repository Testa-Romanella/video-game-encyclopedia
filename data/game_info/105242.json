These tiles are one of 3 colors (green, yellow or blue) and numbered 0-5. Players make matches of 3 or more tiles of the same color and level. When a match is made, a higher level of that colored tile is set where the match occurs. For example, when a player matches three level-1 green tiles, a new level-2 green tile is created. The player obtains a score for every match made. A higher score is rewarded for higher level matches. A new tile is drawn each time one is placed on the board. The game ends when the board is filled and the player does not have any moves left.\r\n\t\r\n</p>Powerups<p>\r\n\tPlayers will have various powerups to use during each game. The Bulldozer allows the player to remove any tile on the board. The Crane allows the player to move a tile on the board to any unoccupied tile. The Star acts as a third tile that allows the player to make a match with 2 tiles of the same color and level.</p>LandmarksMust be placed in the first 8-10 turns.Audio Attribution<p><strong>SFX:</strong></p><ul><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/iut_Paris8/sounds...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/GabrielAraujo/sou...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/John%20Rayson/sou...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/philberts/sounds/...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/ludde44/sounds/17...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/Villen/sounds/149...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/themusicalnomad/s...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/Robinhood76/sound...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundF...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/fins/sounds/17152...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/lebcraftlp/sounds...</li><li>https://www.freesound.org/people/Soughtaftersounds...</li></ul><p><strong>Music:</strong> </p><ul><li>http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music</li><li>\"George Street Shuffle\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/790/7905ab496bd90b2afa2037b3feb92ee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["digitalpossuminc"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
