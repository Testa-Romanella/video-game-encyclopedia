Could've been a year ago (it's what it says), but he created this one shockingly heart breaking pixel-art style comic strip and I've contacted him and asked him if I could make a game based off it. He agreed! Allowing me to use the concept and even the art to go with it. Considering I'm no good at making assets, I've been doing pretty well with what I have now. </p><p>I would show you guys the full comic strip, but there already shows early game spoilers so I wouldn't want to ruin the shock. But worry not, It will be shown in the game.</p><p>What I will do is show you the first panel, and a gif if in game gameplay.</p><p><strong>Pictures and Sample Music</strong><br/></p>The first screenshot is a gif of the gamplay.<p>Here is what I made so far using intensive photo editing to extract everything from the comic which was sorta hard because, yes the artist drew in pixel art... But the aspect ratio was bizzarre, some things (for example the clouds) had un proportioned pixels. I can further explain if that doesn't make sense, it's not the point though.</p><p>Also don't worry about the vignette, it's current purpose is only in early game.</p><p>The second screenshot is the first panel of the comic strip.</p><p>Here are two samples of music I've made using PulseBoy.</p><p>Story of The Hero</p><p>Thirst for Adventure</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Literally what it seems. Basic adorable classic mario jump on platforms, kill enemies... Not being able to scroll left any further than you've scrolled right... Not respawning after dieing... Essentially completing the game in one go, after all. You only have one life.</p><p><strong>That's all Folks</strong></p>Thanks for reading, have a fun time playing my game and enjoy playing everyone elses game! <p>SORRY FOR ALL THE MAC, LINUX, WHAT EVER USERS!!!
