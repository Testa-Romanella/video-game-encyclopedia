Work with a pistol, assault rifle, or sniper to take down dummy targets all over the island. To emulate your favorite FPS games, switch between real-world physics and hit-scan bullet action.<h3>Geography is everything</h3><br/>Shooter's Island features several distinct areas where you can train.<br/><br/>Check out the concrete jungle of a city, the evergreen forest, and the ominous volcano at the center of the island. For a simple trial, maybe start by seeing how well you do in The Pit, a small maze-like structure with dummy enemies around every corner.<h3>Impressed with yourself?</h3><br/>After completing a trial, check your stats on the nearby panel to see how well you performed. Your accuracy and hit count are displayed here, so compete with yourself to see how much you can improve.<br/><br/>Shooter's Island can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses in FPS games, both in VR and other ports.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:07:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7fd8a1a0a0b92a8e7705f14bad43d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seminaut Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seminaut Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
