With a simple click you can water flowers on your floating islands, or send them through the strange portals that seem to grow your flowers faster. Who knows where they lead! Does it matter though? As long as those flowers keep growing, who cares! Use your flowers to unlock new dimensions with new plants to grow, which means more profit.</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\nGardens:\r\n<p>-Start by purchasing your first garden in the upgrade menu located at the bottom left of your screen.</p>\n<p>-Grow your flowers by simply clicking on your garden until enough they've reached their capacity.</p>\n<p>-Once the garden's full, it just needs another click to harvest and profit.</p>\n<p>-Each time you harvest, the flowers are gathered in your tank in the top left.</p>\n<p>-Every time you harvest your flowers, the garden's capacity of flowers it can grow goes up by five.</p>\r\nPortals:\r\n<p>-You can purchase your first portal in the upgrade menu.</p>\n<p>-Once a portal has been purchased, it'll stay on the screen until a garden floats into it.</p>\n<p>-Gardens that go through a portal will grow a large amount when they come out the other side somewhere else on the screen.</p>\n<p>-Each second the portal doesn't have a garden through it, the gravitational pull will grow stronger and reach farther until a garden travels through the portal.</p>\r\nUser Interface:\r\n<p>-In the top left of your screen you can find the flower tank. This is where all the flowers you've harvested go for storage. The number underneath the tank is the current amount of flowers stored in the tank. The blue number inside the tank is your current goal of flowers to store to continue to the next dimension. Holding down left click on the tank will sell the flowers, giving you gold so you can buy upgrades.</p>\n<p>-The upgrade menu can be used to purchase more portals, islands, or increase how much your plants grow with each click. The prices are displayed in white, but if you have enough gold for an upgrade its price will be green. The yellow prices means you have enough resources across your flower tank and your gold. Clicking on an upgrade with a yellow price will auto sell the amount of flowers needed to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>-The gold coin underneath the flower tank is the amount of gold you have at any given time.</p>\n<p>-Players can pause and unpause the game anytime by pressing the Esc key.</p>\n<p>-To exit the game during play, simply press the backspace button and the game will close.</p>\n<p>-At the home screen before starting the game, players have the opportunity to change the resolution of the game by pressing the resolution button.</p>\r\nEvents:\r\n<p>Every so often a random event will start. Currently there are several events in the game:</p>\n<p>-Sporadic asteroids are heading for your garden! Quickly click them before they crash into the garden. If they make contact then your garden will lose half its growing capacity. Keep an eye out though for the illustrious golden asteroid. Some say that it will bless gardens with good fortune...</p>\n<p>-The plant-eating-virus is a dangerous fella. This virus will attack your garden and continually chomp the plants down until there's nothing left. It even spreads to innocent gardens that make contact with the infected garden. The only way to get rid of the virus is to out pace the virus and harvest the flowers, or when there's no plants for the virus to feed on.</p>\n<p>-Clumsy UFO's use your dimension for their hyper space travel. If you click on them, they panic and drop their coins everywhere before zooming off into their pocket dimension.</p>\r\n~Feedback~\r\n<p>Let us know if you enjoyed the game or not!
