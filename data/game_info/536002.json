I made this game in 2020 as a <strong>christmas present</strong> for my girlfriend. The Game doesn't have annoying ads or ingame purchases like the other ones of its kind. You are\u00a0unlocking new themes with the ingame currency <strong>just by playing it</strong>. Feel free to watch my Video about this Project here:</p>\n<p><strong>THE VIDEO WILL SOON BE RELEASED ON MY CHANNEL</strong></p>\n<p>It was originally planned to be a mobile game. But sadly I couldn't figured out how to build it for Android, so I rushed to make a <strong>PC Version</strong>. I will try to port that game to mobile in 2021. You will find the free download here or in the Google App Store.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feel free</strong> to use the Assets I made for the Game for free! You are even allowed to use it commercially, if you are nice enough to ask.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/5989cb91ceefd723ed91f5fcce007221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Desnes Citrus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
