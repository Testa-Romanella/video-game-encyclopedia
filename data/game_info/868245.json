You are the protagonist of one of the many puzzle stories. Each has an initial setting with a brief description and a big goal. From there you have complete freedom of action. Rotate the story cube, direct it in an interesting path and immerse yourself in the created world. In open endless mode make any decision you want and tell the story. The possibilities are endless. Tales are unique and generated on the fly by artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>- HOW DOES AI WORK?<br/>The game is created and controlled by a set of neural networks which generate sequels to stories, combine texts with thousands of paintings by famous artists or generated by neural networks and visualize them, immersing you in the world of art. AI scores your actions and gives you points based on how close you get to the goal.<br/><br/>- AND WHAT WILL GIVE ME?<br/>You relax after a hard day, immersed in your own story, disconnected for a while from the real world and feel complete freedom of action in the colorful worlds you can imagine.<br/><br/>- SO, IS IT SOMETHING LIKE TEXT-BASED RPG?<br/>In a way, yes. Unlike a large number of text quests, in the AI Tales your possibilities are enormous, because stories are generated on the fly by neural networks. You can also relax and play with just a swipe of one hand rotating the story cube. In addition, the plots are visualized with generated images, which create a quite unique and deep atmosphere.<br/><br/>Learn more about our policies here:<br/>Privacy policy: https://aitales.art/policy.html<br/>Terms &amp; Conditions: https://aitales.art/terms.html<br/>End User License Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T22:24:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2687530abcf4d02d55b981f3585abced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dmytro Ishchenko"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Dmytro Ishchenko"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
