You play as ZipZop, a less than stellar detective who's current case is to solve the mystery of the missing Topaz Scorpion. No matter what's going on, ZipZop knows exactly where to go to find clues. And it's his favorite bar. Every time. The Worm Hole was originally a tackle shop for space fisherman, but now the fish just go there to get the bait at the cost of money rather than their lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Be warned, it isn't really complete or coherent, but it's our first jam and I'm pretty proud of it nonetheless. Thanks to my team for helping make this a great experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d534c0c7523d22c02172a161f1fbe11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["impostrophe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
