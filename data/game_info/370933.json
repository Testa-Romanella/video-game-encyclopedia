Well....<br/>1- Play it on full screen. For some reason, the resolution is just bad, sorry :'c<br/>2- If you die, please reload the game HAHAHAHHAHA, so sorry.<br/><br/>This is a not finished game, not as I wanted, I had some many plans for this, but this is my first game and my first game jam, I have learnt a lot on those days. Yeah, I know,  there is no music.
