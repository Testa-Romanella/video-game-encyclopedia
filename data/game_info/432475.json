The game is a remake of Rayman M for the PlayStation, but only features the racing half of the game. The Teensies were replaced with a new character (Globette), sports conversions of twelve race tracks (the level Treasure Ship was removed and replaced with Canopy) and a slightly edited introduction movie. The game only supports up to two players, due to the PlayStation&#39;s hardware limitations.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "2002-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T19:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc81a94b8fb3458129346378ef05caf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Ubi Soft Shanghai"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
