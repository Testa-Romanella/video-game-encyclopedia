Classico put on an enchanted hat a couple years back and... There was a trade-off. You were granted better agility and a smashing somersault attack. But, If the hat comes off, Classico get very sick until he passes out. After about a week he will die. Drippy is a power hungry skeleton who has waterbending skills and\u00a0\u00a0wants artifacts and relics. (Credit to Jayden J. for creating him!) Drippy has been sending fleet to thwart Classico and will keep at it\u00a0until he can get that hat! This has been happening for a while and well, Classico has had enough! So he has set out on a journey to teach that skeleton a lesson.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T11:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1ae7cc8418aeccb3415e6ebb46a97e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drewcrew animations"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
