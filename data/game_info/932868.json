Wander through several disjointed locales\u00a0as you gain powers, encounter strange entities, and piece together a despondent story.</p>\n<p>This free demo includes one of the many areas you can explore throughout the game, but is not perfectly\u00a0reflective of the full experience. As a result, you may encounter bugs while playing. If you do, please leave a comment describing what happened, and I will try to fix it in the full release.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this demo and\u00a0would like to support the development of this game, please consider donating.
