It is  text based infinite runner style game. The challenge comes not from timing as is typical in this oversaturated genre, but from keeping track of how much energy you expend and attempting to maximise you're money intake.</p><p>The current version is a demo/beta release and was made in a week. It ends after you reach 100 distance. Unfortunately I recently lost all the source files for this game and will be unable to continue development.</p><p>Follow me on itch, or twitter @Bourbonbrick, or even Tumblr, and don't forget that \"Support This Game\" button, any donations would be really appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4ff108d8089a6eecae646a948e3e907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Breog\u00e1n Hackett"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
