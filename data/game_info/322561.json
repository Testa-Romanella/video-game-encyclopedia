So you should rotate the pipes in the right direction before the liquid is spilled. <br/><br/>Get all three stars! <br/>In the new game mode we placed the stars on the field. <br/>There are several right routes! <br/>Using the easier routes you cannot get all the stars but if you are quick and adept enough you can get all three! <br/>(we\u2019ve come up with three stars on all areas :) ) <br/><br/>Choose your level of difficulty! <br/>There are three levels of difficulty in the game. In case you find the \u2018Easy\u2019 areas too effortless then select the \u2018Medium\u2019 or \u2018Hard\u2019 ones. You don\u2019t need to go through all the easy areas because all the levels of difficulty are available at the beginning of the game. <br/><br/>Features: <br/>- new, exciting gameplay, new rules <br/>- 60 areas <br/>- 3 levels of difficulty<br/>- zoom", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/8637bade71587f9bbe42700f9e1972ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Navigation-Info Kft."], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Navigation-Info Kft."], "esrb_rating": null}
