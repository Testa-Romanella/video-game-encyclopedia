Menus aren't great and keybinds are atrocious. We spent quite some time on environments and mood though.</p>\n<p>We added a lot of mechanics that could be interesting in a full game. You can upgrade your stats, use objects, throw fireballs, cast a force field, etc. It sounds overwhelming but you won't have to use everything. Just experiment with what's appealing to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Press [RB] or [D] to bring up a quick manual during the game.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985130b2b572604980d1cadf725b3670.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aur\u00e9lien Dos Santos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
