You have found a previously unknown ruin - or so it seems. Apparently this was prophesised to be found in the current year and contains a cure!!! The walls have some inscriptions written on them in an unknown language and script. A linguist who went ahead of you has given you the transcription of the first inscription - \"<strong>SPEAK WORDS</strong>\". You'll have to transcribe the rest of the scribbles on the wall in order to gain entry. He just said \"<strong>TAKE CARE</strong>\" and ran away. Why? Oh well.<br/></p>\n<strong>How To Play:<br/>* WASD / Arrow keys to move<br/>* E to interact with inscriptions<br/>* All keys to type in your transcription<br/>* Enter to submit transcription<br/>* Escape to stop reading/transcribing<br/>* Keep some paper handy - you might need to take down notes (or try to remember the shapes for the letters. Up to you :P ).</strong>\r\nExtra Credits Jam #6 challenges-\r\n<p><strong>Extra Translation</strong> : The game contains a conlang (sort of) and a new script that the player must decipher to proceed.<br/><strong>Extra Retro</strong> : The game uses only colors from CGA palette 0<strong><em>.\u00a0</em></strong>This took most of my development time. Totally worth it though imo - learned a lot.<br/></p>\n\n<em>Game made for the Kenney Jam 2020 (48 hours) and the Extra Credits Game Jam #6 (72 hours)</em>. <em>Started after the EC Jam theme was announced so actually less than 48 hours.
