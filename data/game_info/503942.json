Now the entire laboratory is stuck in a time loop, constantly reversing time to just after the earthquake! Can you make it out the laboratory before the entire thing comes crashing down on your head, and can you save all the survivors trapped around the facility? Death certainly isn't a problem!</p>\n<p>A topdown puzzle game where you must find the exit and escape. This game is pretty difficult and requires the player to die multiple times in order to gather enough information to make their escape. Information gathered in a life will be kept over death and is viewable in the log, so die as much as you need!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/743e5db33e0a1f0eb6fcbdaff85dfcf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JaGTeK Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
