Your time will show up when you win (or lose) the game.</p>\n<p>Feel free to post your winning (or losing) time in the comment section!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Goal of this game is to dig up and sell ancient egypt relics as and archeologist. There are three other archeologists and you can steal the relic they digged up. They also can steal from you. When you or any other archeologist sell relics worth of $1000 the game ends. As a result you get... well, end screen... and timer.</p>\n<p>WARNING:</p>\n<p>Playing in browser  may lead the audio to delay and I recomend to download it for better experience.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Music: https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/25563/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T07:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12ef68807c986df8eb0d0d3098ff052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Chamrdoid"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
