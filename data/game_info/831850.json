You are on a huge playground where you can be as creative as you want. Build a small tower or, if that's too boring for you, create thousands of cubes and let them all fly through the air. But be careful not to catapult yourself into the sky.<h3>tools</h3>Use your \"tools\" to create new cubes, to move cubes, to fling cubes, to fling the player or just to wreak havoc.<h3>buttons</h3>Spread across your playground are large, red, glowing buttons just waiting to be pressed.<h3>physics</h3>Almost everything in this game can be moved, and when things can be moved, chaos is not far behind.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T05:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5b8cb7dd4ac58b222dd532929abbdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Partygamer3000"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Partygamer3000"], "esrb_rating": null}
