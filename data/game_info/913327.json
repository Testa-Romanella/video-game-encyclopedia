Whenever you answer a question you get points! Or rather crystals.<br/>Get enough crystals and maybe you win something!\u00a0But there is another thing. This is very important and I don't want to make you nervous..<br/>but if you can't answer them you die.</p>\n<p>This game was made by me in the context of an assignment for my studies. Everything was made in five days, not because that was a requirement, but because I'm good at procrastinating. There are still a few things that could be tuned but overall its a complete game. It may not have the deepest mechanics but it was made with love.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing the game and if you have any feedback I would love to hear it.</p>\n<p>-SyntecTK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7d/e7d97a2c26c4e7c7d8fcfb65a74a6d59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SyntecTK"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
