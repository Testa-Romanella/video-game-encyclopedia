I don't have time to fix that for the jams deadline, but expect an update soon to fix it. It shouldn't detract from the game itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is currently no feature to save the game, or to speed up text. This should be included in the next update.\u00a0This is not a particularly long VN, so I hope you can enjoy it without that.</p>\n<p>There is no main menu. When you start the game, you start the game! This will be fixed in the update.</p>\n<p>Options to change text speed and size will be added in a future update.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please leave comments and questions down below!
