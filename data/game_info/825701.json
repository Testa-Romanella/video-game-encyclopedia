It's a short experience - maybe five to ten minutes - with unlimited lives and frequent checkpointing. The goal wasn't to make something super challenging, but to make a concise, playful experience. It can be broken pretty easily with advanced Mario techniques like walljumping.</p>\n<p>This rom hack was made in I think about one week using SMB Util. Leon Arnott added some additional features, like checkpointing, and removed unnecessary ones, like the time limit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T07:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a4/9a4c72f84c97b23e99da17eb2de1cbcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anna anthropy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
