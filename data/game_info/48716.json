{"id": 48716, "slug": "cavesweeper", "name": "Cavesweeper", "name_original": "Cavesweeper", "description": "Delve deep into this dangerous dungeon, battling deadly monsters and discovering epic loot. Cavesweeper is a unique roguelike puzzle game that is easy to play but difficult to master. No two playthroughs will ever be the same in this addictive, infinitely replayable RPG puzzler! For the competitive players, leaderboards exist - can you make it to the top and stay there? Includes 40 in-game quests, with corresponding Steam achievements!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe puzzle battle gameplay works as follows: each of the 25 tiles on the field is a certain color. When you correctly reveal a tile, a number will be displayed inside that tile. This number tells you how many of the 4 surrounding tiles (North, South, East, and West - NO DIAGONALS!) are that same color. When you incorrectly guess a tile, you will be hit by the monster you're currently battling. Different monsters have different properties, effects, and so on. Throughout the dungeon you will find equipment which will aid you in battle, for example by allowing you to regenerate hit points or have armor to reduce the damage you take from enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConveniently, the game auto-saves after each battle. You can exit out of the application and resume later. If you enjoy Picross, Sudoku, or Minesweeper, you will love this game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdb/fdbf5d3f0b5712e3502a61deb6acb875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Quikding Game Soft", "Stylus Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Stylus Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
