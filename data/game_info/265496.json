{"id": 265496, "slug": "the-haunting", "name": "The Haunting (itch)", "name_original": "The Haunting (itch)", "description": "<p>Hey there folks, just another Epic Megajam entry here! The premise of the game is to exorcise whatever presence is infesting a haunted house with\u00a0 your\u00a0 trusty bag of salt! However, you can only exorcise items directly possessed by this influence, which is otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Thankfully, you have a mirror which lets you see this influence and thus determine which items to purify! You do have to be quick though, the presence won't let you get off easily.</p>\n<p>With the game description out of the way, may as well describe the team and development! We were team of four who wanted to get some hands on experience with Unreal, and what better time to do that than the Epic Megajam? There were a LOT of road blocks\u00a0 which prevented this project from being properly completed within the time limit, most of which resulted from inexperience, and the rest just being poor circumstance for some team members (including our repo ceasing to function for EVERYONE, thus leaving one member to complete the rest of the game in one day). However, the game works for the most part, if a little rough around the edges and lacking a lot of textures and sounds. That said, I'm pretty happy with what we've got done here! Hopefully you'll get some enjoyment out of it too!</p>\n<p>The Team:</p>\n<p>- Me! - Programmer</p>\n<p>- Josh (https://theaioliguy.itch.io/) - Programmer</p>\n<p>- Nicky - 3D Modeler\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Tyler - Game Designer, Sound Designer</p>\n\n<p>PS: There were a lot of\u00a0 starter assets used in this project, mostly textures and materials, with the occasional model used as well. I'll go through and list them all in the morning, but for now I really need some sleep!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8dbd88505bbc1b02beb89eb797894445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swagdorf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
