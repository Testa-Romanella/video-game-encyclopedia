Well, this is an essential. We have bad pixel art, bad gameplay, and no story to talk of, but we do have some nice fonts.</p>\n<p>The game's story is of the Jack of Hearts, protecting the King of Hearts from the other suits. There are 3 modes, and 4 difficulties to try, with new enemies as you get more intense. There is also a semi-working leaderboard system, but don't count on it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking this out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/902/902b7fcd5887c06fb647820f335597ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AbandonedUberDriver"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
