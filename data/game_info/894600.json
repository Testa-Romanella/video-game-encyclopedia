Forge the legend of Baba Yaga and live out its origins in BLACKTAIL, a one-of-a-kind blend of intense archery combat, magic and dark storytelling set in a vibrant fairy tale world.<br/>\nPlay as Yaga, a 16-year-old girl accused of witchcraft and expelled from a medieval Slavic settlement. When living memories of your past return as foul, walking spirits, you are left with no other option than to hunt them down in hopes of unravelling your own mystery.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts Original Soundtrack<br/>\n<br/>\nGet carried away by BLACKTAIL\u2019s Original Soundtrack. A combination of dreamlike, Slavic themes with modern motifs and synthetic sounds reflects contrast and duality - the foundation of BLACKTAIL's vibrant world.<br/>\nThe score composed by Arkadiusz Reikowski, with performances by Robot Koch, Zazula Vocal Group, Bartosz Pa\u0142yga, and CZELUSC Collective follows Yaga\u2019s highs and lows, from the game\u2019s sunniest meadows to its darkest depths. It sets the emotional backdrop for a dark fairy-tale like no other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAvailable in MP3, FLAC and WAV formats.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T12:12:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4f74c02e5e44dcca2ca543be4b0df6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THE PARASIGHT"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Focus Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
