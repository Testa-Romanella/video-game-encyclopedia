So I chose pong and added power ups. It can be played with 2 people with player one using w and s and player 2 using up and down arrows. I originally was using music from my friends band From Ashes to New, but did not have consent from them to use it as they never got back to me, so I removed it. But this game was well liked by the class even if the score sometimes did not load or did not count correctly. I am not a coder and this was my best attempt.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c401ebd343aae96279e6fec550d24e81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nick Grammatico"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
