That's when everything changed. Before that, they were just a distant wonder. A miraculously odd telescope reading or a blip in the noise.<br/><br/>But as we were watching them... They were also watching us. And when they came for us, we all watched them together. I mean, all of us. The whole planet. They appeared above us, destroyed our defenses. And we knew we were doomed.<br/><br/>We left us with no other choice! We had to abandon Earth. Our last transport ship, 'the Trabalt,' was our only hope. But was this small, salvaged vessel enough to get us off Earth? To take us out into the unwelcoming galaxy? To find new footholds for the human race?<br/><br/>They may have taken our world. But we still have our wits. And our ingenuity. And our will to fight!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Gluon is a combat, survival and exploration game with space battles featuring massive numbers of ships.<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Gather resources!</strong><br/>Your journey is full of dangers. You must prepare yourself for any eventuality. <br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Expand your ship!</strong><br/>Your ship is modular and expandable. She starts out small but over the course of your journey, you will expand it into a massive capital ship. You must optimize her layout and build the perfect fortress for your civilian charges.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Raise strong crew!</strong><br/>Hire and manage a crew of officers. Maintain high morale levels to keep them operating at their best.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Build defense systems and protect your people</strong><br/>Research and build technologies to protect your ship from the many threats of the galaxy. Build fixed weapon systems on the Trabalt, or construct a fleet of fighters to keep her safe.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Explore a massive galaxy</strong><br/>Find your way through a galaxy of mysteries and wonder. We left Earth not knowing where this path would take us. Surely there must be a home for us out there, somewhere?<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Protect your people</strong><br/>You are responsible for the last remaining humans, cast adrift by cruel fate.</li></ul><br/>We are all refugees, now. The emptiness of space is our sea, our destination unknown. Our fate is in your hands. Good luck, Commander.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Gluon is the medium for strong force and it exists in very small scale world like the proton and the neutron. It is the biggest force among the four fundamental interactions of nature, three others are electromagnetism, weak force and gravitation.<br/><br/>In the future, the new technology is developed. This technology allows us to apply gluons in the huge scale world to combine objects we can see in real life. It has wide application in space engineering and became the essential technology for constructing modular ships.<br/><br/>You can see the small gaps between modules, this is the area where gluons act.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>'Fastbird Dev Studio' is a new independent game development studio located in the island paradise of Jeju, South Korea. We also develop an open source game engine called 'Fastbird Engine'. Gluon is the first game built with this engine. The engine is available for all people without any fee.
