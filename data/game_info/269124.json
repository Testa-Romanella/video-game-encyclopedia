Both you and a friend will choose a character from those that the players have dreamed up. Then, strap in while you are dropped head first into adventure while the DM tries to keep all of his players happy in a futile attempt to let everyone play just the way that they want. This will lead to thrilling adventures in lamp-lit medieval cities, dark dungeons, the much-hated water level, and even Hell itself. As you progress, you will find many villains that are unique to each level, solve platforming puzzles and finally fight the DM himself as he tries to kill off the player characters. Yet with each character armed with their own set of unique primary attacks, secondary attacks, and the mighty special, you may just stay alive long enough to fight back against his people-pleasing mania. All while being entertained by players in-game who are just as much fun about modern winks as you and your friends are if you were to sit down and play.</p>\n<p>controls:<br/>W - jump<br/>A&amp;D - left &amp; right<br/>Q - secondary<br/>E - primary<br/>F - actions (opening doors)<br/>R - ultimate</p>\n<p>Left stick - left &amp; right<br/>A - jump<br/>X - actions (open doors)<br/>right trigger - primary<br/>left trigger - secondary<br/>right&amp;left bumpers - ul</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418b506acb01772bdd12df926dc3be2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baneofwar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
