I've tried making customisation as easy as possible (download the source code and you can modify the constants), so that you can make this demo look completely different, and you can even add new levels if you like!</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>You can sometimes get stuck on walls. However, you can get out.</li><li>On the first time running the game, the game will show you the default font in the menu instead of the Roboto font. You can fix this by reloading.</li></ul>\n<p>Other than that, enjoy the game, and try to get a better time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T22:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a507b4b8c36e649d5cbeac5a00b766d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arnav K"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
