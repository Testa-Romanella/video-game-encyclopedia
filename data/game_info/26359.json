Be careful not to let time run out!<br/>Nintendo first began \n      releasing the Game &amp; Watch series in 1980. This collection of games was \n      available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a game and a \n      clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: GAME A \n      (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some controls \n      have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi \n      system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Memorize the order in which flags are raised, then raise them in the \n      same order (GAME A) or raise the correct flag according to the \n      corresponding number (GAME B). Earn one point each time you raise the \n      correct flag, but lose one of your remaining tries if you raise a flag \n      out of order or if you let the time bar run out. The game ends when you \n      have no tries left.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0a92a4282878a698f50cfaaca54b11b.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/gameandwatch/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
