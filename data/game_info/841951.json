Something about it is \u2026 Different. Something is not right. It is a sound that is only wolf-adjacent. A call from the dark produced by the vocal cords of an entity belonging to neither the realms of man nor God.\r\n</p>\n<p>For some time now, it\u2019s followed you day and night. In the dark it grows louder and certainly seems closer than ever. The sound rattles the bones and reminds you of an ever present danger, interrupting sleep and meditation. It is the third day that you\u2019ve traveled without rest and here deep within the woods, you are no longer sure what the time is or even where you are. Your last memories of the sun seem so distant and the light of your torches are slowly starting to fail.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTo your present relief, you have come across an old house nestled within a copse and inside the dim glow of lamplight brings the faintest hope of rest. The soil here, wet and soft, pulls at your boots with every step that brings you closer and the feeling of something bearing down upon you from the shadows between the trees has only become more immediate.\"<br/></p>\n<p>The Thorn and Broom is a short 2 to 3 hour module ready for your Dungeons and Dragons party of level 3. This module best serves a party of 3 or 4. \u00a0Inside you can expect eldritch terror, an unrelenting danger, and a story brought to completion by your players.</p>\n<p>Content Warnings for this module include: eye-touching, possible Ommetaphobia triggers like the appearance of eyes in the dark and/or being watched, insects, abominations, implications of patricide.<br/></p>\n<p>25 pages in total, expect influences from Resident Evil and H.P. Lovecraft<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/1239f84a72334193f587a894169f8b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KintaroTPC"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
