Shoot, dodge, and even catch bullets, but remember: You only have one.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>One Bullet </em>is perfect for those who love high octane, non-stop, chaotic action.\u00a0 You and another player are pitted against each other in a duel to the death, but\u2026 Both of you only have <em>one bullet</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>Bullets bounce and ricochet from wall to wall, platform to platform until they either meet their mark or you catch them.\u00a0 Catching bullets is the only way to reload, and the only way\u00a0to <em>survive</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>One Bullet </em>is a 2-Player game. It does <strong>not </strong>support single player.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Map 1 - Yellow is the standard map. Map 2 - Green has the jump height cranked hysterically high.
