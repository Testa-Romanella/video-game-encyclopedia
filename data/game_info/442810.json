Their chests were punctured and the blood completely drained. Few months later, a woman claimed to have seen a strange creature near an area where more than 150 animals had been killed.<br/>Twenty years ago, similar deaths had been attributed to a local Satanic cult, but there were reports of other incidents across the island.</p>\n<p>Mysterious animal deaths continued to be reported in several countries in America. The newspapers named the creature \"El Chupacabra\" (the goat-sucker).<br/>In-depth investigations claimed that there was no conclusive evidence of blood drainage in the bodies, also pointing out similarities between the creature described in the sightings and a monster from an sci-fi film released at the time.</p>\n<p>However, many people accuse the authorities of covering up the truth about El Chupacabra. A farmer and his family reportedly disappeared after his home was invaded by a group of creatures that would have escaped from a military base.<br/>To date, no official explanation has been given. Witnesses altered their versions and documents linked to the case were lost in a fire.</p>\n<p>A low-budget film and some computer games were produced in order to discredit future revelations.\"</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS<br/>Arrows / D-pad = Move<br/>Z / Button B = Shot / Attack<br/>Enter / Start button = Confirm / Pause<br/></p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE<br/>Kill the Chupacabras before them eat you or your family<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/67585e08fda8e0d153e58e0e093b384e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Alex FC", "Dotto Meister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
