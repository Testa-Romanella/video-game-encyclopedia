Correct answer, disarms the landmine, wrong answer explodes the landmine.</p>\n<p>Use the numbers around the player to figure out where landmines are located.</p>\n<p>The math questions become more difficult the higher the difficulty level you choose.</p>\n<p>The speed for choosing the correct answer to the mathematics question also changes at the different levels of difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f19c6db267420cd3fe8c8da6a017f250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["codecat.se"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
