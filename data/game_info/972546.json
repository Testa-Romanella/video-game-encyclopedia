In Monkey Game you have to jump on platforms and fight enemy monkeys ,explore levels, find secrets, complete stages, defeat bosses and collect achievements. There are no checkpoints so dying sends you back to the start, once you've completed a level it will save and you can start from the beginning of that stage. Monkey Game might look silly but it can be very challenging with very hard jumps and bosses stopping you from completing the stage. Some bosses have fighting patterns that can be learnt to make your next attempts easier.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-24T05:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/308faf3810f73d5164fd22ddb6e7417b.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/monkeygamegood/home?authuser=0", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlphaDucky"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["AlphaDucky"], "esrb_rating": null}
