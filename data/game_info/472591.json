{"id": 472591, "slug": "souls-war", "name": "Soul's war", "name_original": "Soul's war", "description": "<p>Plato proposed that the soul consists of three parts: \"reason, passion and desire\". It is difficult for reason and desire to be completely balanced. They are opposite to each other. Passion, as the third party between reason and desire, can be assimilated by any party. As soul editors, players have the ability to change individual souls. They can challenge each other's world on behalf of any camp, and help themselves fight by assimilating the middle party. In a fierce battle, the ratio of the number of souls killed to the number of assimilated souls will affect the final soul attributes. Do you prefer desire or reason? What kind of soul will you create?</p><p>\u00a0Our game vividly shows the game of these three forces in people's daily life by visualizing the \"soul\". We envision the future soul synthesis technology, which enables players to reflect on their thinking or decision-making process and the impact on the results through the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1dc28a9d2d714c537ee21aa37a658dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yuxia.ren17"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
