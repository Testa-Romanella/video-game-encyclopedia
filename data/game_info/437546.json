One of those games is\u00a0Ghost Town, a puzzle-adventure game created with GB Studio.\u00a0Although I'm excited to show off the game, I must note that\u00a0it's still in development! So, with that said,\u00a0today I present to you a demo of Ghost Town for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This demo includes the first act of the game, with a runtime of approximately 45-60 minutes. If you would like to follow the development of the game, you can find me on Twitter. Feel free to say hi.</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Ghost Town can be played with either the arrow keys or WASD. The full controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> or\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong>: Move</li><li><strong>Z</strong> or <strong>J</strong>: Select / Interact</li><li><strong>X</strong> or <strong>K</strong>: Back</li><li><strong>Enter</strong>: Start</li><li><strong>Tab</strong>: Toggle Fullscreen</li></ul>\n\r\nNotice\r\n<p>Ghost Town is purely a hobby\u00a0project, and is not an officially licensed title for any handheld/home\u00a0console. This game is made with love and out of admiration\u00a0of the classic consoles and games\u00a0of my childhood. Also, this build of the game uses nw.js to run as a self-contained\u00a0executable, hence the somewhat large file size. I will work to reduce this bloat in future releases. With that said,\u00a0enjoy the game, and thanks for checking it\u00a0out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e99712e2c9a744a3a19b1e4af5293d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["yomiparis"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
