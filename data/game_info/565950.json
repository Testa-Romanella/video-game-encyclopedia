Basically everything about this project is new territory for me and I spent a lot of the 5 days just picking up the basics of Unity and Hexels. I know this game is kind of basic looking, and the mob spawner is suddenly broke, and the resolution isn't scaling right when you play in WebGL, and there's no music or sound effects, and the rigid body on the fountain makes shooting from on side of the screen to the other impossible, but I'm still proud of what I was able to accomplish from zero in these five days and truly believe if I could start over, this game would be much better.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Ansimuz for some FX that I didn't have time to redraw</p>\n<p>Brackeys for all the tutorials</p>\n<p>The kind folk in the LM0B discord who helped me through several problems<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T07:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32cdf5217f105f802569eb089f99c42e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SClub7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
