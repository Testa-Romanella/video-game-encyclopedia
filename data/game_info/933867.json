Expect that there might be some bugs in places.</strong></p>\n<p>As the bell tolls for the Felled Lordess, she is brought to a cave to be executed, She is rescued and from then on sets her eyes on taking the throne she once had back from the clutches of the new owner. Take control of the Felled\u00a0Lordess, tell her story your way, and either take down or join the King that had wronged you. It's your choice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Almost every choice effects the story!<br/></em></strong>Even from small choices to build rapport with allies to unlock scenes with them!\u00a0(hopefully, I'm still trying to implement it) <br/><br/><strong>Choose which side you're on!</strong><br/>Will you take back the throne or succumb to the humans? (These will effect what skills you collect in the game too)<br/><strong>NOTE: Side Missions CAN have an impact!</strong><br/><br/><strong>5 Main Characters!<br/></strong>(Only 3 currently available in the current beta)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T13:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b803c515588c0f47f5593b17aee88dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaitoDoesStreams"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
