The longer you survive, the more difficult it gets, but, to turn the tide in your favour slightly, more powerful and exotic weapons will spawn. Progress from handguns and shotguns to rocket launchers, lasers, flamethrowers and chainsaws.</p><p>Controls, how to play, etc. can all be found from the main menu. All programming, art and design was done by me, with music courtesy of Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com/) and sound from https://www.freesound.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fbfd82f2da6a3f92dd6c7ee312f913a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conor O'Donovan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
