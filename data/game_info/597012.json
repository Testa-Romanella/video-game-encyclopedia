Beware of the purple monsters, and try to collect the sparkly green things.<br/></p>\n<p>The controls are abominable.. Basically, you lean in the direction of the mouse pointer, and the farther away the pointer is, the higher bounce. While the mouse button is held down, you go into jackhammer overdrive mode. There are keyboard equivalents\u2026 kind of. Use the arrow keys- left right to lean, up to jump higher, and down for jackhammer overdrive. If you get stuck, sorry.\r\n</p><p>The goal is to collect as many green jewels as you can before reaching the end of the world, where you will forever fall, deeper and deeper into the endless void.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:46:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27b63a4fbe4bfd8f216233ae56bbc4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Good.Enough Venson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
