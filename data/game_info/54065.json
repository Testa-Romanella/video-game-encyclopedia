This and Athletic World are the two games in the Family Fun Fitness series, designed and branded for the short-lived Family Fun Fitness mat accessory for the NES. Stadium Events allows players to compete in four different Olympic inspired sporting events, using the mat to move as they compete in running and jumping focused gameplay.<br />\nThe North American version was rebranded by Nintendo shortly after its 1987 release. The game was re-released as World Class Track Meet and the new mat was titled the Power Pad. Original North American copies of Stadium Events are now considered to be among the rarest NES games, leading to high prices in the secondary video game collecting market.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-30T06:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/0139a88f3a1a7d613f7393bc409db234.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Bandai", "Human Entertainment"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": null}
