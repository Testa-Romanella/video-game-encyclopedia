It also has some optional hard stuff for people who like a challenge.<h3>what's it like to play?</h3><br/><ul><li> 1 battle = 1 levelup, and the max level is 15. I don't want to waste your time with rpg grinding<br/></li><li> with only 20 Familiars in the game, you can max-out and understand all the familiars in the game within a few hours<br/></li><li> ... and then you're ready for the hard stuff<br/></li><li> find hidden portals to other dimensions, where you must manage your familiars' HP and your potion supply in a slew of battles against fairly smart CPU opponents<br/></li><li> or, if you want, fight other players you meet in the world to test your mettle</li></ul><h3>what else is there to like?</h3><br/><ul><li> it's extremely easy to pick up, play a bit, and put down<br/></li><li> the only way to communicate with other players is by pressing the \"howdy\" button repeatedly, or running around in circles<br/></li><li> I think the soundtrack is pretty nice<br/></li><li> it's free btw</li></ul><h3>it's free?</h3><br/>Yeah this is just a hobby project made by one person.
