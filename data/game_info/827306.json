Also if you're wondering how it's colorblind friendly is because the silhouettes of all characters are different (the Herobrines have fire in their hand, the Creepers have no arms, and the Player has a sword). Also I will be keeping this free 4 ever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:05:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/683/6836f83ecf179d5e130e6a7fb1e4f8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BrickNinja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
