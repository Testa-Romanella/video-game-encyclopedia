I'm going back to studying game development, and some animation techniques. I also bring the news that I'm starting to develop games for Android, since not all watchers and followers have access to Windows!</p>\n<p>The game is about Dawn, a character of mine that I intend to develop in the future. Dawn is a sweet and kind girl who has special powers like controlling the elements of nature and flying. I haven't done much about her yet, but I can tell you that she really likes having a big belly (she channels energy in her belly and can (and enjoys to) get huge).</p>\n<p>In this game, she is just doing a little flight training. The game is very simple. It has a mechanic similar to Flappy Bird, but with some changes! As I'm studying some mechanics, I'll probably post more simple games soon!</p>\n<p>The game was entirely developed and built by me! There's no virus!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hope you like it, guys! \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!
