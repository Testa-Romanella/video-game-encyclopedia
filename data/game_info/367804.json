The Goddess of Luck must have been smiling when she put so many X:COM and Roman History nerds in the same group. Our focus lay on streamlining the tactical combat of the day, simplifying and zooming in on a core of\u00a0asynchronous design concepts such as Stealth, Reverse Tower Defence,\u00a0Customization and Few-versus-Many.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Downloadable Game is a Prototype.
