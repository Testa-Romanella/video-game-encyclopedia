There's no gimmicks, just high-quality level design and crushing old-school difficulty, with some modern quality-of-life touches. If you don't usually play very difficult games, this is a good place to start. Plus: a delightful demoscene/tracker soundtrack from some of the genre's most eminent musicians! It is also a role-playing game, because you play the role of Lawyer Guy.<h3>Free, to keep, forever, no strings attached.</h3>This game is a weird passion project and I want to make it available to as many people as possible. Therefore, it is free. Later on, there will be a 'Deluxe Edition' available to purchase with a small amount of bonus content.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Multiple levels. To compare, a game like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\u2122 only has one level<br/></li><li> No shaders: absolutely no shaders. None.<br/></li><li> The motion captured performance of Tom Hanks<br/></li><li> Probably the only video game about a lawyer ever made.<br/></li><li> Portable checkpoints, so you can enjoy a checkpoint at home or on the go.<br/></li><li> Canon Gay<br/></li><li> The second ever strand type game<br/></li><li> A ranking system<br/></li><li> Not roguelike<br/></li><li> Doesn't cost any money even though I spent years making it.<br/></li><li> The Dark Souls\u00ae</li></ul><h3>Testimonials</h3>\"This game is too difficult\" -my friends<br/>\"How's that Lawyer Man game you're working on?\" -my family<br/>\"Lawyer Guy should have a katana made from nippon steel folded over 4000 times\" -internet anime reviewer<h3>Lawyer Guy needs YOU!</h3>If you have opinions about this game, head over to my website (link is -&gt; thataway), where you'll find playtester feedback forms and contact information.
