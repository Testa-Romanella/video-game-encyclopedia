{"id": 539371, "slug": "the-cursed-soldiers", "name": "The Cursed Soldiers", "name_original": "The Cursed Soldiers", "description": "<p>Following WWII, the Republic of Poland fell to the political and economic oppression of the Soviet Union. Under Joseph Stalin, the former anti-Nazi movement in Poland was crushed and the country\u00a0 absorbed into the Eastern Bloc. There it remained for the entirety of the Cold War, serving only as a pawn for the Soviets. Few realize, however, that from 1945-1946, Polish anti-Communist guerrillas fought heroically against the Soviet regime spreading through their country. To the Polish people, they were known as the Cursed Soldiers... so called due to the hopeless nature of their fight. But to the Soviets, they were a dangerous foe that successfully launched dozens of attacks on prisons, freeing hundreds of political prisoners.</p>\n<p>Play as\u00a0\u017belazny, an anti-Communist guerrilla, who must free his imprisoned companions (Sok\u00f3\u0142, Krzewin, Henryk, and Tarzan) while simultaneously launching a strategic offensive against the spreading Soviet forces. Move too slowly and risk being cut off from allies; move too quickly and risk facing an untimely end. Fight alone and risk being overwhelmed; fight together and face Soviet reinforcements. The only way to survive is through quick action and extreme strategy. <br/></p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<ul><li>Move your guerrillas by clicking and dragging.</li><li>Free additional guerrillas from prisons.</li><li>Guerrillas automatically attack nearby Soviet forces but will die if they come into direct contact.</li><li>The Soviets spread from generation points (major cities), but will be destroyed if they come into direct contact with\u00a0a guerrilla.</li><li>Press R to restart the game.</li><li>Press Q to quit.</li></ul>\n<p>Prepare for a cursed experience!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d235d5aaa4a63c7cc014bffa06f109cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["xcapaldi", "lcapaldi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
