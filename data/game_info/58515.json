It might take a little longer if you're learning, or a lot shorter if you jump into a pit of spikes.Warning: do not jump into a pit of spikes.<br/><br/><br/>HELLO! Would it be impolite if I were to nom on your armor and weapons? That shiny metal looks oh so delicious. Oh --pardon me, how rude of me not to introduce myself! I am Glooping Ooze, one of the many extremely polite denizens of the dungeons in this area. I even have my own card:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like all cards in <strong>One Deck Dungeon</strong>, mine is full of colored boxes, and HEY! What's the idea with all those arrows. Ugh, adventurers. So rude. So very very rude. I suppose you're rolling all your dice, attempting to fill in as many boxes as possible. For every one you don't fill, I'm going to make you pay for this arrow nonsense, in hearts and time! Precious time!<br/><br/>If you manage to get past me somehow, you'll be able to take Armor Crush as a skill, or add that magic icon on the left to your stats, or take the three experience lanterns in the upper-right.<br/><br/>Despite your arrowful attitude, I welcome you to the world of One Deck Dungeon. <strong>Adventure awaits!</strong><br/><br/>One Deck Dungeon is an officially licensed product of \u201cOne Deck Dungeon\u201d from Asmadi Games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/46819eab6c9b61a68dee31c1f5da73fb.jpg", "website": "http://onedeckdigital.com", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 171, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "Linux", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Handelabra Games", "Handelabra Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Board Games", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Handelabra Games", "Handelabra Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
