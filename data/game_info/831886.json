The basic idea is that if you kill another player you teleport to their location. Maybe that idea needs a bit of polishing but I rely on your feedback.<br/><br/>Project: Swap is just a game that I made because I wanted to. This game is nothing special and I just want to focus on having fun developing it. Also I want you the players to give me new ideas and lots of feedback<h3>Features that I might consider adding</h3><ul><li> Character customization<br/></li><li> New weapons (Some sort of laser rifle)<br/></li><li> New maps<br/></li><li> 3p animation rework</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T06:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c500b44c6c21a3dedbf42d809d9e0eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linus H."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Linus H."], "esrb_rating": null}
