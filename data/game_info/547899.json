You start to explore the world that you can only see through clinking noises. So you have to constantly make noises and, so to speak, send out sound waves in order to see your surroundings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You slip into the body of a bat. Accordingly, you can of course fly through the world and move a lot faster than a human. It is not easy to orientate yourself in such an environment. It's a completely unfamiliar experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are some objects in the world. Objects that can be recognized. Due to the unfamiliar way of seeing things, even well-known things are often not immediately apparent.</p>\n<p>link to the miro board</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa018a6ee96e3c814da7d75004bab783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["./studio3 Virtual Reality Seminar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
