Starwarriors is a webcomic by Scott Fraser about a group of celestial spirits fighting to protect and grant the wishes of all senteint beings in the cosmos.</p>\n<p>Take control of Taylor, the wandering leader of the Companions. A group of strong willed individuals from different worlds of different genres that band together to protect and mend the threads of the worlds that connect them all, and achieve the happy endings they were intended to have. Upon exploring a new and seemingly peaceful world, they wish upon a star only to be met in return by Ezmeralda, leader of the Starwarriors. Not knowing who these strange beings are, she cautiously addresses their wishes and offers to fight Taylor in order to strengthen him further for the adventures ahead to find the wish he truly seeks.</p>\n<p>While there may only be one fight in this demo, players can expect a series of different modes, difficulties, and weapons to shake up the way you approach the fight!</p>\n<p>This demo is made to bring awareness of the current Kickstarter going on for Starwarriors, if you\u2019d like to know more about the comic or secure your own copy, feel free to support the kickstarter and catch up on what you\u2019ve missed!: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/827584872/star-warriors-ezmeraldas-ascensio...</p>\n<p>This demo could not be made possible without the creative inspiration of the Starwarriors series, it\u2019d mean a lot to me if you could help fund it in any way you can! It\u2019s currently in it\u2019s last week and it\u2019s 70% funded, with just a bit more it\u2019s sure to rocket to it\u2019s goal just in time ^^<br/>If it gets to 100%, I may just end up updating this demo that lets you play the game from a new but familiar perspective!</p>\n<p>(Note: the contents of this demo are not canonical to Threadbound and may not appear in the final game. Threadbound itself may also not begin development for a number of years, but one can expect a game in this engine before then)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9ca72a823d8fd516cdffa8f622ccab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CHAOKO"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
