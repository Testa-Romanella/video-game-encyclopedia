A Presentation", "description": "<p>This is my entry for the Backtrace Game Jam from September 2021.\u00a0 The theme of the jam was \"Share Knowledge\"\u00a0and the requirement was to use the Backtrace tool to identify bugs in your code.</p>\n\n<p>My game is a point and click adventure game where you play a student who has to give a presentation on space. Search around and you might find some fun little items to make your presentation that much better!</p>\n\n<p>Assets used came from GameDevHQ\u00a0Filebase. Hologram effect via the Brackeys YouTube tutorial. Game implementation uses the Adventure Creator plugin available on the Unity Asset Store. Scientific info came from Wikipedia.</p><p>Please be patient if there are bugs or things aren't as polished as you'd hope. I was able to get about 85% of my plan built for this weekend game jam, but did not have time to fully test everything; mind you, there is a history of point-and-click adventure games having bugs so at least I'm in good company, right? Adjusting the music and adding sound effects were also left off.</p><p>The link to my Backtrace error log is here:\u00a0https://share.backtrace.io/api/share/7XbdNAU4mzGioV8DCIuyC1. I've added a screenshot to show the error reports as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d58/d5899df1fd7df59f6e8b4936953cfd7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weenie Walker Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
