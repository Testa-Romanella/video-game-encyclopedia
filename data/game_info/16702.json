{"id": 16702, "slug": "universe-sandbox", "name": "Universe Sandbox", "name_original": "Universe Sandbox", "description": "<p>Educational games came a long way, from solving simple math equations or spelling quizzes. Universe sandbox allows players to observe effects of gravity on a large scale. Players will be able to change the properties of any objects at any time, which is explained with built-in tutorials and step-by-step activities. All simulations are based on the real scientific data, physics, and units.<br />\nPlayers are invited to experiment and see for themselves, to observe the slightest theoretical changes across 70+ different pre-made simulations, real or fictional. Universe Sandbox is designed and formed not only as an educational tool, where players can use all editing and creation tools to form their own simulations but as a demonstrative showcase. The game supports anaglyphic 3D glasses and 3D DLP televisions.<br />\nIt invites imagination in the astrophysics, where players can add planets, moons, stars and even black holes to already existing systems, or player created ones.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2011-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18c/18c0bf89ecef8170cdd97075dbbadded.jpg", "website": "http://universesandbox.com/", "rating": 3.01, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 1377, "beaten": 36, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 74, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 152, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 153, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Giant Army"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Giant Army"], "esrb_rating": null}
