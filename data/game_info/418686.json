You must shoot aliens to protect yourself and your farm. The aliens will drop some weapons and food they have stolen from other humans, which you can collect. Weapons will give you the weapon and a clip worth of ammo. Food will give you health back and will increase your max health, but beware, as eating too much food can make you gain weight and become slower. Luckily, Dan Danman\u2019s metabolism is REALLY fast, and he can lose the weight he gained after just a small distance of walking. However, if you decide to eat more food during the walk, you will need to walk farther. Now, go defend your farm from those aliens, and most importantly, have fun!!</p>\n<p>- description written by\u00a0https://ldjam.com/users/coderk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224640e10c5d1dc661e79458fa34b755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stevie Dong"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
