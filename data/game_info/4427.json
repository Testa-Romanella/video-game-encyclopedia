And after his awakening 10 years later, players will help to save the last sane citizens of Rapture. As seen in the previous game, the player will have access to new weapons, unique to Big Daddies, power drill and a rivet gun, alongside an array of plasmids, Tonics, and guns. Now players will be able not only save Little Sisters from other Big Daddies, and then either harvest ADAM directly, or protect them while they collect ADAM for their new guardian. Bioshock introduces a new enemy type, Big Sisters, which are extremely agile and fast versions of Big Daddies. Newly added multiplayer brings several never seen formats to the series. Aside from expected Deathmatches, the game added story-driven mode Fall of Rapture.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2010-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T17:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/157/15742f2f67eacff546738e1ab5c19d20.jpg", "website": "http://www.bioshockgame.com", "rating": 4.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 767, "owned": 7486, "beaten": 1835, "toplay": 258, "dropped": 390, "playing": 44}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 381, "ratings_count": 1876, "suggestions_count": 645, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1890, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "2K", "Digital Extremes", "2K Australia", "2K Marin", "2K China"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
