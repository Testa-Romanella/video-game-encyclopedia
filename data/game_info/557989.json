{"id": 557989, "slug": "bomb-bot-prototype", "name": "Bomb Bot (Prototype)", "name_original": "Bomb Bot (Prototype)", "description": "<p>This is a prototype of a programming puzzle game <em>Bomb Bot</em>, where you would program a bomb-disposal robot. It's inspired by the old Flash game <em>LightBot</em>, and was mostly build for fun as a proof-of-concept, though I'd happily revisit it again in the future (probably with an actual artist involved). <br/></p>\n<p>For a demo of how a level may play out, <strong>try to move the three bombs onto the three orange \"disposal tiles\", then end with the bot on the green tile at the end of the hall</strong>. This should require the use of at least one function. The game will not indicate to you that you've won, but trust me, it knows.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Click and drag the instruction blocks on the left into the empty squares, then press the play button to execute. <br/></p>\n<p>- The main function at the bottom will be first, and it will call functions A, B, and C if the corresponding instruction block is encountered.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>- Grab and drop commands can be used to pick up and drop bombs in the direction that the bot is facing.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE COOL PART</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Yes,<strong> </strong>a function can call itself! Press the pause button if it gets  stuck looping. \"Infinite\" loops will always stop eventually after ~5 minutes due to implementation (technically they work more like macros).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eff/eff88cf798bdbfa62ad5fbffe3282933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oliver Morrish"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
