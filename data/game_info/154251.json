This project was used to demonstate how I would create an immersive level with a beginning and end. I also used this project as an opportunity to experiment with some C# scripting, creating a temperature guage, a weather change, transition effects and so on.</p><p>The goal of the game is to perform repairs on the Wind Turbine while trying not to let your body temperature get too low. Players are free to explore the open environment, although they have a very limited time to do so if they decide to wander away from area's with heat sources, which essentially reset the time limit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/2386b7e8e84fdaefcb5f811baf225a1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Conor Hughes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
