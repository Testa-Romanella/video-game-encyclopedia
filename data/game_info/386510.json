This is akin to a typical <strong>TV sitcom</strong> in the sense that each episode focuses on a certain situation or scenario that has a beginning, middle and end as opposed to a larger, overarching narrative found in serialized television. <br/><br/>All nine of these episodes are selectable from the main menu at the get go and aim to reinforce the idea of daily life mundanity but with a <strong>comedic</strong> and <strong>nonsensical</strong> twist as you come across the inhabitants of this<strong> very strange</strong> city and get up to various <strong>shenanigans</strong>. <br/><br/>Get to know a <strong>wide cast of colourful personalities</strong>!! in this short, whimsical, light-hearted and fun slice-of-life comedy.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Pixel Art style<br/></li><li>Linear, scenario-based structure with nine different episodes<br/></li><li>Fun cast of characters<br/></li><li>Pick up and play at your own pace! <br/></li><li>Free!!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Punchline!! was made by me in the ridiculous amount of free time I had, so if you don't like it, feel free to tell me how much it sucks over on the Twitters.
