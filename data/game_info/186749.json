That's why it's more an Interactive experience than a real video game. Play with a controller for a full experience.<br/></p><p>In this experience, players will walk on water. Around them, there is plenty of minimal representations of diving board. Under their feet, a fascinating sinkhole. <br/></p><p>The horizon is also a delimitation of space around us, it's what allow us to be in the center of that space.  In my installation I propose an interpretation of what the horizon means for me. It's a promise of a whole secret world beyond the field of view.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79fef566225cb7102134f512d4c1788f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FoulardPigeon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
