Moritz, unfortunately, had eaten too much and was almost asleep when he heard those famous words, \"they put a Man on the Moon! \". Just before he fell into a deep sleep, Moritz murmured... \"... they put a dog on the moon.\" Seconds later Moritz enters the land of dreams and it is now up to us to make it reach the Moon, avoiding all enemies and preferably not run out of fuel. Only then can Moritz enter into a new state of consciousness. But will there be more once he lands on the moon?</p>\n\n<p><em>Rest in peace in my friend!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbd5246a3b9a1163e5fa9f95328ee8ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZXAMAZE"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
