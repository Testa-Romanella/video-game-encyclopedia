It's your job to create the desired muffins for the desired orders. Mess up on it and there'll be consequences.</p>\n<p>This project was originally made to test my programming skills and I say I did pretty good for the most part. I would add more features, but I kind of lost a bit of motivation for it and didn't want to stick to just one big project. I'm overall glad that I got to create all the music, art, and programming. Depending on the support from this game, I may add more features, levels, and polishing.</p>\n<p>Unity Asset Used:</p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0Free Pixel Font: Thaleah - TinyWorlds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59d09a4317f023d4f0659dbe71b930df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rykuzu Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
