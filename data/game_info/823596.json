You will experience the lives of many cells involved in the immune system. Learn about the objectives of different cell types involved in the immune response, and fight against invading pathogens. <br/><br/>Many factors in this game, such as appearances and interactions between cells, have been altered, to fit better into a game and a good story. Despite the alterations, all events and characters in this game are based upon how the human immune system works in real life, and as a result, we aim to teach everyone who plays our game a bit more about the immune system than they knew before. Furthermore, students in medical or biological areas may find this game useful to visualize the interactions within the human body. Although some amount of scientific accuracy has been lost, this makes a much easier to understand.<br/><br/>This game has been developed by University of Warwick students, and the story has been fact-checked by Professors of Warwick, to stay relatively accurate to the actual science behind it.
