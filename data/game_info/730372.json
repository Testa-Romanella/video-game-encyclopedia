A group of somewhat newbies came together to make a game over a weekend, but unfortunately technical difficulties resulted in the project not being fully completed by the time the deadline rolled around. We are submitting this as a proof-of-concept, so we can show off the hard work we put in to creating this atmospheric nightmare, even if it's not fully implemented yet!<br/><br/><br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Wake up and pull yourself back together.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>You slowly come to your senses as you awake in a garden, and everything is... off. Home has become unrecognisable - everything is twisted and nothing is where it is supposed to be.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Your eyes are getting heavier and it suddenly feels like shadows are stalking you. You need to get back to your room and pull yourself together, but will the nightmare end there?<br/><br/><strong>Like this proof-of-concept?
