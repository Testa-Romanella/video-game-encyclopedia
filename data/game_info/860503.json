Knock asteroids off course by ramming your multi-billion dollar self into them. And then do it again and again because you're surprisingly sturdy. If you fail, know that the entire earth will be obliterated. No pressure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in under 48 hours (actually under 24 hours) for the Ludum Dare 51 competition with the theme of <em>every 10 seconds</em>. The game fits that theme as a new\u00a0asteroid approaches every 10 seconds, but the acceleration and mass of each is greater than the last. All code, art, and sound were created by myself during the jam aside from some basic libraries and the Unity game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T17:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2fb7c3c03c8235b23fb70da0f53b60f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ha1fBit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
