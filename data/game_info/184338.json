It uses concepts from SCUMM, LucasArts in-house engine, and shows my own take on such a game engine. The TestGame was used for debugging and uses some of the engines features. To play unzip, navigate to the game folder (containing folders for rooms, objects, characters,...) and hit play.</p><p>On Mac the file explorer was reported as not functional and crashing the program, although the test model was quite old. Linux does not work for unknown reasons, will maybe be fixed in the distant future. Please let me know of any problems or bugs, thank you.</p><p>There will be a proper demo game released in the near future.</p><p>All games should be available on this site, they can also be downloaded from http://bit.ly/sepesGames as uncompressed and compressed folders.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f22b72c105474b4aad5eef5bd8f76fcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SomethinBoutGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
