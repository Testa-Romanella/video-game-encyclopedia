There's also a limited set of resources you have to thoughtfully allocate between all of these layers. All the while you're aided by Hero, who's crawling through a dungeon full of monsters in search of resources to help you build up the Wilderness, the Village, the City, and what lies beyond...<br/><br/>Other notes: this game is primarily idle.
