This short, silly game teaches the player things about these games by having the student play one.   </p>\n<p>The player is led through progressively harder and more high-resolution games until finally reaching their goal, all the while being explicitly taught the history of 2D Platformers and implicitly taught the fundamentals through gameplay and level design.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I made this game after trying to learn the Unity game engine in a matter of days, and after a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, I have a working build. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed making it!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Windows PC\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to install:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Unzip the .zip file to a folder on your computer\r\n  </li><li>Once unzipped, Click the \u201cMiyamoto\u2019s Run\u201d application in that folder\r\n  </li><li>Enjoy!\r\n  </li></ol>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Left Arrow \u2013 Move left\r\n  </p>\n<p>Right Arrow \u2013 Move right\r\n  </p>\n<p>Up Arrow \u2013 Jump</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>All assets were either created by me or downloaded from free-to-use asset collections that require no licensing</em></p><ul><li>larsiusprime: Super Miyamoto (sprites) -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/super-miyamoto</li><li>Superjustinbros: Donkey Kong\u00a0Tiles (tile sprites) -\u00a0https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/dk/sheet/106602/</li></ul><ul><li>DotStudio:\u00a0Super Mario 1 Remade Asset\u00a0(tile sprites) - https://dotstudio.itch.io/super-mario-1-remade-assets</li></ul><ul><li>Ansimuz: MegaBot Areas Pack 1 (tile sprites)-https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/megabot-areas-pack-1-195249</li><li>Ansimuz: Sunny Land\u00a0(tile sprites)- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349</li></ul><ul><li>CodeMan38: Press Start 2P (font) -https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P</li></ul><ul><li>Unity Engine - https://unity.com/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/760216b9025905499fdeb73b2eb83f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sanjay_w"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
