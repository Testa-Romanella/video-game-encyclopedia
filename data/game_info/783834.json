These may be in the form of financial hardship and the inability to pay a bill, fill a car with fuel, clothe a child, or provide groceries for their family. The Community Assistance Program seeks to bridge these gaps with funds that are raised through donations by the community. As firefighters, we believe we have a special and unique opportunity to intervene in someone\u2019s life during their most difficult time to help lessen the burden of financial stress. We are so grateful for the ability to help our community out in this way.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/171/171db0689dbd187c77aebc9a10afb2c6.jpg", "website": "https://www.mamamakesgames.com/hellfire-1988", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mama Makes Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mama Makes Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
