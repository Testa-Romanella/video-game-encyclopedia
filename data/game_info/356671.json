In accordance with http://account.mojang.com/documents/brand_guidelines<br/><br/>Sometimes playing alone becomes boring and boring. However, New Comes Alive Mod for MCPE will help to solve this problem by adding new types of inhabitants, with which you can interact in various ways.<br/>In the future, you can even marry a villager and have children with him or her. This is a great way to develop in the world of MCPE and this makes the game much more interesting.<br/>Create a new world to begin with and make sure that you created it in survival mode. After the world is loaded, the item Crystal Ball should appear in your inventory. Click on the ground with this object to continue.<br/>Next you will find yourself in a small room with bookshelves and an enchanting table. Click on the table to decide your fate.<br/>Choose the floor, who will play. I live with my family - you find yourself at home with your wife and children. \u200b\u200bI live alone - you find yourself in the house, alone.I live in a village - you will find yourself in a village with a small population.<br/> None of them - you will remain in the ordinary world where you originally appeared. But nevertheless, you can still find village residents and marry them, have children in the process of marriage, and also develop as a couple.<br/>There are many different people with whom you can interact, but I decided to approach this girl. Hold down a little on the screen and see the interaction button ^Interact^ in the center of the screen.<br/>Click this button and the graphical interface will open. This girl's name is Elly and she works as a baker. She, apparently a peaceful person, but dissatisfied for some reason. She is not married, so maybe I have a chance to cheer her up and marry her. What do you think?<br/>The only working buttons for interaction are Follow Me, Stay Here and Move Freely. All buttons are self-explanatory, are not they?<br/>I asked her to follow me and we went to the beach.
