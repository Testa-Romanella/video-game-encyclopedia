The only problem is that nobody else seems to be in a rush.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS/HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You have a limited amount of ammo before you have to reload. Left click to shoot cars in your way\u00a0(Don't worry, the passengers are definitely okay\u00a0with this!), and pick up powerups along the way to gain extra ammo or HP. A and D to move left and right.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Main Song - Matthew Pablo (http://www.matthewpablo.com)<br/>Game Over Jingle - Me<br/>Art -\u00a0Kenney (https://kenney.nl)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/7981b6ede72eb8de5ceb5875bd31b77f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0ut0fnameideas"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
