{"id": 243523, "slug": "hex-for-ipad", "name": "Hex for iPad", "name_original": "Hex for iPad", "description": "Hex is a strategy board game played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11\u00d711 rhombus. Other popular dimensions are 13\u00d713 and 19\u00d719 as a result of the game's relationship to the older game of Go. According to the book A Beautiful Mind, John Nash (one of the game's inventors) advocated 14\u00d714 as the optimal size.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>The game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein, who introduced it in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was independently re-invented in 1947 by the mathematician John Nash at Princeton University. Hex is an abstract strategy game that belongs to the general category of \"connection\" games. <br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Each player has an allocated color, Red and Blue being conventional. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal is to form a connected path of your stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by your color, before your opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.<br/><br/>The turn of each player is shown by a red or blue disc on a side of the board game.<br/>The player must touch a cell to fill it with his own color. After that, he can cancel his last move using the 'Undo' button, and redo a different move. When the move is done, the turn comes of the opponent player.<br/><br/>John Nash proved in 1952 that a game of Hex cannot end in a tie, and that for a symmetric board there exists a winning strategy for the player who makes the first move (by the strategy-stealing argument). However, the argument is non-constructive: it only shows the existence of a winning strategy, without describing it explicitly. Finding an explicit strategy has been the main subject of research since then.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f0903e03bec3d6af07894140bd04b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
