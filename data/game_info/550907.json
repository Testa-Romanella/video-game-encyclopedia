Run from the scary hand of doom as you get as many 'buggies' as possible! With <strong>completely randomized obstacles and collectables</strong>, every run is a little different. My cat Koa, a beast of burden, was the entire inspiration for this project. She chases household items that she thinks are buggies\u00a0<em>on the daily.</em> However, we both really wanted to make a 2d game that we could consider a complete work, and this was the most fun and adorable thing we could think of.
