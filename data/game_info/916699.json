With pixel art retro graphics, you must navigate through a medieval fantasy world, collecting food and growing your swarm while avoiding danger from enemies. As the leader of the rats, you must unravel the mystery behind the origin of your swarm and ultimately defeat a powerful enemy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0With each turn, your rats consume food and if you don't have enough, you'll lose a rat. You can spend food to place a nest, which over time will grow and give you new rats. With limited time and resources, every decision counts in this short, intense game.</p>\n<p>Check out my twitter</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move: WASD or arrows or left stick</p>\n<p>Roate: shift + Move or right stick</p>\n<p>Spawn nest:\u00a0 E or R1 or X</p>\r\nCredits:\r\nImages:\r\n<p>Image by Freepik</p>\n<p>Image by Freepik</p>\n<p>Image by Freepik</p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>\"Overworld\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\r\nIcons:\r\n<p>https://ansdor.itch.io/button-icons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7bb9677188efb84c8d705159476635a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Malgios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
