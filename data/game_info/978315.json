How about hard arcade action? Have you ever wondered what would happen if a survivor-style game had a baby with old-school carnage in a fast, action based shooter full of twisted metal and brain dead hordes?<br/><br/>If the answer is yes, well then... get in and buckle up! The answer to \"Are we alone?\" has been answered, the aliens have finally landed, and it is the Alien Apocalypse. The little green men have cranked up their mind control to 11 and taken over humanity, save one! Everyone is out for the blood of the last would-be heroine!<br/><br/>Who is our hapless heroine? Who could possibly resist the numbing mind control that fell humanity in the Alien Apocalypse? What gallant and noble heroine could rise from the best of the best humanity had to offer? Who, you ask? It is the clinically insane, morally flexible, car-loving protagonist with an insatiable appetite for death, destruction, and nothing to lose but some questionable dignity in defeat...

Forge Lexi's path through the horde of mindless humans and aliens with flames, fire, tire marks, and a whole bunch of bullets, missiles, and other mishandled and often misappropriated alien weaponry.<br/><br/>You're in for a wild ride of mayhem and machine guns. You got enough firepower to make the bravest hero blush; a cute anime girl who's got a date with final destiny; and a gas-guzzling, 900-horsepower beast of a modified sports car that's armed to the teeth and a tank full of fuel, and a driver seat full of fury!<br/><br/><ul><li> Short rounds of play for quick pick-up and play styles, or just killing some time (and aliens) during a break.<br/></li><li> Start with your basic bullet bursting ballistics and upgrade your weapons and arsenal throughout each round.<br/></li><li> Upgrade your ride of sweet slaughter to suit your gameplay... do you want to be a high-octane glass cannon, a Sunday driving shooter, or something else?<br/></li><li> Jam out to the jingles... what's a little death and destruction without some rocking tunes to accompany the rocket fire?<br/></li><li> Drive through hordes of mind-controlled humans, leaving their salt, tears, and dreams in puddles of blood and guts.<br/></li><li> Cute anime protagonist.</li></ul><br/>At this point...what's not to like?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T14:57:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a55c2896c10ab127492750b198c0de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gnaw Paw Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gnaw Paw Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
