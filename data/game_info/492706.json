My co-worker found a kitten in one of the classrooms at the school and he was in very bad condition. Because I already had a cat (Ma-eum, which means \"heart\" in Korean\u00a0[\ub9c8\uc74c]),\u00a0I had a lot of cat supplies, so\u00a0I took him in and\u00a0I nursed him back to health, intending to find another home for him, but he was very lovable so I ended up keeping him. He is named after where we found him--an elementary school, which in Korean is \"cho-deung-hakgyo\" (\ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uad50).\u00a0For short, I call him Cho.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d32e97547308e257a23218194265aa7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lin Augustine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
