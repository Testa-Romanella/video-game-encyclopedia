Being a gecko, his sticky feet allow him to safely walk on smooth ceilings and reach otherwise inaccessible areas. He also can throw his tail like a boomerang, and since it always returns to him, his friend Hait can grab onto it, to cross steep chasms.<br/><br/></p>\r\nHait, the Monkey\r\n<p>\r\n    Hait is always up for a new adventure, especially when bananas are waiting at the end! His healthy diet was all worth the while - Hait's strength allows him to catapult his partner Reech high up into the air, hoping for his buddy to land on steady ground. Besides that, Hait enjoys working out by climbing vines and pushing large boulders.\r\n</p>\n\r\nGameplay Preview\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GAME ONLY PLAYABLE WITH AT MOST\u00a0ONE KEYBOARD OR <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 TWO XBOX CONTROLLERS</p>\n\r\nContributors\r\n<p>Nicolas Vana (aka Zel'ak'irr) - Game Design, Game Programming, Production</p>\n<p>Christina Bugram (aka @naeno_art) - Concept Art, Character Design, Character Animations, 2D Assets</p>\n<p>Lisa Grall - Concept Art, Character Design, 2D Assets</p>\n<p>Lukas Sch\u00f6nwiese (SoundCloud) - Music and Sound</p>\n<p>Raffael Moser (aka RaMo_teamhellep) - Additional Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a21/a210a14151b5aec2306c632724b855a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["RaMo_teamhellep", "The Pigeon Protocol", "Zel'ak'irr", "naeno_art"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
