{"id": 805798, "slug": "ruins-of-vha", "name": "Ruins of Vha", "name_original": "Ruins of Vha", "description": "<p>A turn-based rpg set in a jungle ruin. You and a party of adventurers are on a mission to catalog each room and report back to your adventuring guild, the Company of Strangers. The party is forced to take shelter within the ruin to avoid a jungle predator, and are swept into an interior chamber. From there, the player must explore the ruin to find a way out, or to unlock its secrets. This game is intended to be a tight retro experience reminiscent of a Dungeons and Dragons adventure, and is meant to be completed in one or two play sessions.\u00a0The build 0.11 is more of an early prototype, and I\u00a0have\u00a0plans for a\u00a0more\u00a0complete\u00a0version in the\u00a0works.</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention in-game that you can use WASD or arrow keys to move for now. More options will be available in future versions.</p>\n\n<p>Known issues in v0.12<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The menu button is a wiggly boy.</li><li>Your party members sometimes appear during dialogue or cutscenes when they shouldn't (hanging out behind the player). Sometimes the player is frozen in a walking animation during these scenes.</li><li>Description text that displays after placing an urn at the northwest statue is sometimes garbled at the start.</li></ul>\n<p>Fixes from v0.11</p>\n<ul><li>Pressing \"Quit\" button in menus in the browser version no longer freezes the game. Instead, it displays a message for 5 seconds, telling you that the quit button is disabled in the web version.</li><li>Fixed various typos, but I'm sure there are others still lurking in there.</li><li>Background Music should now loop correctly.</li><li>Urns and Statues should remember what state they should be in when returning from the camp scene or combat.</li><li>A certain character will now correctly tell you when you've killed all of the monsters. More of their dialogue is now accessible.</li><li>Statues and urns should no longer render in front of the player.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eed57dce53f1dbf35acd3a37bb8fddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Ian Douglass - Trashwizz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
