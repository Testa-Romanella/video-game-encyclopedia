Also, avoid the web build if possible. :)</p>\n\n<p>Resist and Persist is a game about holding onto planets, but\r\nalso knowing when to give them up. With aliens attacking your planets, and with\r\ncivilians trying to escape, you\u2019re not going to be able to hold on to\r\neverything you\u2019ve got. But having no planets is better than having them\r\ncaptured. So sometimes, you have to turn the guns on your own, and sacrifice all\r\nyou\u2019ve fought for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Aliens have come to destroy your planets! Your civilians\r\nneed to evacuate, and they're putting their trust in you to buy them time. How\r\nlong can you hold off the invaders to let your citizens escape?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or the arrow keys to move your ship.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Click to fire your guns and destroy the aliens!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right click on planets to sacrifice them (blow them up) to\r\nprevent aliens from taking them over! Note: Planets can only be sacrificed when\r\ntheir shields are completely reduced.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Objective:</p>\n<p>To try to get the highest score possible! Points can be\r\ngained by:</p>\n<p>-Destroying Aliens</p>\n<p>-Surviving Waves</p>\n<p>-Evacuating Civilians</p>\n<p>Civilians can only be evacuated between enemy waves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can lose points by: </p>\n<p>-Having a Planet Invaded</p>\n<p>-Losing Turrets</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Types of Aliens:</p>\n<p>Speeders: These tiny cruisers are fast and furious, but\r\ntheir shields are very weak. Don\u2019t let their blasters tear you apart!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carriers: Big ships with lots of shields. They spawn\r\nspeeders and fire big bullets that tear your planets apart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bombers: Small, slow ships with big guns. They will target\r\nyour turrets, so be careful! (Image of bomber)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Landers: These slow ships neutralize your planets when they\r\nlose their shields. Don\u2019t let them capture your worlds or face a massive point\r\nreduction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turrets: Like your turrets, but bad. Also you can\u2019t destroy\r\nthem. Enough said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's about all there is to it-- remember, don't let the\r\naliens get ahold of any of your planets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae34e46ac4449cb9b81270bc912f0bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Frog Rock Game Jams"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
