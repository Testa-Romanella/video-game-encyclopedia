Players who buy the game will receive all chapters regardless of when you purchased it.<br/><br/><br/>Fuchian Chronicles is a remake of my first game, Space Fox Kimi, which was originally released on Steam in 2018. I have learned a lot about game development since my first release, and wanted to update the game with new graphics, gameplay, and various other improvements before continuing with a sequel. Players who\u2019ve played Space Fox Kimi will notice many similarities in the story with the original, but some story beats have been altered and there will be new plot points as well.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope you enjoy my game, and thank you for supporting me!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/9211b7d9db56b04817dd164015519c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShenTzu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["ShenTzu Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
