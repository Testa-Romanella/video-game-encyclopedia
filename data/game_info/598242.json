Now you can collect coins throughout the gameplay to unlock interesting skins. (Note that skins and hats are pure cosmetics don't affect collision box)<br/><br/>Coins are not always spawned, the higher you score, the greater your chances of getting a coin spawned. And you also have a chance to encounter bonus level, which gives more coins, but weirder pattern of platform spawning.<br/><br/>Enjoy and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T07:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5f2f9354364a75cb991d70b47ef7ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
