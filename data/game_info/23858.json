This gives a similar \n      experience without all the setup that is usually needed. Adventure Party \n      is a unique story driven role playing party game where one player plays \n      as the Storyteller. The Storyteller uses the Wii U GamePad to control \n      the world and interact with the other players. This is done like a \n      tabletop, pen and paper, RPG allowing all players to focus on Role \n      Playing. The other players are the Adventurers and when they interact \n      with the world they need to interact with the Storyteller. The \n      Storyteller takes on the role of a villager, shop keep, enemy, or anyone \n      else the adventurers interact with. This allows the storyteller to \n      tailor the story and comedy of the situation to fit their friends. This \n      creates unique and hilarious situations as the Storyteller guides their \n      friends through the story on an epic quest to save the world! The \n      Adventurers will need to remain together and make decisions as a group \n      in order to succeed.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fe005e50e6ccb671331110c809bf01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["E-Regular Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["E-Regular Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
