It has nearly all functionality I planned, tho theres is very little content to actually play. Just uploaded here for the lulz. Dont expect much.</p>\n<p>Important:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gamepad required, there is no support for kb+m.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Music is pretty loud and cant be adjusted, but since there are no soudeffects you might as well adjust through your os directly.</p>\n<p>Go into the hut, there is some info to read at the table and the chest containts your \"healthbar\"</p>\n\n<p>Press R3 to toggle focus on enemies<br/></p>\n\n<p>Disclosure:</p>\n<p>Demo is not the right term, its more a prototype, so there is little to no explanation how anything works and is REALLY buggy. Also this will mot be developed any further since Im not happy with the quality of anything, especially the terrible Camera.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T04:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f38c13420468a744b40c7b7ecac23852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renschnitzel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
