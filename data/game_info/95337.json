Your power bar limits your progression through the game. every time you fire your power bar reduces. Every time you get hit your power bar reduces. The only way to get more power is to defeat enemies, but don\u2019t miss too many times as if you don\u2019t have enough power to defeat the boss at the end each wave of enemies, you're done for!<br/></p>\n<p>Created in C++ from scratch, all resources (except for the Font) were created by the team in the 48 hours as part of the GMTK Game Jam.<br/>featuring pseudo random enemies, in ever increasing waves. The game plays like an endless runner where the user tries to stay alive for as long as possible. <br/>The visuals display 8 layers of parallax scrolling to give depth to the 2D world.<br/>To play, move around with the arrow keys and fire with space bar. Kill all the enemies to continue. But be careful not to run out of power, it provides your health, your ammo, and your means of progression.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT<br/>To run the game you may need to install MSVCp120.dll<br/>This is included in the folder</p>\n<p>You may need to install both vcredist_x86 and vcredist_x64</p>\n\n<p>ALSO IMPORTANT<br/>If you cant get the game to run, download the file release.zip.
