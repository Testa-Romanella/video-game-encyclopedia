{"id": 817281, "slug": "nostrallint", "name": "Nostrallint", "name_original": "Nostrallint", "description": "<p>Nostrallint is an arcade style game in which you repeatedly play rounds and try to get a high score. You control a mage using</p>\n<ol><li>the W, A, S, D keys to run.\r\n</li><li>the space bar to jump.\r\n</li><li>the mouse to look around.\r\n</li><li>the left mouse button to charge your magical attack.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>Periodically, enemies will appear at the edge of the clearing and start chasing you. Once they catch you, the round is over. It is your aim to dodge the enemies and blast them away with your magical attack. Each enemy you hit increases your score. Enemies spawn all around you, so watch your back! At the start of the round, enemies are slow, but they\u2019ll pick up the pace as the round progresses.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Your attack is tied to the rhythm of the game\u2019s music</strong>. You can start charging it at any point by clicking the left mouse button (you do not need to hold it). You cannot move while charging, so be careful! A display on the bottom of the screen shows the remaining time your attack will need to be charged. The minimal charging duration is 1 quarter note. When the spell has finished charging, it is automatically unleashed and you regain movement control.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Please make sure you play with the sound enabled at a comfortable volume!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efbfb1a4bd88f449ac56437a5adc3761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JanKXSKI"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
