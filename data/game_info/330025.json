You, as an alchemist/necromancer recently woke up from hibernation,\u00a0must create yourself a new body\u00a0to sustain your existence.\u00a0In alchemy, there are three principles: salt (soul), mercury (spirit), sulphur (soul). Combine\u00a0the three principles to manipulate life force around you. Create rats to do your errands. Infect sewers to increase tombs near you. Explode tombs to obtain the three principles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme music\u00a0is composed by my dear friend \u0130brahim Y\u0131lmaz (https://soundcloud.com/ibrahim-yilmaz-770409070).</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Daniel Linssen (https://managore.itch.io)\u00a0for the font and Juhani Junkala (https://juhanijunkala.com) for sound effects.</p>\n<p>Made for JamCraft 3.</p>\n<p><strong>---\u00a0PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING ---</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys\u00a0to Move / Rotate</li><li>Space Bar to Activate / Deactivate</li><li>Tab to Open Crafting</li><li>F to Open Upgrade</li><li>Enter to Craft / Upgrade</li><li>Esc to Open\u00a0Menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can have maximum three of each principle.</li><li>You get random three bonus principles on passing day.</li><li>You have three tomb slots in map.</li><li>You queue tombs when you infect sewers which will spawn on the next day with empty tomb slots.</li><li>You can have only one of each recipes (Rat, Bomb, Plague) at the same time in the level.</li><li>You can only have one specialty (Bomb or Plague) on your rat at the same time.</li><li>Your rat loses one HP, when you activate the specialty.</li><li>You build your body gradually, when you craft an organ.</li><li>You get one upgrade at start and one every time you craft an organ.</li><li>You start with Level 1\u00a0upgrades and \u00a0can upgrade to Level 3.</li><li>You see green arrow on tank, if you have unspent upgrade point.</li><li>You win when you complete\u00a0\u00a0building \u00a0your new body.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Recipes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Salt + Mercury = Rat</li><li>Salt + Sulphur = Bomb</li><li>Mercury + Sulphur = Plague</li><li>Salt + Mercury + Sulphur = Organ</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Upgrades</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Rat (Level 1: 1 HP, Level 2: 2 HP, Level 3: 3 HP)</li><li>Bomb (Level 1: 3 drops on explode, Level 2: 6 drops on explode, Level 3: 9 drops on explode)</li><li>Plague (Level 1: spawns 1 tomb, Level 2: spawns 2 tombs, Level 2: spawns 3 tombs)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8b9710afa1c5f41a5eb022eb3aa823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["klumzyr"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
