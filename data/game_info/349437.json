You take control and tell them to gather materials and build walls, floors and furniture.<br />\nYou are not limited to predefined buildings! Design your own houses and style them to your liking. There are dozens of construction and furniture elements that you can use to create the settlement you\u2019ve always dreamed of!<br />\nTake Care Of Your Colonists<br />\nThe colonists are your top priority. At first, you simply need to provide them with food and shelter. But the world is full of dangers! An infection might prove fatal to the strongest warrior and a plague can wipe out your entire colony.<br />\nEach colonist reacts to events, happy or sad, and reflects that in their behavior. Happy colonists will receive a boost to their productivity \u2013 Unhappy colonists might throw a temper tantrum.<br />\nDeal With Tantrums<br />\nIn an ideal life, all your wishes come true, at least that\u2019s what Toni thinks. Fulfilled wishes can promote good moods, while hunger, injuries, boring conversations, or even nightmares will make your citizens feel bad.<br />\nIf you ignore the needs and wishes of your colonists for too long, one of them might have a breakdown and throw a trantrum.<br />\nAt That Point, All Bets Are Off\u2026<br />\nSet up your FarmFood matters. Good food makes colonists happy, wrong food makes colonists sick, little food makes colonists slow, and no food makes colonists die.<br />\nGrow a variety of seasonal crops and set up a kitchen to make delicious meals. Be sure to stock up before winter hits and act quick when a swarm of hungry bugs descends upon your fields!<br />\nSurvive WinterUse the time you have and make sure you have enough food stored away, for winter is coming. Let\u2019s hope you won\u2019t have to halve rations \u2013 because that will make your colonists weak.<br />\nWhen supplies dwindle and the freezing cold wind howls outside, it\u2019s easy to lose hope.<br />\nTrade Goods and Get RichWord got around that your colony has started producing wares. Greet traveling traders and see if you can get a good deal on some ancient scrolls or buy additional food to prepare for winter.<br />\nTry to keep production up so you\u2019ll always have something to sell. A mature colony needs to pay good salaries to keep everyone happy. If morale is low, additional funds can even buy a tiny bit of happiness!<br />\nResearch TechnologiesBuilding your home is a long process and resources and manpower are not the only things you need. Smart Settlers dedicate a lot of time to researching new technologies, thereby unlocking better equipment, new furniture and construction elements.<br />\nSelect scholars carefully \u2013 if their personality doesn\u2019t fit this type of work, they are not going to make a lot of progress.<br />\nProtect Your OutpostYou are not alone in this new land you call \u2018home\u2019. The Tikigoblins living there are not all that happy about your settling efforts and might pay you a visit to try to get you to stop.<br />\nTrain your colonists in the art of warfare and equip them with the best weapons and armor you have. Build walls and towers to ensure the security of your colony \u2013 that way, your enemies will have a difficult time trying to mess with you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-29T14:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901ce469000310e5d06f197e32da392b.jpg", "website": "https://foundersfortune.com", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 192, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 7, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Oachkatzlschwoaf Interactive", "Dionic"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oachkatzlschwoaf Interactive", "Dionic"], "esrb_rating": null}
