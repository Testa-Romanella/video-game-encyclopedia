Ship controls are simple - WASD to boost in cardinal directions, Space to boost Up, Ctrl to boost Down. For your diplomatic convenience, the Sewage Launcher Railgun System has been provided with months of repurposed.... ammunition. Simply click the left-mouse button to fire.\u00a0 If the chase-drone camera is not to your liking, a much uglier cockpit view is available by hitting C and smooshing your face up to the front window.</p>\n<p>In the highly unlikely circumstance of a hostile encounter, please note that Hurtz is not responsible for any losses or damages to your person or personal property.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We know you have options for your space vacations, and we thank you for choosing us.</p>\n<p>- Note:\u00a0This is my submission to MaxParata's Voxel Galactix Jam.\u00a0 My first submission to anything. My first start-to-finish game, though it's not truly finished.
