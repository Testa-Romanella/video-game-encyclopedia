{"id": 65383, "slug": "time-de-tour", "name": "Time De Tour", "name_original": "Time De Tour", "description": "For every action, they say that a different universe is created.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat if an action was done a different way? Was never done at all?  These occurrences create an infinite amount of possibilities.  Possibilities waiting to be brought to life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTime DeTour presents a unique take on the Simulation Genre.  Instead of manipulating space (building objects, etc) you manipulate time.  By placing \"Sync Nodes\" at various points in time, you can spread your influence for good or for evil.  Different node types will let you affect events in the past and see their effects immediately as your decisions ripple through the future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nManage your time technology, choose the placement of your time nodes, and watch the future respond to your actions.  For better or worse, you are in charge in this simulation of mankind, Earth, and the universe itself.  Will you make the world a better place? Or worse?  With emergent gameplay elements combined in a world where events are intertwined, every action you make could have unforeseen repercussions.  Jump in, and take a tour of time.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b75688c101f79f236a419199b515d42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InVirtual Illusions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["InVirtual Illusions"], "esrb_rating": null}
