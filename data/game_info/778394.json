It looks like minecraft and plays like super mario world but slower and easyer. There just a couple Levels but ist very fun. Your Goal is to finish the levels and collect all diamonds. In the game is a guide that can help if you got problems and shows you the controls. There are also Gumbass form mario but he is firendly because you are steve not mario. Its your choice tho kill him or not.</p>\n<p>just try it out and listen to the minecraft music.
