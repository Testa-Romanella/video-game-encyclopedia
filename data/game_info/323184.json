However, you can opt to play in <strong>Amputee Mode</strong>, which lets you progress through the game with just one hand. Perfect if you're missing a hand, sipping a beer, or holding a baby.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: This game uses a special control scheme that requires an Xbox-style (X-input) gamepad with two joysticks. It cannot be played with a keyboard and mouse.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299b32c5a4fd3fc54f264257a7c6d8d7.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/NyZdpRa", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paul Bischoff"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Paul Bischoff"], "esrb_rating": null}
