You move your character with the D-pad and interact with objects/people with\u00a0the \"A\" button.\u00a0Press START to open the item menu.</p>\n<p>When you investigate an area, you'll shift to a first-person perspective. When that happens, just move the cursor around with the D-pad and interact with the environment by pressing the \"A\" button.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to save the game, just talk to Trail.</p>\n\r\n- DISCLAIMER -\r\n<p>This is a very short game I've made in less than a week to test GB Studio.\u00a0Please don't expect anything super-awesome. It's not.</p>\n<p>You can play the game on your browser or download the ROM and play it on original hardware/your favourite emulator.</p>\n<p>The are two endings\u00a0 and a couple of\u00a0 easter eggs. Nothing happens if you find'em, but you'd make me really happy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T06:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/2349b7568ee75787ed3f1ac6f6b7b6a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zapping Led"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
