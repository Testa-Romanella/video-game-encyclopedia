Each hybrid has its own unique stats and perks, and you test them against your friends in a natural-selection kind of way. There are millions of possibilities. Inlcudes 7 game-modes, plus a bunch of challenge maps, but I will be adding content whenever I can (hence, Early Access). You can add your own creatures, from whatever movie or game you can think of, and try morphing them with other animals! It supports that. Comes with online multiplayer &amp; creature-editor &amp; experimental mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-26T14:47:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538bd4d80856e36645e6bdc111eada01.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/AbstractSoftwareInc/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["FamishedMammal", "Abstract Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Abstract Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
