There is a pretty aggressive timer which you have to take into account, or you'll have to start over with a different set of tasks - absolutely doable, but you have to know what you are doing. And if you had enough of putting clothes on, taking them off, or playing with jiggling things there is a mystery to be solved as well - can't say more about that though, it wouldn't be a mystery otherwise!<br/><br/><strong>Features </strong>- why do You want to play?<br/><ul><li>Hand Physics which can interact with almost everything(the walls and some of the furniture stays, the rest is game)<br/></li><li>Realistic breast physics(yes!)<br/></li><li>Micro skin physics(meaning you can poke her let's say hand, and it will react to it!)<br/></li><li>Jello physics(this isn't some suggestive thing, I'm talking about actual jello)</li></ul><br/>The game is in the short but sweet territory, it's totally possible to finish it around 20 minutes(hence the super low base price), but this is something I always wanted to do so.. here we go.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e7f2f06ff444a00d5c6a9d8951dca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2SD"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2SD"], "esrb_rating": null}
