Try to collect al the \"berries\" (the red squares) without running into yourself.\u00a0Each berry you eat makes the snake longer, making the game just a little more difficult.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<em>wasd\u00a0</em>or the\u00a0<em>arrow-keys</em> to change the direction of the snake. Press the\u00a0<em>[P] key</em> or <em>left-click</em> to pause the game.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>This was my first ever HTML5 Canvas project. I made it back in early 2020, and I'm posting it now to test out itch.io's platform to see if it's something I'd like to utilize.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/129/12901ccf6e588103b4cdc0bef89b152a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Some-Antics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
