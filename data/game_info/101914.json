Development first started on the game in \r\n2003, though there have been several iterations. You play as Miguel \r\n\u201cMig\" Carter, a man of few means but great skill, who is rudely awakened\r\n by the apocalypse and is tasked with sorting it out. Thousands of \r\nrabbit-esque aliens are entering the Earth's atmosphere, and their \r\nnumbers keep increasing by the hour. Helping put a dent in their \r\npopulation is an assortment of more than 20 powerful weapons and hidden \r\nIlluminati devices. Featuring smooth, dynamic controls, 5 insanely \r\nvaried levels, a comprehensive New Game+ system and a great original \r\nsoundtrack, Mig's not going to let time nor space get in the way of \r\nbeing mankind's savior!\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\nI'm releasing this game free of charge and hope you enjoy it.
