All R18 scenes are optional, but included.\u00a0</strong><br/></p><p>Have you been playing cute moeroge games like Nekopara, Wanko to Kurosou, or Nekonin and thought to yourself: \"Why are there slaves everyone seems okay with, and where do they come from? How can I get my own?\"<br/><br/>Helix\u00a0Scientific is here to answer your (and my) call for cute cat people. For an exorbitant price you too can have your own\u00a0Felix\u2122, a lovable (f*ckable) humanoid cat of your very own. Grown from trademarked DNA entirely within their facility, you can rest assured they will come to you ignorant and naive of their place in society.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(=^\u2022.\u2022^=)</p>\n<p>Explore the inside of Helix Scientific with Addison, Pumpkin, and other lovable characters in this Work in Progress version of Helix Felix. This release covers a very abridged\u00a0 first arc of the story and gives you a taste of everyone's personality.\u00a0 You also get to see the main characters unblinking stare. I didn't realize Tyranobuilder doesn't have a auto-blink function. <br/><br/>Look forward to the Ren'py edition!</p>\n<p><strong>If you like the game, please consider supporting!</strong> I could use help by way of art (specifically GUI or background art), feedback, editing/proofreading, writing, coding, sharing with friends, animation, marketing, or wherever your talent lies! If you want to offer financial support instead, this is a Pay What You Want game.<strong>\u00a0Every little bit helps, thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a62d8934699661c28e3547d52ad5cb2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HelixFelix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
