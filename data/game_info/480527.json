You use a sword, or gun to destroy blocks to the beat.</p>\n<p>Levels are made up of blocks that denote the direction in which they are to be cut, or groups of blocks that are marked with the multiplier you receive for destroying them. When using the sword, make sure you use the cutting edge to get the most points.</p>\n<p>When using the gun, make sure your aim and timing is true. Challenge your friends and family for honors on your local leaderboard, and, when you are ready, take on the global leaderboards.</p>\n<p>The game ships with 14 songs and over 25 levels (with more planned in the future updates), but players can add their own songs to the game by creating levels using tools like mediocre mapper.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOM SONGS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Beat Bandit can import custom songs in ModSaber (Beat Saber) format! You can create your own levels using tools like mediocre mapper, or import custom songs created by the community.</p>\n<p>Create a directory in the \u201cMusic\u201d folder on your Oculus Go, and name the directory \u201cBeatBandit\u201d (The Directory structure is case-sensitive).</p>\r\nOpen the Music directory on your Oculus Go\r\nCreate a directory in the Music folder, and name it BeatBandit\r\n<p>Copy the custom song folders into this directory (\u201cMusic/BeatBandit\u201d) on your Oculus Go and start the game.</p>\n<p>Make sure you unzip the folder before copying it to this directory, and make sure the entire directory is copied.</p>\n<p>Once this is done, the songs you added should appear in the Custom Tab under the song list on the main menu.\u00a0<em>(Difficulty levels up-to \u201cExpert\u201d are supported.
