The equipment is not called equipment, but a magic weapon. You need to arrange the disciples in the array and let them participate in the battle.<br/>\r\nThe array can be upgraded to obtain random skill selection opportunities to match your disciples.<br/>\r\nDisciples have 8 qualities. The way to obtain them mainly depends on the spirit stone obtained by killing demons. Magic weapons also have 8 qualities, which are obtained by killing demons.<br/>\r\nThere are hundreds of attributes and skill entries in the game. The quality and attributes of disciples and magic weapons are random. Even the attributes of disciples and magic weapons under the same quality are random. Therefore, the magic weapon of low-level disciples is not necessarily worse than that of high-level disciples. Everything is full of random or random.<br/>\r\nPlayers need to start with low-level difficulty, collect magic weapons, draw high-quality disciples, and strengthen the initial attributes and state of the sect through the reincarnation power, so as to challenge higher-level difficulty.<br/>\r\nJust like the friendly tips in the game, when it comes to the survival of the race, the higher the chance of peerless Tianjiao.
