The crystal has been stolen by Sorceror Surtor, whom you must find and defeat. Explore a dungeon of 3 floors with many rooms, each containing treasure and monsters.</p>\n<p>This role playing game brings a sense of adventure and strategy, rather than fast-paced fighting. The controls are designed for ease of access and to prevent aches and pains:</p>\n<p>(1) Instead of continuously dragging the player, you can simply tap the position on screen to which he must move.</p>\n<p>(2) The number of controls has been minimized, so that all controls and interaction is in the playing screen. This makes them quickly accessible.</p>\n<p>Three floors containing hundreds of rooms with many treasures and monsters, provide hours of entertaining game play. Find and pick treasures (mostly weapons, ordinary and magical) to add to your inventory. Select from your inventory during combat attack and defense.</p>\n<p>The goal is to find and defeat Sorceror Surtor lurking in the 3rd (top) floor of the dungeon, retrieve the magical Crystal of Argentium from him and destroy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c17bcf8245c9829a719fcf784ef0880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixely"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
