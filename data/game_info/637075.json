I love low-res graphics in general, especially in horror games, so I has fun working with the limited resolution and color palette. I didn't follow the limitations of the Apple ii perfectly; this is most obvious by the fact that I used square pixels instead of those big, long, and rectangular pixels old computers would often have. If I ever expand this into a full project in the future, I would like for there to be a button that toggles the aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>I never made a game in less than 48 hours before, so I had to work really hard to get something out in time. This meant I cut some features that I wanted such as sound effects, accessibility features, and extra content that would make the game longer than it is now. Still, I'm proud of what I created. I learned a lot during the process, and I look forward to hearing what you think in the comments below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753e41915fcd256132e38b85320f6d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
