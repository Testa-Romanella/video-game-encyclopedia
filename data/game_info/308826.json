Once this is complete (about 75% done)\u00a0 the game's size will be hundreds of MB smaller, and songs can be distributed through a folder containing its data. Not only does this allow for great customization , you dont need to have songs that you know you wont play eating up your disk space. Also user-generated content is always just great.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b80f2bbc6e45dd9879ef9fc18ff93e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stoozey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
