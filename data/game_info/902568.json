Obviously, there are no more caterpillars in game, so i renamed it \"Hadi\" (Snakes). It was fun project to make. This game is meant to be played with friends or family, gather them and have fun. Play it at your own risk ... rage\u00a0guaranteed! :D</p>\n<p>How to play: Use keyboard keys to control snakes. You can also burrow (if you collect 5 food) to avoid obstacles (use key for opposite direction than you are facing).</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing...</p>\n<p>Music by: Eggy Toast</p>\n<p>Engine used: Godot 4.0 (beta 5-9)</p>\n<p>There are (Godot) problems in some browsers.
