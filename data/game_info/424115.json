The difficulty of the computer opponent can also be adjusted using the dropdown menu below the computer controlled toggle.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Place icons by clicking on the fields</li><li>Switch icons by clicking\u00a0the icon next to your score</li><li>Restart using the button in the bottom left or by pressing R</li><li>Restarting also changes the colour palette</li><li>Mute the music by pressing M</li></ul>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>In my country tic-tac-toe is called butter, cheese and eggs. The coin flip adds a component of luck. So, the title is a combination of\u00a0these two aspects. The idea of the game came from someone who remarked that his game was basically tic-tac-toe, but you could take\u00a0an opponent's spot. This actually seemed pretty interesting to me; resulting in the creation of\u00a0this game.</p>\n<p>The music in the game\u00a0was made by\u00a0Marching Dream.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 13 hours</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/602b84843cb85b3ab79b209b27a7e6df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
