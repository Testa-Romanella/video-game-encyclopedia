The releases published on here are considered very early alpha builds.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tiny Life is a fun simulation game that tries to capture the essence of games like The Sims, but in an isometric pixelart style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game, you control a set of people that live together in a household. You take care of their daily needs, build their skills, forge new relationships... or just mess\u00a0up their entire life in whatever way you can think of!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The controls are mostly pretty simple, however, there are some features that are currently only available through keybinds. Most notably:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold the Control key to delete stuff (For this, you need to be in the right mode. Deleting furniture only works while in the furniture mode, for example.)</li><li>Press the\u00a0R key to rotate furniture</li><li>The game saves automatically every few seconds as well as when you quit using the close button in the corner of the window.</li></ul>\r\nIssues\r\n<p>If you find any issues (which there will probably be a lot of early on), you can report them either in the comments down below or in my Discord server.</p>\n<p>If anything unusual happens or the game closes down completely, be sure to include the log file which can be found in the \"Tiny Life\" folder in your Documents folder on Windows, or your home folder on Linux and Mac. To make debugging a little easier for me, you can also include your save file, which can be found in the same location.</p>Cheats<p>Since the game is early in development, there are a lot of things you can't do yet. To combat this issue, you can open up a cheat menu by pressing the F1 key. Here are some of the more useful cheats:</p><ul><li>ShowNonBuyable allows you to buy plates, pots and the like</li><li>NoNeed stops need reduction in all people</li><li>EditWorld allows you to place things outside of lots</li><li>Needless restores the current person's needs fully</li><li>EditPerson opens a character editor with all functionality enabled</li><li>Gib gives you $10000</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T02:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1b7b6033d932eb9f546b0a67e421ca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ellpeck"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
