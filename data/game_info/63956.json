{"id": 63956, "slug": "bitsy-bits", "name": "Bitsy Bits", "name_original": "Bitsy Bits", "description": "Bitsy Bits, a game about a fun loving magical mouse named Bitsy who must defend Magic Land from the dictator Twinkle Twinkle who has cast a spell of Wickedness on the people. This causes the people to do bad things under the influence of Twinkle Twinkle's rule. Bitsy Bits is the only one immune to the spell. Bitsy must use her magic to transport the people to safety so that they are far enough away from Twinkle, who resides in his castle, so as to not be affected by the wicked spell. Collecting Master Bits at the end of levels clears that area of all wickedness, and collecting a Master Bit in Twinkle's castles clears the castle of wickedness, in which Twinkle must now retreat to one of his other castles in order to continue ruling with concentration on his spell. Twinkle uses the power of the Master Bits to power his magic, giving most Master Bits a blue color. As a result, Twinkle has thought of this ahead of time, building his castles around the Master Bits so that they're inside the top floor of each castle rather than outside and above it, making the only path to the Master Bit difficult as Bitsy must climb each castle with floor after floor of devastating challenges to activate the Master Bits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Bitsy Blocks, you control 4 separate individual objects (usually in the form of block assets from levels found in the game this time around). These objects are dis-connected from each other and are not one shape but rather independent objects that fall together, move together, and shuffle together. But when an object touches another object due to gravity, the player loses control of those objects and they continue to fall with gravity. Match 3 of the same object in a row to clear those objects. However, no matter how hard you try, you cannot win, only lose at this game. The highest score is the best score.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Bitsy Shuffle, you control a square on a board that is capable of moving other objects on the board along its 4 directional compass. Instead of the objects falling off the board, they are transported to the other side instead. Match 3 of the same object in a row to clear those objects. However, no matter how hard you fail, you cannot lose, only win at this game. The lowest score is the best score.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nController Support<br/>\r\nWindows version supports the XboxOne pc controller.
