This was my 2nd ever jam so I'm still learning how to scope for game jams (and games in general!).</p>\n<p>As such, the end product ended up buggier and less complete than I'd wish for, including a horrible spawn-the-boss-out-of-play bug which you miiight be able to get around only if you get to the highest building at the back and look high and left into\u00a0the distance but basically I don't expect anyone to get a victory in this version which sucks because I was quite stoked about the victory cinematic and the music (Bulletproof) that accompanied it.</p>\n<p>Further still, as luck would have it, the hard drive with everything related to this project bricked itself just a day after submission and me being the idiot I am, ignored version control (which is so not me, I version control everything, except this one,\u00a0can you believe it?!)... Sadly this means I can't\u00a0work any further on this project to bring it to the level I envisioned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, I\u00a0really hope it can bring some joy into your life for a few minutes :')</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T08:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c647bda04c76eb6fdb7012d853f351e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ReadyGo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
