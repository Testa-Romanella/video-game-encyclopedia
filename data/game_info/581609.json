Collect Gold, Crowns, Rings and more to buy supplies and reinforcements, upgrade your Queen, and change modifiers that effect your play-through experience, so that each run is a little different from the last.</p>\n<p>Use your chess pieces wisely to protect The Queen and get her to The Witch Doctor to break the spell that is causing her to move and act with seemingly random intent.\u00a0 Doing so will let you regain control of your Queen and find out just how powerful she's become on this journey!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>*Disclaimer*\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game is in a very early stage of development. We have released a demo that includes a very limited scope of our overall vision for A Queen's Tale. As the development progresses we will continue to update this page with more current builds. Please take this journey with us, as we build upon this project. Play our newest build releases here and leave us some feedback, so we know where to look for improvements, and where the strengths in our game already are.
