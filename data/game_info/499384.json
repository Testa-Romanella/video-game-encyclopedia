Her existence was a simple one, observing the people who lived there and scaring off the birds. Even when the people had gone and the farm was left barren, she had no wants or needs. How could she?</p>\n<p>After countless years of not seeing another soul, a strange woman shows up and gives the scarecrow newfound life. The woman tells her that she has a task for her: grow some plants, and in exchange, she'll free her from the farm. Fail, and she'll go back to being a normal scarecrow.</p>\n<p>Scarecrow tends to the plants as directed, unsure of what else to do, and spends her nights walking aimlessly. In time, she meets a kind lion and a mischievous rabbit that bring companionship to her empty days. Maybe this new situation isn't so bad after all?</p>\n<p>But the plants are growing a little too well, becoming a bit too lively... Scarecrow can only wonder what this feeling is inside of her that's telling her to run.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 GxG route!</li><li>7 CGs total (4 Mini CGs)</li><li>4 Endings</li><li>16.2k Words</li><li>Original Soundtrack</li><li>Original, Dynamic Background Art</li><li>Voice Effects</li><li>Font Toggle</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>- - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u26a0\ufe0f CONTENT WARNING:</strong>\u00a0ANIMAL DEATH, BODY HORROR\u00a0<strong>\u26a0\ufe0f</strong></p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -</p>\n\n<p><strong>Voice Talents</strong></p>\n<p>Scarecrow, Amara |\u00a0TtalgiMaru</p>\n<p>Noel, Yves | Kettako</p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p><strong>Concept &amp; Art Direction\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0Nucius,\u00a0xxmissarichanxx</p>\n<p><strong>Story &amp; Writing\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0Tabby Wright</p>\n<p><strong>Sprite Art, GUI, Proofreading\u00a0</strong>| xxmissarichanxx</p>\n<p><strong>CG &amp; Background Art </strong>| Nico, Nucius</p>\n<p><strong>Promo Art\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0Nucius, xxmissarichanxx</p>\n<p><strong>Music &amp;\u00a0Sound Effects\u00a0</strong>| Kettako,\u00a0Omniboss</p>\n<p><strong>Programming\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0Speck</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FULL CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f92888dd2df9e3468a5736e6bd4ae1af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["xxmissarichanxx", "omelette", "TabbbyWright", "Studio Calamari", "Nucius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
