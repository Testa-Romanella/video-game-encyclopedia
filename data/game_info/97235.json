If you are reading this, it's because you\u2019ve been chosen - handpicked from among the trillions of lifeforms struggling to survive across the galaxy. We\u2019ve been watching you. We\u2019ve seen you face terrible things. We\u2019ve seen your strength tested, time and again, and we\u2019ve seen you prevail. Your light still burns, despite the darkness that surrounds it. You are inspiration itself, and you are needed once more.</p>\n<p>Look down. No, not at the ground beneath you. Down within yourself. Further. Beneath the roots, way, way down through the layers of what was, past the golden stove, and even deeper than darkness\u2026. There. There you are, in the belly of the universe, your new home, Hara. This road will not be easy, and many challenges await you. But never fear! You have been bestowed with great power, magic, and abilities beyond limits. We did not give you these blessings, and they are not gifts. You brought them with you, for they have always been there. </p>\n<p>This book is a companion guide for adventures exploring the Champions of Hara tabletop board game. Beneath the Roots: Lore &amp; Art from the World Hara \u00a0is a compendium of the many faces that reside in the vast realms of Hara, the paths these travellers have walked, and the landscapes they\u2019ve helped to shape.
