Try not to get too hungry while playing because it's what they want!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Use your vacuum! :</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your left hand contains a vacuum that can suck up any object on the counter and tables. These items are then stored to be used as ammo for your right arm cannon! Figure out which item does the most damage to each enemy to get the upper hand!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mayhem\u00a0for Breakfast!!!! :</strong></em></p>\n<p>It's not a shooter without enemies! And lucky for you, the customer is always right!</p>\n<p>At the start of every wave, use the multiple menus that are spawned across the counters to pick and choose the enemies you want to spawn in the upcoming wave. You must order up to the maximum amount that the queue wants for that round in order to start that wave, and the maximum amount increasing the more you progress into the game, so be sure to have a game plan by checking what items are currently surrounding you before you make a final decision!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move that body... literally! :</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Use your surrounds! Point at any of the green pads\u00a0and press the right grip on your\u00a0controller to move to that area of the level! Don't forget to duck and dodge when you can to avoid any fries or milkshake cream coming your way!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Trigger:</strong> Turn on/off vacuum</p>\n<p><strong>Right Trigger:</strong> Shoot out ammo</p>\n<p><strong>Right Grip: </strong>Teleport to a given green pad<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Tobey-Julian Joseph: Project Management (Game Design, etc.), Lead Programmer, Source Control</li><li>David Wu: Programmer, 3D Modeler, Lead Level Design, Source Control\r\n</li><li>Tariq Thomas: Lead Modeler, Character Design</li><li>Adam Brochu: Lead 2D Artist (UI, HUD, Textures), Level Design\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/35466afd63dad77364d9c4b2c8588ab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Calzones", "dwu3", "Tariq Thomas", "Adam Brochu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
