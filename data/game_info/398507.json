It sounds fun, doesn't it? Well your innocent self is going to put up with hell when someone dares you to play \"Bloody Mary\". At first, you don't believe that ghosts are real. Well, things are going to get very real for you and scary....\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get prepared to try to escape the house with Bloody Mary roaming around it.
