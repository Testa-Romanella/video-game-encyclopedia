I added multiple changes such as changing speeds for individual shooters and chasers, adding a new challenge which is instead of killing just the ones that first appear, you kill a certain number of them on each level. This also makes the level harder. I also made it so that the fire rate gets slower as you go up the levels for even more of a challenge. I made the Main Menu a bit different as well. Another thing that changes is how fast the spawners spawn the enemies.\u00a0I hope you enjoy!</p><p>The last level is the hardest if you're up for it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T10:23:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d60debbe05a742959fd168a2ccb4d50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Roshan27"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
