{"id": 820693, "slug": "death-warden", "name": "Death Warden", "name_original": "Death Warden", "description": "<p>Death Warden is a hybrid of survival horror and retro fps elements.\u00a0 It was made for the GMKT 2022 game jam.\u00a0 It includes a Blackjack minigame where you can gamble with your supplies.\u00a0 Do you play it safe?\u00a0 Or do you put it all on the line for a big payout of shells for your shotgun?</p>\r\nBLACKJACK MINIGAME:\r\n<p>To play blackjack, walk up to the robed figure in the starting room and press the space bar.\u00a0 You can then select your wager.\u00a0 In blackjack you want to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.\u00a0 Both you and the dealer get two cards to start with, but the dealer's second card is hidden.\u00a0 Aces are worth either 1 or 11, Jacks Queens and Kings are worth 10, number cards are worth their number.\u00a0 If your first two cards equal 21 you get a blackjack and win twice as much as you bet. The dealer can also get a blackjack which will instantly lose you that game, unless you also have 21, which results in a 'push' (no one wins, you take your bet back).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>On your turn you may either 'hit', 'stay', or 'double down'.\u00a0 Selecting stay will end your turn and the dealer's turn will begin.\u00a0 Selecting hit will give you another card, but if you go over 21 then you will lose automatically.\u00a0 Selecting double down will only be available before you receive your first card and if you have enough items to do so.\u00a0 It will double your bet and give you only one more card then the dealer's turn begins.</p>\n<p>On the dealer's turn, he will draw cards until his hand is worth 17 or more.\u00a0 If he has over 17 he will stay.\u00a0 You will automatically win if he goes over 21.\u00a0 If he stayed, then the game is over and your hand values are compared.\u00a0 Highest wins.\u00a0 If the value is equal the it is a 'push'.\u00a0 If you win, then you get paid an amount equal to your initial bet.\u00a0 (For example, if you bet 2 pistol rounds and 1 shotgun shell you will win 2 pistols and 1 shotgun shell.\u00a0 If that was all you had in inventory, then your inventory will now be 4 pistol rounds 2 shotgun shells)</p>\r\nSTORY:\r\n<p>In classic retro fps fashion, the game will not explain anything about what's going on.\u00a0 If you are interested in knowing, here's what I had in mind.</p>\n<p>You are a Death Warden, sworn to the service of Irmo, the Goddess of Death herself.\u00a0 Its your sacred duty to destroy the undead.\u00a0 One day, you awake in a strange location.\u00a0 You do not know where it is, but there is a robed figure who claims to be a friend to you.\u00a0 He claims to be a servant of the God of Commerce (and gambling).\u00a0 To ease your concerns he handed you a pistol and a shotgun along with some ammo.\u00a0 He is also offering the chance to win more supplies by playing blackjack with him.\u00a0 He says the area beyond in infested with a necromancers experiments to create more powerful undead warriors.</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>This was a solo project, but the music and some graphics were acquired online.\u00a0 I also feel like I should mention since it is for a game jam that some of the code for the shooting mechanics and enemy ai is recycled from a project I abandoned in 2018.\u00a0</p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>There are three songs from TeknoAxe (http://teknoaxe.com/Home.php)</p>\n<p>Burning Victory (http://teknoaxe.com/Link_Code_3.php?q=369)<br/></p>\n<p>Whispers_of_the_Fallen (http://teknoaxe.com/Link_Code_3.php?q=1850)</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Knife Party (http://teknoaxe.com/Link_Code_3.php?q=849)</p>\r\nVisual Assets:\r\n<p>The 3d environment models come from Quaternius\u00a0(https://quaternius.com/), Specifically the dungeon pack (https://quaternius.com/packs/modulardungeon.html)</p>\n<p>The dealer's sprite is from rehcub on OpenGameArt (https://opengameart.org/content/2d-character-monk)</p>\n<p>The enemy sprites, shotgun ammo pickup, potion bottle, and the sprites for the light sources all come from Nmn on OpenGameArt (https://opengameart.org/users/nmn)</p>\n<p>The sprites for the cards are from\u00a0https://game-icons.net/\u00a0all made by:\u00a0aussiesim</p>\n<p>The font is called Veteran Typewriter (https://www.dafont.com/veteran-typewriter.font)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f88bad16245941b8b035f6be7bf49f27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CV33Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
