He does not feel like to belong here. Controlled by the native clan of elves, everything in the forest tries to repel him. When he comes to a village, all the villagers glower at him, which makes him uncomfortable. He couldn't pass the village until disguises himself as a native using the magical fan. For generations, the native clans take control of the dark forest. They set all kinds of deadly obstacles that only they can pass easily. The traveling elf tries his best reaching out to get help, but nobody cares. He feels the natives are indifferent to him. He can hardly bear the hostilities filled in the atmosphere and feels deeply lost.</p>\n<p>Development Details</p>\n<p>THE SHAN is a short 2D platform adventure game. I created it during the first semester of my master's degree with 3 other team members. It symbolized the feeling of being isolated or excluded. <strong>Feel free to play.</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard Settings</p>\n<p>A - move left</p>\n<p>D - move right</p>\n<p>U - throw a fan</p>\n<p>I - stop fans</p>\n<p>O - teleport to a fan</p>\n<p>Y - Use a fan to cover your face</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dda147ea89bb21bd3b494cf67141a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["monachen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
