It's essentially my own take at a maze generation algorithm. The way it works is first there are 2 \"seed\" walls randomly placed in the maze, then the game iterates through all the units of the maze (each wall and floor) and checks each unit's surroundings. If there is more than 0 yet less than 3 walls that touch the unit, a wall will be created. The output of this maze is similar to Binary tree algorithm but a bit more flawed with bias around the edges of the maze. It is interesting to note that the maze algorithm works best for mazes that are less than 300 units squared. You can also edit your maze fully with a build and destroy mode as well as walk around it in 3rd person view.</p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>This game is an ever expandable sandbox and you can make your maze as big as you want (although I highly don't recommend going above 100, 000 units squared unless you build PCs for NASA). In order to set a maze size hit the \"ESC\" key and input a value for the rows and columns, next hit confirm and you've got your very own unique maze which you can edit any way you want. Now to add or remove the walls or even build vertically you want to press the \"N\" key for Build mode and \"M\" for Destroy mode. To reset your maze just press \"SPACE\" and you'll respawn in a new maze.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>ESC - Menu</li><li>N - Build Mode Switch</li><li>M - Destroy Mode Switch</li><li>SPACE - Regenerate Maze</li><li>WASD or Arrow Keys - Move Player/Camera</li><li>Scroll Wheel - Camera Zoom In/Out</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Soundtrack - \"Uniq - Art of Silence\" is under a Royalty Free music license.
