Chichester 2 trilogy.</p>\n<p>Taking place on the second day of the protagonist's holiday, who wakes up with a nasty headache, which is not helped by the presence of the protagonist's nemesis - the megalomaniacal, kleptomaniac and cake mix loving Grendel Jinx.

Eventually coming to a very undesirable conclusion, the protagonist's secretary is tasked with finding out whether the conclusion is correct or not.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Grendel gets news that her bodyguards have been killed, and with all evidence pointing to the protagonist, she sets out for revenge.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3b662f0715b5af18a79762802efa65e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["triority_developer@outlook.com"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
