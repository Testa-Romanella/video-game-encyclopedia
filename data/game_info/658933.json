{"id": 658933, "slug": "dance-of-the-baby-lord", "name": "Dance of the Baby Lord", "name_original": "Dance of the Baby Lord", "description": "<p>Dance of the Baby Lord provides the player with unique power-ups dropped from enemy weapons to enhance their dancing skills that are controlled by the player\u2019s force field strength, a laser gun, for example, drops a power-up giving the player the ability to deflect enemies bullets. Most of the power-ups are timed and limited to balance the gameplay, whether they are beginners or intermediate.</p>\n<p>One of our main gameplay features is that the player\u2019s force field strength will increase or decrease depending on how many arrows were hit or missed. The more arrows the player hits, the further enemies are pushed off to the edge of the cliff, they\u2019re dead when they fall off it.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Player's main objective is to survive while trying to push the enemy off the cliff. Players will soon notice that after a couple of enemies different types of enemies are spawning and power-ups start to drop and beating enemies start to either get tougher or easier. The player's main goal is to beat the boss of the game, the Baby Lord.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80debe02c05f580a8e559f0ec8bf4796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["myoussef9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
