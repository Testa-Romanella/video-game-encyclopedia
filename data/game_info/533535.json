Very early prototype. Controls are as follows:</p>\n<p>Movement</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>W and S to control torque along pitch axis</p>\n<p>A and D to control torque along yaw axis</p>\n<p>Q and E to control torque along roll axis</p>\n<p>Holding shift in conjunction with any of these will cause the ship to decelerate and eventually come to a stop on that axis of rotation. This is useful for coming to a dead stop as it is quite difficult to do that by hand using the opposite torque key. For example, instead of using W then S to try and stop, doing W then Shift+W or Shift+S will work better. Be sure to release the torque key before shift or else you will impart angular velocity again.</p>\n<p>Space to thrust forwards</p>\n\n<p>Shooting</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>Use the crosshair to aim (note that the lasers have a limited range of adjustment denoted by the large red circle, if you aim outside of this area, the lasers will aim at the true crosshair represented as the small red circle; this sounds complicated but it's quite intuitive in game)</p>\n<p>Left click to shoot</p>\n\n<p>Debugging</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>The game will be first person only, but for now there is a fixed third person camera as well. Up arrow activates first person camera, down arrow activates fixed third person camera.</p>\n<p>Escape reloads the scene</p>\n\n<p>Misc Stuff</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>Currently there are just 5 targets, 2 moving and 3 stationary. These each take 1 second of fire before disappearing. Hitting any of them will destroy your ship and you will have to reload the scene with escape. There are red trackers following each target that will help you see them even at far distances.</p>\n\n<p>There's currently a lack of any reference points, but asteroids will be added soon so that players will have a better sense of speed. Additionally, due to 32 bit floats being used in the physics system, going farther than ~10km from the origin will result in jittery physics. Eventually the world will be limited with a border.</p>\n\n<p>My current plans are to make this game multiplayer, but that may change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e52fed3ad4243c0e4ae0985eee69ebb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StormFalcon32"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
