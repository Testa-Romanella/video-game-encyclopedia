Heroes and peasants from the local village keep breaking in and attacking him!</p>\n<p>To protect yourself, you must place towers in the field outside your dungeon and quickly find all the ingredients needed to begin the end of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that's not all - because Evil-ish combines Tower Defence with Dungeon Crawling, when an enemy gets past your towers it's not game over - they'll appear inside your dungeon you'll need to take them on yourself!</p>\n<p>Defeating enemies yourself may also reward you with cards used to upgrade your towers outside - or even add new ones!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game that combines tower defence and dungeon crawling!</p>\n<p>-------------</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>TrolledWoods#2954 as Unity Programmer</p>\n<p>Radu#9484 as Unity Programmer &amp; Level Designer<br/></p>\n<p>idln#8625 as 2D Pixel Artist &amp; Animations<br/></p>\n<p>Zani Le Psy#8333 as Music Composer and Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Rolf#0208 as Music Composer and Sound Designer</p>\n<p>WestyDesign AKA SquidGeneral10#4090 as Team Lead &amp; 2D Pixel Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c80c1649c56a6b5de7b8f5e1944e098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrolledWoods", "Troube", "WestyDesign", "Zanilis", "idln"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
