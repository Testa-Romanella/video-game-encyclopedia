The player has to escape the board. The board can be rotated 90 degrees to the left or to the right or upside down. Upon rotation, all falling blocks fall down according to the new direction of gravity. The player can then jump up the blocks and escape the room, or he might have to rotate the board again. Also there are blocks that don't fall and doors to make the levels harder.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T10:32:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9be/9be3033227d76ed4c2767bf50d8dc3bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Wojciech Malinowski"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Wojciech Malinowski"], "esrb_rating": null}
