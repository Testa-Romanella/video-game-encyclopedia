It\u2019s the first in a trilogy of games with each edition opting for a different style of gameplay throughout the series. You play as Popolon and your Mission is to rescue Aphrodite from the clutches of the evil Prince of Darkness. You have to fight your way through 8 levels of enemies and bosses along the way to rescue the Goddess of Love and Beauty. The action takes place in the form of a top-down vertical scrolling shoot\u2019em up style including various power-ups along the way.</p>\n<p>The Amiga port contains the follow features..\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Original game fully disassembled to ensure accurate gameplay\r\n</li><li>All graphics remastered by Toni Galvez\r\n</li><li>Brand new title and loading screens\r\n</li><li>High quality Amiga Enhanced Sound Effects\r\n</li><li>All levels and bosses have unique Amiga Enhanced soundtracks\r\n</li><li>All new Hi-score table with automatic saving to disk\r\n</li><li>50hz / 60hz gameplay option\r\n</li><li>Built-in auto-fire\r\n</li><li>Additional secret bonus power-up added ( can you find it? )\r\n</li><li>Compatible with all Amigas running 512k chip and 512k other ram\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Q: What are the Amiga system requirements?<br/>A: Any OCS / ECS Amiga with 512k chip RAM and 512k of other RAM. Please note however if playing on NSTC or 60hz it is recommended to have some proper fast ram or a slightly faster processor as there are some areas which experience slow-down otherwise.</p>\n<p>Q: How do I run it?<br/>A: The game comes as an ADF file so either write it to floppy disk, mount it on a Gotek ( other drive emulators are available). If you don\u2019t own an Amiga then you can boot the ADF in any popular emulator such as WinUAE or FS-UAE.\r\n</p>\n<p>Q: Can it be installed to hard drive?<br/>A: Not yet but a WHDLoad installer will be coming soon\r\n</p>\n<p>Q: How long did it take to make?<br/>A: The project started in July 2021 and finished in January 2022.\r\n</p>\n<p>Q: Why did you pick Knightmare to port?<br/>A: It was an accident. After Metal Gear I was interested in the disassembly process so I picked Knightmare because it\u2019s a 32K ROM which doesn\u2019t do any bank switching but is also a fun game. That process went incredibly well and when speaking with my friend Toni Galvez he said he would love to remaster the graphics into 32 colours and now.. here we are.</p>\n<p>Q: I would like to support you?<br/>A: Awesome, then please consider buying the soundtrack from here..\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://hoffman.bandcamp.com/album/knightmare-amiga-ost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec09b635063c9d4d535980a302db8e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoffman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
