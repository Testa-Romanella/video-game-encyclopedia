I made this game in 5 days for the Tenjam. The reason I had 5 days is because I joined 2 days late. Participating to the gamejam was amazing and I really enjoyed working on my game. I learned many new things while participating to this gamejam. I really want to improve this game to make it an actual game because now it only has 3 levels.\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>A - move right\r\n</p>\n<p>D - move left\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump - spacebar\r\n</p>\n<p>Click - shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>Drop a weapon - Q\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All sprites in this game are made by me except for the guns.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing or took a look at this page!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e015955c8c1dea457d4dee8e162022c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Djedendev"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
