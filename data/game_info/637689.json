{"id": 637689, "slug": "teamfight-without-tactics", "name": "Teamfight without Tactics", "name_original": "Teamfight without Tactics", "description": "<p><em>Teamfight without Tactics</em> is a simple turn-based strategy game where your goal is to defeat endless waves of enemies using powerful pawns. Every turn, each pawn has access to three randomly chosen abilities, which are reset at the end of the turn and renewed on the next turn. Enemies are getting stronger each wave - how long will you survive?</p><p><strong>How to play</strong></p><p>You control white units. Red units are the enemies that you have to defeat. The game spawns waves of enemies endlessly.\u00a0Every unit on the board has its turn. The turn queue is shown in the upper part of the screen.<br/></p><p>When your unit begins their turn, it is shown as the first one in the queue and available basic moves are highlighted on the grid. You and your enemies\u00a0have 3 Action Points each turn. You can spend them by either moving one tile in any cardinal direction (1 AP), attack an enemy next to you in any cardinal direction (1 AP), or using an ability on the lower left of the screen\u00a0(1-3 AP). Hovering an ability tells you what it does, and clicking it selects it to use, highlighting tiles that you can use it on. To use it, simply click on a tile. The turn ends when you spend all AP or pass.</p><p>When all enemies are slain, the next wave is spawned with slightly stronger enemies than in the previous wave, and all your units are fully healed.</p><p>Abilities scale with your attributes - Strength (damage dealt), Focus (ability power) and Agility (movement).</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>WASD - move camera</p><p>Hold scroll - rotate camera</p><p><strong>GJL Game Parade Summer 2021</strong><br/></p><p>This game has been created and submitted for the\u00a0GJL Game Parade Summer 2021 game jam.
