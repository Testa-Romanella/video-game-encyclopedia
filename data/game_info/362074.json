The update will automatically restart your computer in only one minute and you have not saved anything for at least an hour. Hurry up and stop the update, but with time running out quickly and a not so user-friendly interface that is easier said than done.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>What you need to do is written in the lower-left corner. At any time you only need to use the Space, Enter, and arrow keys. If you play the downloaded version you close the game with Escape.</p>\n<p><strong>Fullscreen<br/></strong>The game is absolutely best played in full screen with sounds on.</p>\n<p><strong>Team<br/></strong>I did this Game Jam alone.
