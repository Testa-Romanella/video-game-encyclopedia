Finding all the characters in those levels is barely scratching the surface. You play, you win, you change, you play, you win, you change, you play\u00a0- you play until you have found the fastest or easiest or highest-scoring path with the characters that feel the best on that path. And then you play again because there's still more to perfect.</p>\n<ul><li>50+ unique characters to play</li><li>branching paths</li><li>5-minute play sessions</li></ul><p>(If you have seen me on Twitter, you may have seen some features [new character select screen, alternate early levels] that are still being refined.
