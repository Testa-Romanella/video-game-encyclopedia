The game is top down, similar to Hotline Miami, however doubles up as a rhythm game.</p>\n<p>The player is encouraged to fire their gun only on the beat, as the weapon does drastically increased damage on the beat, granting the ability to 1-shot all enemies, as opposed to the regular 3 or 4 shots required.</p>\n<p>The game was made using Processing, and unfortunately is poorly optimised, not running exceptionally well. However it proves to be a good proof of concept if nothing else.</p>\n<p>Music was made by the talented Avelina Kyriacou</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:55:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/340/340b18f45b931d9ba41af2e37298b51b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steeley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
