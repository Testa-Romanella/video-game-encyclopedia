The heterochromatic dog sees it as his/her duty to the underworld to collect human souls (really just Harpastum balls). The people fear the guard dog of the Underworld and take up arms to chase away Cerberus from their villages and children. The villagers mistake Alex for the real thing and chases the dog through the countryside, though with Alex\u2019s carefree personality he/she will never notice. To him/her they are a fan group and are just cheering Alex on as he/she collects Harpastum balls and power-ups to become the real Cerberus. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0705d14a09de0743ecd32be72531fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lydechaser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
