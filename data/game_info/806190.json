It was made as a thesis project, and was largely well received by the reviewers. The goal was to create a game based on assets that were either made by the author, or adopted from public domain for his needs. The art style can be described as retro, pixel art and lowpoly.</p>\n<p>The plot follows a young man trying to save his ill mother by finding a rare flower deep in the dark caverns. His challenges include puzzles, exploration in the dark and defending himself from cruel monsters.</p>\n<p>The game is playable in English and Polish, and it's possible to run it with an experimental texture displacement function, which can add more depth, although can look warped.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T21:03:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce35c2b94d047f7eb50545450eef6121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jakub Majewski"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
