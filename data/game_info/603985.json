Run straight at the enemy if you want, but don't be surprised if they've laid a trap.<br/>Cavalry, swordsmen, spearmen and archers need to be placed strategically on the field or they will be wiped out before you know it.<br/>Running wildly at the enemy is a recipe for destruction.<br/><br/>And don't think you can just steamroll the map. Religious and ethnic differences mean rebellions are always in the air.<br/>Spend your time to convert assimilate your subjects or expect a dagger in your back.<br/><br/>Every world-map and battlefield is entirely procedurally generated, so this game will always have something to throw at you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T02:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd150e9546740fe1217b305d4ce9135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aserisoft"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aserisoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
