As you provide the girls with the requested flowers you get to see the cute litle story of 2 Touhou love birds unfold.</p>\n<p>This is a Touhou Project fangame made for the submission of the Touhou Pride Jam 2. It is made in 2 weeks so there is not a lot to it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Touhou Project original concept, characters, and other elements are the property of ZUN and Team Shanghai Alice. This game is a fan made work and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original creators.
