Among others we can highlight:<br/>-Improve their capacity for observation, analysis, concentration and attention. Exercise their visual memory: Kids must remember the initial image of the puzzle to know where to place the pieces later.<br/><br/>-Help to identify and establish relationships between shapes and silhouettes, improving spatial and visual perception.<br/><br/>-Exercise fine motor skills to move the pieces with their fingers.<br/>In addition, Edujoy's educational puzzles offer positive reinforcement with cheerful animations when the child completes the puzzle correctly, to help them increase their self-esteem.<br/><br/>Our recommendation is to start with puzzles with fewer pieces and gradually increase the number so that the child is motivated and facing new challenges with greater security and confidence.<br/><br/>EDUJOY EDUCATIONAL GAMES <br/><br/>We love creating educational and fun games for you.
