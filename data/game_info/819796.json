Roll around the city, explore the quirky physics, try to knock down the cones that are hidden across the level and then make your way to the Dice Cassino (not that there is anything going on there)!\u00a0 But wait, there is a twist.. Every time you roll a number, the physical properties of your dice chance, so you have to learn how to use them to achieve your objectives!</p>\n<p>We didn't really have time to add the objectives to the game.. We faced a lot of issues during this jam, but it ended up as a funny cute little toy to play around with :D</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the<strong> mouse left click</strong> to start aiming and <strong>click again</strong> to fling the dice in that direction.</p>\n<p>Holding the<strong> right mouse button</strong> allows you to rotate the camera.</p>\n<p>Press <strong>backspace</strong> to reset the dice position if you get stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art: Booter (https://bootswithfur.itch.io/) and Sirius (https://siriusvictoria.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Design/Leading: V\u00edtorM (https://kaovhmf.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>SFX: BravoDS (https://itch.io/profile/bravods)</p>\n<p>Music: Lucy Phillips (https://itch.io/profile/lucydoesmusic)</p>\n<p>Programming/IT stuff: LurkNautili (https://itch.io/profile/lurknautili)</p>\n<p>The initial concept of the game (and the entire development, to be honest) was very collaborative.
