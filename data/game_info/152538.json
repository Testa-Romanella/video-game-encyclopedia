Will add in the arrow key movement controls after the jam!</p><p>You are the solve inhabitant of asteroid B-612. The soil of your home is infested with baobab seeds. You must destroy the plants soon after they sprout, for once the trees grow, you can never get rid of them.</p>\n<p>Inspired by The Little Prince by\u00a0\u00a0Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Asteroid B-612 is a game that, much like life, can be frustrating and\u00a0cannot be won but does have an end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Asteroid B-612\u00a0was created by a solo developer\u00a0for the 2 Colors Game Jam. All design, code, and visuals were created by me\u00a0during the 48 hour\u00a0jam time. The background music\u00a0was made by\u00a0shortiefoeva2.\u00a0As per the jam requirements, only two colors were used. The colors are\u00a0#223147 and\u00a0#C5C8E7.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09ec33049fcab88ed1790294b9425325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scientistsarepeopletoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
