Over time the enemies get stronger and grow in numbers, but you also get stronger along the way. Currently you must restart the game to redesign the gun, but in future you should be able to redesign at any time.</p>\n<p>To start, draw your gun using the canvas tools, then click on the bullet/hold points to pick them up and put them where you want on the gun.\u00a0 Red arrow is bullet point, green is hold point.
