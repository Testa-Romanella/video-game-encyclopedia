Each snake is linked together as your inputs control all the snakes at once. If you go off the edge of the screen you will wrap around, but who knows where you'll end up...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Play multiple times to get a high score. <em>Can you get past 500?</em></strong><br/></p>\r\nPro tips for getting a good score:\r\n<ol><li>Going off the edge of the screen will put you on a random edge, but it will never immediately crash your worm. You will always have at least 1 space to make a last-minute turn unless none of the edges are free.</li><li>A snake will ignore any input that asks it to turn directly into itself. Use this to your advantage to make some snakes move but not others, and un-couple their movement.</li><li>Avoid excessive turning as this will get you into trouble very quickly. Try travelling in straighter lines and using the edge warping to your advantage.</li><li>Avoid U-turns at all costs. Even if it looks safe on one screen, it's likely going to crash another worm pretty quickly.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:02:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f72e1808c6e56f3cbb460f41755424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AugsEU"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
