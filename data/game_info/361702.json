Every time you swap mechs, your stats reset to level 1! Choose between the red-starter (who packs a punch), the green-starter (who can take a hit), or the blue-starter (who is quite quick).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Fight against opponents in arena style combat. You win\u00a0by draining the opponent's battery to zero, then getting one final blow! But, be careful. Each attack you use drains <em>your </em>battery.\u00a0 Thankfully, you can recharge by getting successful hits.\u00a0</p><p>Every time you win, you gain extra power.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beat the training dummy until your stats bend the fabric of the universe!</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD &gt; Move</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0E &gt; Interact</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 L-Click &gt; Basic attack</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R-Click &gt; Launch weapon (hold to aim, release to fire)</p>\n<p>P.S.

I hope to flesh this game out in the future after I finish my current, long-term project.
