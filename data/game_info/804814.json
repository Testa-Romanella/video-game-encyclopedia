Plant trees and flowers to make the place cozy, give them their favourite food and some shelter for those cold nights and maybe the occasional belly rub to keep them happier than ever. Of course you could just sit back and relax while they go for a swim or chase the beachballs, as well as each other, around!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With 40+ species of animal to look after, and each one having their own minor needs to cater for, keeping them all happy should prove a small challenge. Some have favourite foods and areas of the map, others need a few extra belly rubs than most to truly feel loved. Others are more playful and would rather belly flop from the waterfall or pop some balloons to keep themselves amused.<br/><br/>Look after them, they need a helping hand!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T08:27:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa1/aa1d41c0851e33fbdf357db5400f7080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 321, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dysthesia Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Dysthesia Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
