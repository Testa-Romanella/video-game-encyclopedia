After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>You've received a letter from King Mersant bidding you travel urgently to the Islands of Lubdan in the far away country of Loegria. When you land you find out who really summoned you there. Be ready for adventure. You could die so keep extra save files!<br/><br/>This expansion is a first in a new series for The Quest Classic and has been designed for low level characters. It's highly recommended that you start a new character to fully enjoy it. To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select \"Celtic Rift\" as your travel destination.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Celtic Rift has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/166/16662591fe7e8d1f0cf6f5ee1b6c61c8.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
