No two games will ever be the same.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T10:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c510f2068f5a9047dbdc6c56f610efd.jpg", "website": "http://thefew.pl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 158, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BlackMoon Design"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["BlackMoon Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
