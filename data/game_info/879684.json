Contestants have a chance to win big on this show but it is also quite dangerous. In fact, the contestant loses only when they pass out! But despite the risks, Rebecca isn't about to pass up this opportunity. She's planning a honeymoon so she needs all the money she can get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rebecca has 3 hit points and it is easy to lose them if you don't pay attention to your surroundings.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>A random event is triggered once you obtain 4 battery charges. Events will be your best method for obtaining cash. Eliminating enemies is also lucrative.</p>\n<p>$2000\u00a0$3000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$3000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$4000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$5000\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any enemy or hazard with\u00a0a red outline hurts Rebecca on contact.
