As the First Wave settled, it became apparent that the aliens would invade Earth for one thing \u2026 and one thing only: Bundt Cake. You see, round cake is an affront to these boxy aliens, who scoured the Galaxy looking to eradicate any species with the knowledge to bake it. Earth is next in line.

One hit, and you\u2019re dead \u2013  though if you have skill, you\u2019ll quickly slip into \u201cthe zone\u201d and duck and weave through alien hordes without a second thought. You have three different game modes to choose from \u2013 each with their own rules: Bunker Defense, Protect Yourself, and PANIC. There\u2019s room for different playstyles: Focus on shooting, weave through enemy waves to collect upgrades \u2013 or dodge the aliens dropping from the sky.
