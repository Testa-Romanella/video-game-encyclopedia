When summoned, a random selection of 6 chessmen are chosen between the 6 classes of chessmen, Pawns, Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queens and Kings.</p>\n<p>Pawns and Rooks go after Knights and Bishops</p>\n<p>Knights and Bishops go after Queens and Kings</p>\n<p>Queens and Kings go after Pawns and Rooks</p>\n<p>All chessmen have between 1 and\u00a03 lives.</p>\n<p>All the actions taken by every chessmen are shown in the Combat Log. The Combat Log can be scrolled up or down using a mouse scroll wheel, or dragging the Combat Log up or down on click.</p>\n<p>There isn't much human interaction in this game in this game besides adding more chessmen on both sides by a multiple of 6,\u00a0but the production has definitely has built the foundation of my understanding behind the mechanics of NPC characters.</p>\n<p>My\u00a0second game is a DDLC mod, but I cannot publish it here as it is a violation of Team Salvato IP Guidelines :( I'll get it soon on my personal website which will be posted here and on my itch page :3</p>\n<p>I do not own any of the unity assets, font or the music.
