{"id": 276945, "slug": "slide-football", "name": "Slide Football", "name_original": "Slide Football", "description": "Slide Football is reminiscent of paper football.  You can play against the phone or a friend.  Against the phone, the Pro mode scores regularly and never goes out of bounds.  Score a touchdown by landing directly on the opposing line, and earn 7 points.  If you push too hard, the football will go off the board, and you get a penalty.  Also, if you delay the game by waiting longer than 10 seconds to make a move, you get a penalty.  When you get 3 penalties, your opponent is awarded 3 points.<br/><br/>Two player mode does not require sign on.  We simply use the game IDs to manage the game.  So you either start the game or join the game.  The starter gets the code and shares it with the joiner.  Play begins immediately after the joiner enters the code.  Play against friends with either iPhone or Android phones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efbf74f0abe42fb4ab842264b888a337.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Little Family Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Little Family Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
