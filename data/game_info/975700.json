Lifespan limitation, break through the lifespan limitation and pursue longevity;<br/>4. Equipment wearing, equipment affects the combat effect of cards;<br/>5. Encounter experience, specific time, specific events happen;<br/>6. Exploration experience, small exploration levels, busy time.<br/><br/>From the developers:<br/>Everyone will think that this game has copied \u300aStack Lands\u300b, admittedly, what you see may be thought that even the UI is not even lazy to modify, here we are very sorry.<br/>At the same time, we are sorry and very grateful for the inspiration brought to us by \u300aStack Lands\u300b, we think it is a very good game mode, easy but not simple, in the stacked mode, we think there is still a lot of room to play, but we ask ourselves that we can't do it for the time being, but we hope that we don't add more to the snake. So we took the immortal as the theme, and added some elements that we think can be more enriched, such as card growth, life span limitations, exploration copies, etc., and at the same time, we thought to avoid affecting the experience of the stacking mode, which is not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's an attempt.<br/>This is a game developed by only two people, in the resources and time constraints, but also faced with the problem of survival, my partner and I do not have much choice, we had thought of doing space battles, but ultimately in this version did not materialize, and the future is also unknown. In the end, no matter whether you praise or curse, thank you very much for your attention to this game, I hope you have fun, and I hope you can support \u300aStack Lands\u300b. I hope you can support Stacked Continent. I also hope that there are people who can carry forward this mode better.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-08T07:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/606/606048658744c988b764533fd5f05a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One leaf Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["One leaf Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
