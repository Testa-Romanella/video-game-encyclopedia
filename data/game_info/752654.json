The course was a great help in teaching me the basics of blueprints and creating my first game in Unreal. However, it didn't take long before I got carried away with the project and started to add a lot of extra enemies and features!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arachnophobia is an arcade top down shooter in which it is your goal to kill as many spiders as possible! With every new wave you complete this mission will get slightly more difficult... Use the power-ups that are being dropped to your advantage! Can you set a new high score?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game can be played with either mouse &amp; keyboard or a gamepad. Please note that the gamepad is currently not supported in in-game menus.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:53:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cf/3cfc11cb0e86aa18e3c728b1051d3d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Viktor van Onzenoort"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
