The player's protagonist accidentally gained the ability to reverse time because he was infected with a meteorite virus. With the blessing of this special force, the protagonist will re dominate the world in the cycle of life and death.<h3>Game Features</h3>Backdate Hero is a challenging 2d rouge lite action game. Like traditional rouge lite games, the game map will be randomly generated at the beginning of each game, and you will decide on your own way to promote the game. You can choose to face a strong enemy or switch a route. Meanwhile, the game focuses on the combination of weapons and props, and provides a large number of usable weapons and props. You can match them freely and choose your own unique fighting style. The combination of different props and buffs can usually produce different outstanding performance. Eventually, you will collect more props and become more powerful in the process of constantly exploring the map.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T04:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/257945ab280e5a74c7c257384d78a322.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 481, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flute Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flute Games", "HyperStar"], "esrb_rating": null}
