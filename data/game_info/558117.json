Of course,\u00a0 people are not going to just give you their hands. Luckily you have a power to see their deepest materialistic desires, and all the goods are just lying around on the ground. Just bring an item to a stranger and grab their hand! Sounds easy enough, right?</p>\n<p>Well, you should also watch out for paladins, their light will revail your true form\u00a0(which is quite useless since it doesn't have hands). And your lovely strangers are always in move, so you need to be close to them. Oh, did I mention you only have two minutes of time to grab all of hands on level? Don't worry, you can always escape!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>semi-random maps</li><li>theoretically infinite number of levels (probably crashes at some point)</li><li>lots of hands to grab</li><li>lots of gifts to give</li><li>villagers that never sleep and always have somewhere to go</li></ul>\n<p>Graphics and sounds are free assets.
