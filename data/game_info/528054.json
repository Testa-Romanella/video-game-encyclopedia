Some aspects will be permanent, others are yet to be implemented (like the placeholder for the main character).</p>\n<p>At the moment only one boss, Li Yan, is present in the game: she only has 2 animations, but she should be fully functional. As for the traps, they have no animations but all 6 of them should work properly (they are only a small percentage of the overall number of traps we will have). Important note: as design, only 5 traps can be placed in the arena at the same time. To read their description, just hover over them. Note that\u00a0 we got resolution's problem with commands legend (we apologies if you don't see the command's image).</p>\n<p>The controls for the arena building are present in game, the controls for the player movement are not. Just read the following list before playing to know how to do so:</p>\n<p>-[Space] Tap to dash and backstep, Hold to run<br/></p>\n<p>-[WASD] to move</p>\n<p>-[Left Mouse] to attack</p>\n<p>-[Right Click] to perform an heavy attack<br/></p>\n<p>-[Press Shift + Left Mouse] to use a projectile</p><p><strong>PLEASE SEND US A FEEDBACK BY FILL THIS SURVEY</strong><br/></p><p>Hypodoche feedback survey<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/019b03a0d53ae0e2b47025a85e556710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
