{"id": 118371, "slug": "no-rules-chess", "name": "No Rules Chess", "name_original": "No Rules Chess", "description": "<p>\"No Rules Chess\"\u00a0was born out of a simple question:</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IF CHESS HAD NO RULES?</strong></p>\n<p>One upstart game developer was brave enough to ask the question, and yet braver enough to answer it. This is the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<p><em>Can two pieces occupy the same space?<br/></em>Why not.</p>\n<p><em>How do I take a piece?<br/></em>There's no rule for that, that's not a thing.</p>\n<p><em>Is there a win condition?<br/></em>No, because that would require a rule. It's like you're not listening.</p><p><em>I want to win! How can I win?<br/></em>So I guess you're not listening. Fine. If you want to win, you can win. There are no rules that says you can't win, so you win, I guess. Congratulations!</p>\n<p><em>Why would anyone make this?</em><br/>When I started programming as a kid,\u00a0I messed around with graphics and made stuff that bounced around and flashed different colours. Then programming became my job, and it also became very boring.\u00a0 Not just boring, but\u00a0\"systems integrations\" boring. I haven't coded anything just for fun for years and years. When Sophie announced #ChessJam, I made a dumb quip about \"chess with no rules\", and later I realized that I could follow through on the joke and\u00a0actually just make it. And wouldn't you know it, coding can be fun.</p>\n<p><em>Why does my browser say that you're trying to load unsafe scripts?<br/></em>Because sometimes itch.io tries to load stuff from HTTP when it should be using HTTPS. I don't know why. Refreshing the page seems to fix it?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d1c58c9867e2cf2df4092f223f4916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iaoth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
