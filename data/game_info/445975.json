At first it was going to be a human but then decided it would be a ghost that lacks the ability to go though the walls so the reasoning for that? Well if you said the house was cursed well then ill tell you what! It is. the whole thing was meant to be a sort of game about gaining freedom to the outside world after being stuck in the inside though the engine i made the game in (and more so my lack of knowledge in making games with it) creatively limited me and so i just ended up making a short little speed game (or something) to be fair i'm not quite sure what i made myself. But one day in the near future maybe ill come back to this and make what i originally intended!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the\u00a0PB &amp; Game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/892c69dac4c244ffe937317185320d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plambt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
