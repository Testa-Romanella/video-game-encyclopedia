It has quite some bugs but I applied what I've learned as for optimization! In my opinion, it's fairly OK optimized however it's very messy coding and if you would like to have a real \"my-first-game\" experience, give this a go and let me know how it went!</p>\n<p>Looking back at this project it sucks. However I would like to display my first-ever game so I'm putting it here.</p>\n<p>Story of the game: You are a goblin working for a company that scavenges materials/fossils from islands. You start on your personal Zeppelin, and then can select missions.\u00a0The islands you are sent to are voxel-based, 100% destructible. You must complete your objective and then get out of the island. According to what you have mined/scavenged, you will be able to spend the currencies (which I did not implement yet). Heavily inspired by\u00a0Coffee Stain Studio's Deep Rock Galactic.</p>\n<p>This is like the first ever build of the game and as I mentioned, it's messy code so if you encounter any bugs/errors/issues let me know!</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Rare Island Fox causes fps drops if cornered somewhere.</li><li>Creatures have very basic AI/attacking logic so sometimes they won't attack if overlapping with each other.</li><li>Weapons have miscalculations if your ammo drops below the mag-size capacity.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe8efbae60b63b0e0302d98c5e7556b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ISIK Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
