You have to kill everyone on sight. Beware that D34TH has limited power, so you have to charge him up before the power runs out.</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Z to shoot and select</li><li>X to jump</li></ul>\r\nEdit\r\n<p>I\u00a0have fixed a bug where the camera would move when you are in a boss fight. So the file \"Old_D34TH\" is the old game and \"D34TH\" is the new one. If you come from Ludum Dare, here is the new source code:\u00a0\u00a0falkbruskeland.com/ludumdare/d34th_source.rar</p>\n<p>I have also added a new file for the QWERTZ keyboard users, where you use Y to shoot and X to jump. I asked Mike if that was okay, and he said it was!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/633a936fa1ea4e5ffd7c17601561cb06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falkisen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
