In about a month, it's her birthday! Therefore, since I am the best supportive brother, I developed a game out of her characters from her roleplay/art Instagram account, __.hybrids.__ It's a pretty nifty account. I 9/10 recommend it.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, now talking about the game, it first starts with a visual novel. However, once you get past that(or just hit the \"go straight to game\" option at the start menu), you will be greeted with a colorful bullet-hell game. Well, it's not that bullet-hell. You could probably destroy those watermelons easily. This is a decent competitive game for family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Update: added more of my sister's drawings, nerfed the firing rate of the enemies and shooter, changed dialogue, and added start menu button on the rules scene.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57e29106f5e332a2d5d6c396a88325dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JushGray"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
