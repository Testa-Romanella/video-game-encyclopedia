Can you rush to get that high-score?!</p>\n<p>This game is based on the original Tunnel Rush. My version of tunnel rush is very basic compared to this version, I would consider it a draft or concept game. There is so much more that can be done gameplay wise!</p>\n<p><strong>Created by: /&lt;DDev (Aka\u00a0Breaking_Reality)<br/></strong><strong>Youtube:\u00a0/&lt;DDev - YouTube</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music Credit:<br/>Track: StarZ<br/>Music by TheRedSkull</li><li>Track: Electric Fields<br/>Music by https://www.fiftysounds.com</li><li>Track: Neon+on<br/>Music by\u00a0DSTechnician / Pixabay</li><li>Track: Robot Laser Carnage<br/>Music by\u00a0DSTechnician / Pixabay</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T13:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbd222ed9b1eb46966edecb7f161cdd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Breaking_Reality"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
