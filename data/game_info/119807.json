Your goal as the player is to tell the difference between your own files and the files the virus adds and sort them into their correct locations, either the \"My Stuff\" folder or the \"Trash\" folder. If your computer runs out of space you lose, and the virus only increases the rate at which it adds files as time goes on, so move quick!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a881311733d04186097390e941fc0716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KivuliVapo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
