You control a small bunny that carries his trusty carrot gun (which unfortunately doesn't fire any carrot, couldn't implement it). You can somewhat aim it.</p>\n<p>While there is a sort of moon jump when jumping along edges, the physics turned out pretty nicely and would need minor changes and fixes for a full-fledged game.</p>\n<p>I'm also very happy with how the character and his animations turned out as I feel it captures the aesthetic of Rare platformer games from the 64 era perfectly. This is particularly enhanced by the fact I actually made a faux-3-point filtering (the filtering system the N64 used) vertex-lit shader like many of these games used (albeit often a more archaic lighting system I believe).\u00a0Have fun with my little experiment, I sure had creating it!</p>\n<p>I hope to revisit it in the coming weeks, but I won't make any promise since I always thought I would come back to my Jam projects and never did yet. But things can change !</p>\n<p>Oh there's also some occlusion culling bug going on with ProBuilder meshes. As far as I know this is not my fault. It can probably be fixed with tweaking but should work right out of the box, I will have to be careful if I ever decide to use it more fully.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db0a5ea367015b35db7a97d601e5f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DevilBlackDeath"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
