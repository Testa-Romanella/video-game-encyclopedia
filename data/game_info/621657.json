(The player name and the starter Pokete will be chosen using a wizard later). The controls are w a s d to walk around.\r\n</p>\n<p>When entering the high grass (;), you may be attacked by a wild Pokete. By pressing 1 you can choose between the attacks (as long their AP is over 0) your Pokete got, by pressing the according number, or navigating the \"*\"-cursor to the attack and pressing enter. The wild Pokete will fight back, you can kill it and gain XP to level up your Pokete or you can catch it to let it fight for you. To catch a Pokete you have to first weaken the enemy and then throw a Poketeball. And with a bit luck you can catch it. Pressing the \"1\" key you can take a look at your current deck, see the detailed information of your Pokete and your attacks or rearrange them. Changes will only be saved by quitting the game using the exit function.\r\n</p>\n<p>Since your a Pokete-Trainer, you can also fight against other trainers, the one other \"a\", that's staying in the middle of the landscape will start a fight with you, when you go into his way. You can not escape from such a trainer fight, you either have to win, or lose. Those trainer fights give double the XP.\r\n</p>\n<p>In case one of your Poketes dies, or is too weak, you can heal it by going into the house, aka, Pokete-Center, talk the the person there and choose the healing option. There you can also take a look at all your Poketes, and not just the first six. The ones marked with an \"o\" are the ones in your deck.\r\n</p>\n<p>By pressing \"e\" you can get into a menu where player name and later other settings, can be changed.\r\n</p>\n<p>The red balls all over the map, are Poketeballs, you need to catch Poketes. Stepping on such a ball adds it to your inventory.\r\n</p>\n<p>See\u00a0How to play.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game depth</p>\n<p>Not only are there Poketes that are stronger than others, but also Poketes with different types, which are effective against some types and ineffective against others.\r\n</p>\r\nTypeEffective againstIneffective againstNormal\r\n\r\n\r\nStone\r\nFlying, Fire\r\nPlant\r\nPlant\r\nStone, Ground, Water\r\nFire\r\nWater\r\nStone, Flying, Fire\r\nPlant\r\nFire\r\nFlying, Plant, Undead\r\nStone, Water\r\nGround\r\nNormal\r\nFlying\r\nElectro\r\nStone, Flying\r\nGround\r\nFlying\r\nPlant\r\nStone\r\nUndead\r\nNormal, Ground, Plant, Water\r\nFire\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information you can see\u00a0wiki.\r\n</p>\n<p>Tips</p>\n<ul><li>In conversations you can very easily skip the text printing by pressing any key\r\n</li><li>When you want to see the next text in a conversation, also just press any key\r\n</li><li>Don't play on full-screen, the game then starts to be overseeable\r\n</li><li>Don't be offended by the other trainers, they may swear at you\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>TODO</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Add a wizard to set name and choose starter Pokete at the start\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Add More maps\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Add types for attacks and Poketes\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Add evolving\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Add more than one Pokete for trainers\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Coloured Poketes\r\n</li><li>\u00a0A store to buy Poketeballs\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Add potions\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Dependencies</p>\n<p>Pokete depends on python3 and the scrap_engine module.
