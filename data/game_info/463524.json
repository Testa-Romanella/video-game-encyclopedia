After defenses are put down, use them in real-time during the action phase and either decimate the whole army or slow them down enough to beat the clock. This is a spin on the classic tower defense genre where you take active control of towers with more high-pace and reaction based game play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10d61be4145a7314ecb9d6d4342a78e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vhanprower"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
