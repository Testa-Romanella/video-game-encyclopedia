Every interaction with the game is with your mouse. The settings I have not setup yet, so it does nothing.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to turn the oven on.<br/></p>\r\nTutorial/Tips (Spoilers For Mechanics):\r\n<p>-Hold down to pour ingredients the longer you hold the faster it pours and if you let go it is trickling extra ingredients, which can save you time if you hold it down long enough.<br/></p>\n<p>-If you every see Coot's paw you can hover your mouse over it to push the pay back. If you are actively pouring ingredients you can't push coots back.<br/></p>\n<p>-If you see Coots's shadow going by go to the bottom of the screen and over the text and arrow. This will prevent Shadow Coot's from messing with your progress.<br/></p>\n<p>-There is a button at the top right that takes you to the oven. It takes a while to preheat and you can't cook the cookies without the oven being ready.<br/></p>\n<p>-Coots can turn the oven off listen for a metallic sound and that should tell you Coots has turned the oven off.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n-At the end, there is a section where you need to click fast to prevent Coots from turning off the oven.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T10:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdd/cdd015ec198141230e067378586b9a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yui_Furukawa"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
