{"id": 98676, "slug": "le-me", "name": "Le Me", "name_original": "Le Me", "description": "<p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tLe Me is a 2 dimensional mysterious puzzle game, the main task is for you to get out from various building. You will be given a limited food, then you have to find some tools to help you out, and of course you are ALONE. The main idea is from escape room but Le Me has a bigger scale than that.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game will be release in some stages for the first phase and we will add more stages in the future.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can save your progress in one building since maybe you will need a very long time to finish one building. But if you try to play in another building while having some progress from other building that haven't finished yet, you will have to overwrite that slot (You only have one slot of save).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFeatures (Maybe we can add more features in the future) :\r\n</p><ol>\n<li>Save game</li>\n<li>Compatible with XBOX Controller</li>\n<li>Various puzzle &amp; some of riddle questions</li>\n<li>Many building that you can explore</li>\n<li>High playtime in one stage (except you are far too smart :p )</li>\n<li>Blind mode (In Progress).
