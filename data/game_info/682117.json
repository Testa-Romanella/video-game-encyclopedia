A small town that was the unwitting participant in a botched government experiment.</p>\n<p>Over a period of weeks, the towns people were secretly exposed to an airborne chemical that is designed to make the person \"less Intelligent\"\u00a0 with the hope that the \"infected\" people,\u00a0 will be less likely to question authority. and follow directions without question.</p>\n<p>Well, it worked, a little too good. Now we have a town overrun with mindless zombies!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a few folks that appear to be immune to the chemical and now they are left cowering in fear for their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is your job to go in and rescue as many of them as possible and to kill as many zombies as you like!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, one of the scientists that was secretly working\u00a0in the city fled so fast he left behind a bunch of important briefcases full of secret information! If you could collect them as well, we'd be very pleased!</p>\n<p>By the way, did I mention you are on a time limit??
