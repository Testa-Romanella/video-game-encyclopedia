The tooltip shows damage, cooldown, action point cost, effects and a description.<br/>\r\nWe have added target highlights that displays valid targets as you hover over abilities. This makes it a bit easier to figure out how and where you can apply your abilities.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Movement highlighting has been reworked with a new look. It should now be easier to see how far you can move and how many action points you spend.</li></ul>\r\nREWARD SCENE\r\n<ul><li>This week's level features a wider variety of enemy types. No more fighting only Pigmen. You will encounter zombie-like beings called Flayed Ones, demon soldiers, demon mages, and two types of wasps.<br/>We are testing how a wider variety of enemies impacts the combat gameplay.</li></ul>\r\nREWARD SCENE\r\n<ul><li>The reward scene has been implemented. It still needs a lot of work, but now you can grant your heroes new abilities.<br/>New abilities and status effects</li></ul>\r\nNEW ABILITIES AND STATUS EFFECTS\r\n<ul><li>We have implemented a wide range of status effects that can have a huge impact on the gameplay:</li></ul>\n<ul><li>We added visual effects to all of the status effects, so it should be easier to see when characters are affected</li></ul>\n<ul><li>We have added a range of new abilities that utilize the recently implemented status effects. Some abilities now uses a knock-back effect which will knock enemies away from you.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>We also added effects to all abilities when held in the hand.
