HU provided programmers, and Moore provided artists, and we combined together to create two games (one per team). This was our \"completed\" game, I made the menus and some other fun stuff, and got to experiment quite a bit. While it isn't a full, or even really playable, game, I had a lot of fun making it and working with my coding partner and our two artists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef4c616e75101f5a7fc9debf56f28a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CabooseNomerson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
