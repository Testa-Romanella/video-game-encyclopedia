You've tried all those YouTube video workouts, but you're getting sick of redoing the same workout over and over again - you need something <strong>new</strong>. You've seen all the commercials for Peloton and the Lululemon workout mirror, but that's not in the budget right now - you need something <strong>affordable</strong>. Your roommate is just as busy as you are so you don't have someone to keep you accountable - you need something <strong>interactive</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, you're in luck because we created <strong>Pulse</strong>!

You strap on your <strong>Pulse</strong> bracelet and click start.</p>\n<p>The upbeat music starts playing, and you recognize the song. You're ready to break a sweat. You watch from your laptop as the <strong>workout starts</strong>. 3, 2, 1, GO!\u00a0Squats! Lunges! More squats! As you're following the movements of the trainer in the video, you see the number in the top left corner of the screen increase. Your heart rate is going up! You're squat pulsing it out, and all of a sudden the <strong>particles</strong>/<strong>shapes</strong> flying around in the background <strong>change</strong> from red to green. You know you've just reached\u00a0the <strong>Fat Burning Zone</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>After 10 minutes of lower body burn, your first video of the 2-part combo is complete. You're pumped and move right into the next workout video. Once again, you change those particles from red to green, but this time much quicker! There are occasional <strong>animations</strong>\u00a0that pop up on the sides of the screen that tell you to\u00a0keep it up!</p>\n<p>You <strong>feel good </strong>and you had a <strong>fun</strong> <strong>time</strong> following the energetic trainer, listening to great music, getting live feedback on your work, and watching the cool graphics move around the screen. </p>\n<p>Exercise is about more than losing weight or gaining muscle. It's about doing good things for your body, but as college students ourselves, we know that our priorities often lie elsewhere. We don't always have the time and energy to drive to the gym or have more than a couple of minutes to search YouTube for the perfect video. We want <strong>Pulse</strong> users to have the freedom to personalize their workouts as well as give them a fun experience!</p>\n<ul><li>Short videos (4-12 minutes) to allow for personalized workouts\r\n</li><li>Live visual\u00a0feedback</li><li>Wide variety of workouts videos</li><li>Wearable that constantly tracks your BPM</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54fdef02acefaddc39b19a04a117601f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["maxtruty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
