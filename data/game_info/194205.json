The setting is sort of like a reconstruction of what I remember, although the walls of the brook are much higher so that the camera doesn't smash through the bridges that cross overhead. The player is a frog tadpole humanoid creature because i wanted a nonhuman character that still feels like a person in some way.</p>\n<p>I liked making something small that didn't have too many things about. I think the way the tadpole character falls over is funny, and coding that was fun too. Figuring out how I wanted to have the game look was tough, because I've never done 3D visual design of this type before.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b9928ddf3014797107b4a726763ad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["4m4nd4"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
