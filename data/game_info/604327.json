In this realm from an unknown dimension, the inhabitants are sentient severed human body parts. No one knows its origin. Some believe it has existed since the beginning of time: Rumour has it that the land itself is the God of Creation's very own sandbox environment for prototyping human beings. These body parts have an eternal lifespan and their existence is extremely painful and lonely. Cupid has taken pity on these body parts and therefore decided to use his \u201cbow of attraction\u201d to connect them with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>For the best experience, download the desktop build. The web build above has a number of issues, such as increased limb spawn rate,\u00a0due to the usage of system generated random numbers.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use your bow to attach limbs to the Cuties and match Cuties together!
