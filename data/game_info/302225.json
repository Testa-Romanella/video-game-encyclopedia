{"id": 302225, "slug": "peryton", "name": "Peryton", "name_original": "Peryton", "description": "<p>PERYTON is a roguelike played in the cross-section of a twisted dungeon. You play as a Peryton, the mighty winged stag of myth. Unfortunately, a recent battle has damaged your wings and you can no longer fly.<br/></p>\n<p>Taking refuge in a sprawling cavern network, you find that you have the power to rotate the dungeon itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>** PERYTON is based on cutting-edge web browser features. It works perfectly with the latest version of Chrome.\u00a0No guarantees about performance or compatibility with other browsers! **<br/><br/><br/>## Instructions</p>\n<p>Press Right/L to rotate the map clockwise 90 degrees, and Left/H to rotate the map counterclockwise by 90 degrees. Rotating the dungeon affects the direction of gravity, which will always pull you toward the bottom of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While you can't fly, you can glide or dive as necessary.</p>\n<p>Press Up/K to glide downward one tile. You will also sweep your mighty antlers below you, knocking enemies back and stunning them for one turn.<br/></p>\n<p>Press Down/J to dive straight toward whatever is below you. This is the ONLY WAY TO DAMAGE ENEMIES, and causes increased damage and knockback the farther you fall.</p>\n<p>Mouse over an enemy tile to get information about that enemy.</p>\n<p>Press Up/K while standing on a\u00a0<em>blue portal tile</em> to move to the next dungeon level.</p>\n<p>## Goal</p>\n<p>Peryton features no character progression. Your only goal is to survive the 10 chambers of the caverns. Do not delay. Every turn spent in the caverns increases the chance that a pursuer, selected from a menagerie of terrifying monsters, will appear.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>## Design Statement</p>\n<p>I was playing a lot of DCSS and while that game has fantastic dungeon generation, the physical geogaphy of the levels don't matter much to the player's experience. What would it be like to play a roguelike where the map's shape was central to how the game plays? I hit upon the idea that the player can only move along one axis (and changing the axis of movement changes the shape of the level), and PERYTON was born.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T04:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca4c10e31850d41899008da03bfa65c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rgscherf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
