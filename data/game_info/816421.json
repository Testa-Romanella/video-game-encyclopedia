Build the hole as you play, alternating between putting the ball and placing hazards on the course, trying to score the most points while messing with your friends! <br/><br/>Finishing the hole within the time limit will award you with points. Bonus points are awarded for finishing first, fewest strokes or hitting a hole-in-one!<br/><br/>Choose a golfer, then your ball, and start putting! Each round, players choose from a random selection of obstacles to modify the hole. Place down bumpers, windmills, cannons, and blocks to create a new and challenging hole. First player to reach the target score will win!<h3>Build the hole as you play</h3><br/><br/>Grab a few friends for some couch co-op competitiveness as you compete to be the best golfer.<br/>Use Steam Remote Play Together to invite your friends online to a match.<br/><br/>Supports up to four players, using either controllers or keyboard configurations (or both!)
