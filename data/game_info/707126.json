Please note that while this build SHOULD be finishable, it is simply impossible for me to test out every combination of options at this point. It is also a little less polished than Episode 1, so while all the story paths etc are in and SHOULD be working,\u00a0 I am releasing it as is and may go back to it to tweak and expand in due time. The only area I would be particularly cautious of is the science lab near the end - it exists, but isn't tested well, and while it theoretically works (and you should at least be able to exit), various factors make it a little... fragile. Avoid entering it or wait for the .gb ROM (so you can save before just in case) would be my advice for now. There are also small graphical things I would intend to fix, and if you find any major issues (conversations that just stop and progress becomes impossible, for example), please do let me know and I will update to fix them as best as I can. It is entirely possible some late change has broken something without me realising, but hopefully not...<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for your time! :)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: .gb ROM for emulators or actual hardware. <br/></p>\n<p>https://mega.nz/file/KExAwITB#uvVlAYM7zrj0AXPLO1IF3hBnbMLhW4a5zJU7lmU_eqk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T19:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f824e995a94cdf774bfbba32966df0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lifeis2d"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
