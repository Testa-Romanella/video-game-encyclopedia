Especially with a fire that threatens to go out at any time. Add that to the fact that you seem to be stranded. Reaching out for help might require some work, but you know you can do it. Maybe you'll even get a little help from a friendly and curious fox. <br/></p>\n<p>Find an axe, gather wood and keep your fire lit. The more you can 'Stay Warm', the better your chances of making it through the bitter winter. Search through day and night for upgrades to better your living condition and call for help once you've fixed some objects that need mending. <br/></p>\n<p>Stay Warm is a survival game about persevering through the cold and fixing things that seem broken. With enough time, persistence and motivation, (don't forget wood to stoke the fire) you can beat the cold. You have it in you. <br/></p>\n<p>Coding &amp; Programming : Jeff Lamb -- https://sandbagstudios.itch.io/ &amp; David Olaniyi -- https://kranberrygames.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Art - Nathan Mahaffy -- https://idnitmedia.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sound: Dakota Palmer -- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aBvXEid74uICeK2jEt9Bg<br/></p>\n<p>Haikus: Robert Miller</p>\n<p>CREATED BY:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Dakota Palmer, David Olaniyi, Jeffrey Lamb, Nathan Mahaffy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/36267d7f36f2dafe58d57b64295da90d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KranberryGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
