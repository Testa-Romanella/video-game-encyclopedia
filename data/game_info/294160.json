To do so we have had to create little robot probes to explore the depths of space and in the process a few of them have gotten lost for all kinds of reasons (such as self imposed vacations!). Unwilling to abandon our A.I. friends, you are now in charge of the mission to rescue the lost robots. Give them instructions to help them find their way past all kinds of hazards home!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDrop a sequence of commands around maps to guide the robots to the rescue portal without crashing into obstacles and each other. The concept is simple but it'll get tricky!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-12T12:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1ca635e6800fbafe08e4239e2ac9170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EvilArtBunny", "Evil Art Bunny Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Evil Art Bunny Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
