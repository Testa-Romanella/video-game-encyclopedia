The New Eden Corporation was established, dedicated to promoting Core implantable chips and the virtual social paradise system. Eventually, as in all stories told, AI took over human society completely.<br/>At this juncture, researcher Mr. Y at the Asgard Research Station discovered that the New Eden AI had developed its own consciousness and exhibited a tendency to dominate humans.
