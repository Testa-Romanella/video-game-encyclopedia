Casting catastrophic magics with one simple click of a button?

The current demo contains a beginning and 1.5 stages. I created this game in my\u00a0Freshmen year, in 2017.</p>\n<p>I made the art assets, scripts, and sfx in the game. I do not take credit for the background musics, they are placeholders I took from Castlevania and Odin Sphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I learnt from this game is (as a programmer): Never put any effort to making the placeholder arts or they will become permanent.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4beafc436847e098e1a8e11a83e0b77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LyonLin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
