{"id": 337251, "slug": "tricky-fox-itch", "name": "Tricky Fox (itch)", "name_original": "Tricky Fox (itch)", "description": "<p>A funny platform/puzzle game in which you have to make all tiles disappear on the level by walking or jumping on them. Beware \u2013 once a tile disappears, it\u2019s very easy to fall into the bottomless pit and hurt yourself. When all tiles are done, the exit portal will open \u2013 just jump into it to get to the next level.<br/><br/>Help this little fox clear the levels off tiles by jumping on them. Some tiles need to be jumped on in a specific order. There are tiles with spikes coming out of them when you clear another tile so move only when the spike is not out. In later levels, you will see moving tiles too.<br/><br/>Tricky Fox is the sequel to Tricky Cat with all new gameplay, graphics, music, sounds, and much more levels. Are you able to challenge yourself again?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4afed83ca96f7d0bc910aa1584fa449d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nannings"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
