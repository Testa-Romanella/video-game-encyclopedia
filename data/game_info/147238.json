You play as a man. I think he\u2019s named Bob. It\u2019s open for interpretation. Don\u2019t worry. You wake up in your room. You can explore your room. Your world is bland and unmoving. But if you explore, you\u2019ll soon discover you can log into your computer, and play WORLD OF MMOCRAFT. You can go on quests. You can grind. You can get frustrated in PVP. You look for a group to run a dungeon, but you might have to re-queue since nobody needs DPS and you should feel bad. You try to get to endgame. Why? Because that\u2019s what you do \u2013 shuddup don\u2019t question the MMO format. It\u2019s abstract and weird.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc68bf38d60fce1cba53d07d3cf1f3cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["jdavidson091"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
