Read dad jokes on signs!\u00a0Listen to 8 bit nursery rhymes!</p>\n<p>Red is a working prototype of a non-violent, quest driven RPG-like for kids (big and small). It's intended to give an introduction to RPG's which is simple to play - e.g. using big sprites (at 64x64 res anyway) so characters are identifiable, using a grid movement to avoid getting 'stuck', flip style screens to help navigation. Hopefully it will also aim at developing memory, simple problem solving,\u00a0map navigation and digital skills.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how successfully it achieves the above, but seems like a good starting point! There's an awful more I wanted to add and will aim to in a later update - mini-games, additional quests, hidden areas, achievements etc.</p>\n<p>Red is based on the Perrault version of the tale which is a little less known that the Grimm version. Average play time of the whole thing is about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>All assets, music and coding by me, except the tree sprite which was taken from\u00a0Blowhard 2: Blow Harder by Surt (https://opengameart.org/content/blowhard-2-blow-harder). Palette stolen from Pico-8 (https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Font by Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts). Character sprites are heavily inspired by early Pokemon sprites. Music is a medley of nursery rhymes (a-tisket a-tasket, mary mary quite contrary, mary had a little lamb and\u00a0goosey goosey gander) played on a Pocket Operator Robot (https://teenage.engineering/products/po). I used Phaser 3 (https://phaser.io/) as a game engine, NippleJS (https://yoannmoi.net/nipplejs/) for the touch screen controls and created the sprites in doteditor on iOS.</p>\n<p>Oh, by the way, I still haven't worked out how to make crisp games on Microsoft browsers - best on anything other than Edge or IE...</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/13011ae5b688e88b8bdc9a01b082768f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dancramp"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
