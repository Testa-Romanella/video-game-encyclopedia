The purpose of this build is to gather some early feedback to work and improve the level generation and the turn based combat.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it and please leave any feedback on the comments section below!</p><p>PS: music and sound effects does not belong to me, they belong to the game Bloodborne.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a40b9b2bb9e7110dff1f989b4c11a48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fourth Dimension"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
