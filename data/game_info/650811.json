He said we should give her a \"Baton\".<br/><br/>The grandfather of the artist \"Black\" said that the images of music that \"Mi U\" expresses <br/>It is said that you should give a \"brush\" as a gift in admiration of what \"Mi U\" thinks it is shaped.<br/><br/>\"White\" opinion of wanting \"Mi U\" to be an idol to everyone around the world with music world.<br/> The opinions of \"The Darkness,\" which is curious about the future of the various paintings that \"Mi U\" represents, rather than music, collide.<br/><br/> \"Mi U\" will receive gifts from two grandfathers on Christmas Day, December 25th birthday.<br/> In the process, \"Mi U\" makes a choice, and the grandfather who is not chosen is hurt and plays tricks on \"Mi U\".<br/> \"Mi U\" hears that precious instruments have disappeared, so he goes looking for them!<h3> Imitation </h3><br/> While producing the game, I thought a lot about what to put in this game.<br/> It's cute and lovely to see \"Mi U\" play a lot of instruments in the name of rhythm games. <br/> \"Mi U\" fused with a character to make each \"expression\" created by \"Dot\" feel even more cute and lovely.<br/> How on earth can any \"character\" and \"Mi U\" blend together to make the character feel better?<br/>At the same time, can you feel the cuteness of the main character, \"Mi U\"? I lost track of time because I was worried about it a lot.<br/><br/>There are many ideas to show another cute side of Mi-woo even after making the game.<br/> Please look forward to it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e993b6a1f9e7db376f16e7533a7caa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sin Myoung Gyun"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sin Myoung Gyun"], "esrb_rating": null}
