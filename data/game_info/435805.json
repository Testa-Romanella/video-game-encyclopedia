It's less of an ACTUAL game and more of a weird text adventure that documents my progress in the course. Still, I'm very proud of the work I've done on this! Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>-Ash &lt;3</p>\n<p>(And thanks to Luke, Jo, Phil, Lee, Kara, Meadow, Scott, Remi, and my girlfriend Molly for the support and for editing the many, many typos!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1d4f84d12772173399b626c18271027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fake gamer girl comics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
