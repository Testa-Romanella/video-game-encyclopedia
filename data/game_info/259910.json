The game is very dynamic, as you will lean in, dodge and quickly prepare meals, but never experience the sickness - as there is no moving faster than your own body does! <br/>Amazing Physics - Smooth Gameplay<br/><br/>Flip the burgers, chop veggies, watch the juices slosh in an amazing display of real life physics. Not to worry, however, with smart snapping tech your prepared meals will set just nicely on the plates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Starting kitchen represents American diner with buns and burgers, crispy bacon and cheese, onions and cucumbers, fries and two flavors of juice. But we don\u2019t want you to flip burgers all your life, so there are completely different kitchens with brand new recipes incoming. <br/><br/>The best part is - you will get to have a say in what new flavors to experience and what meals to prepare!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once you see how fun is it to see buns and plates flying around, you\u2019ll be compelled to toss things at our waiter, or even at opposing chef.<br/><br/>That\u2019s fine, we all know that tossing things randomly is one of the perks of VR, so have fun and who knows, maybe you unlock a secret achievement or discover one of our easter-egg moments!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Join us at our Discord for regular updates and direct feedback<br/>Enjoy swapping stories (and recipes!) with other eager chefs.
