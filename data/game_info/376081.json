The principal idea I wanted to explore was typing spell names to evoke the casting of spells as seen in various fantasy media. Players have to open up their spellbook, type the spell names, and then cast them to defeat opponents.\u00a0The initial game was supposed to be multiplayer PvP, but I ran out of time.\u00a0 I hope to revisit the idea in the future.<br/></p>\n\n<p>KNOWN BUGS / ISSUES</p>\n<p>The game has some serious performance issues, especially when in fullscreen. Fullscreen should be avoided!</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you'll find yourself unable to jump.\u00a0When that happens, just push up against a nearby wall and you'll get your jump back.</p>\n<p>I'm really bad at art and was only able to complete the spell art before the deadline, so everything else is just a colored box.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T07:51:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdce6e43b973423bf54a139f74781614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ViolinLloyd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
