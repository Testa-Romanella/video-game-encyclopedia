And if you're still like me, you're also too embarrassed to ask. But you know for certain you've got it on your machine. Somewhere.</p>\n<p>A completed experience would involve randomly selecting different family members, simulating the feeling of shuffling through old files desperately trying to make sure you didn't miss that date. But this was made for the Low Effort Jam 14, and spending more than a night on this would be too much effort. So all you can do is open and close one window. But the cartilage is there for having more icons, windows, and overall interactivity. Which probably won't happen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62b/62b975e2cded47cf6ee9f6eb58ab0476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleFieryOne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
