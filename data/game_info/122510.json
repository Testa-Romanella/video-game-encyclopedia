{"id": 122510, "slug": "the-pit-itch", "name": "The Pit (itch)", "name_original": "The Pit (itch)", "description": "<p>The Pit is set in a world where a zero tolerance justice system sentences all criminals to be thrown down an ancient, dark abyss named The Pit. You are Beatrice and your journey is one through a treacherous and vast space of dangerous tunnels and narrow passages. Beatrice must find her husband, whom was caught practicing sorcery and was, as punishment, sent down The Pit. </p><p>In a 2.5D side scrolling (in this case down scrolling) perspective the game takes the player down a maze-like environment. The games core mechanic is centered on a \"fall and hover technique\" where the player falls down The Pit and by using a hover mechanic he or she can control the speed at which the character is falling, making it easier for the player to evade danger, collect resources or steer the character through complex and dangerous environments. <br/><br/>MAKING OF DOCUMENTARY:<br/><br/><br/>Team: <br/></p><p>3D graphics - <br/> Robin Koitzsch, Project inventor<br/> Rick Irvine<br/> Magnus Johansson<br/> <br/> 2D graphics - <br/> Victoria Teodorsson, Project Manager <br/> Anna Bengtsson<br/> <br/> Animation - <br/> Lena Envall, Art Director<br/> <br/> Audio - <br/> Adrian van den Bro\u00ebck - Audio/Music Lead<br/> <br/> Music - <br/> Victor Engstr\u00f6m<br/> Maria Olsson<br/> Hannes Rehnstr\u00f6m<br/> <br/> Programming -<br/> Jenny S\u00f6derberg - Programming Lead<br/> Rasmus Will\u00e9n<br/> Johan Lautakoski<br/> <br/> Design - <br/> Kasper Hellgren<br/> <br/> Game Writers - <br/> Adam Svensson \u00d6stlund<br/> Lisabeth R\u00e4is\u00e4nen<br/> Emilia Andersson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914ae400f2dc441945a4408654546341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
