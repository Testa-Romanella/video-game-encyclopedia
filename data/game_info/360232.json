{"id": 360232, "slug": "only-one-slime-princess", "name": "Only One Slime Princess", "name_original": "Only One Slime Princess", "description": "<p>You play as the slime in the center of the screen, destined to become the Slime Princess of the entire world! <br/>Peasant slimes come from all over to decrease your royal sliminess. Use your royal slime to turn them into royal jelly so you can absorb them to grow larger! When you absorb too many peasant slimes, your royal jelly becomes tainted and you yourself become a peasant slime.</p>\n<p>For every peasant slime absorbed you gain 1 blob. Blobs are used for currency and ammo. Use blobs to buy new slime arms and to defend yourself! If you buy 3 of the same type of slime arm it will upgrade into a larger version with better abilities!</p>\n<p>Puddle Tendrils drop a puddle that fades over time. If enemy slimes jump through the puddle, they get converted. Upgrades make the puddle last longer.</p>\n<p>Bullet Tendrils shoot slime bullets outward circularly with no defined range. Upgrades make them shoot more bullets in a wider array.</p>\n<p>Wave Tendrils shoot a growing wave that dissipates over time. Upgrades make the wave bigger and last longer.</p>\n<p>Lure Tendrils pull enemies inwards toward it. Upgrades increase the pull and duration.</p>\n\n<p>Created By :<br/>Kyle Purser</p>\n<p>Tyle Padget</p>\n<p>Preston While</p>\n<p>Ben Quigley</p>\n<p>Zach Smith</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/563f250e78783dca2f9cd94ec22b2e33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kylempurser"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
