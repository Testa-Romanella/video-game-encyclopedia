As soon as she announced the jam I immediately knew what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>I totally cheated, and broke all\u00a0the jam rules. I started early and\u00a0spent WAYYYYY more time on this than was possible during the jam. Also, it's uh... not really a Bitsy game? It's a game that\u00a0<em>uses bitsy</em><em> as a graphical interface.</em> (Which for the record, is a horrible misuse of Bitsy that I generally do not recommend).<br/></p>\n<p>I really love @cavern_caravan by @skeleton_hugs. It just has such a wonderful theme, and I found myself making up narratives and characters to fill in the details of the tweets. It's my favorite twitter bot. I also love Oregon Trail. \"I should combine those two!\" I thought. \"That shouldn't take too long!\" (I was very wrong, but I love what I've come up with.)</p>\n<p>Currently, the game is an elaborate slot machine. Or maybe, a game of plinko. After you create your caravan, you can only hope for the best. I plan on continuing working on this after the jam, hopefully adding more player choice/agency.</p>\n<p><strong>(If you find bugs/weirdness, and you can grab the javascript console errors and send that to me, then I love you.)</strong></p>\n<p>@skeleton_hugs also recently shared the source code to the twitter bot, so I now have a mountain of lore to mine for content! <em>Blessed be the Deep Saints!</em></p><p>Made possible with lots of hacks from Sean, a tiny font from Sarah, and Borksy, from me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7ea76ad99065dd0c72391954dfcebe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ayolland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
