Some video gameplay and screenshots have been included.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>2 Unique Hazards:</strong>\u00a0The game includes two types of hazards that do damage to the player. the first is stalagmites and comes in two sizes large and small. The second hazard is an explosive barrel that will take away most of the player's health.</li><li><strong>Moving Platforms:</strong> There is an elevator that moves on an elevator shaft using animation in unity.\u00a0</li><li><strong>currency and vending machine system:\u00a0</strong>an emerald pickup that can be used at a vending machine to either buy a speedy powerup or to refill your health bar costing 10 emeralds each. The vending machines themselves can have up to 3 items in stock with the amount being a random value from one to three.</li><li><strong>speedy powerup:\u00a0</strong>A speedy boots robot module that allows the player to move at a faster speed for a limited amount of time.</li><li><strong>Story Mode:</strong> a story-based tutorial in the first level that teaches you how to play with some final dialogue after you complete the story mode part of the game.</li><li><strong>Endless Mode:</strong> an endless mode that allows you to keep on playing forever and allows you to keep your emeralds and health when you reach another level in endless mode.</li><li><strong>Procedural Generation: </strong>a unique generation script that spawns the platforms, powerups/pickups, hazards, and the teleporter.
