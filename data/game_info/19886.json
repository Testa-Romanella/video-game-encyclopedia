She has put a lot of work into it, but after receiving rejections from several publishers, her enthusiasm for the project is beginning to wane. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHer hope is somewhat rekindled when a publisher who recently rejected her book sends her an SMS, telling Carol that he wants to meet her. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, the publisher is not interested in Carol\u2019s writing skills, but in her aptitude for locating missing persons. He wants to hire her to find a missing eccentric author. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIts obvious to Carol from the very beginning that it\u2019s not an average missing person case. The author\u2019s wife was murdered 6 years ago. Just before his disappearance, a young woman was found murdered, with pages from the author\u2019s latest book stuffed into her mouth.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e369961adfdb3a3933151c6de4474173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 428, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MDNA Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tri Synergy"], "esrb_rating": null}
