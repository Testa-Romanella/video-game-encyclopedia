You can change rails (or lanes) to \r\navoid obstacles, but you character can only run forward and jump.\r\nThe idea is that Furrest, the cat, has played too much with his woolen \r\nballs, and have destroyed too many of them.</p>\n<p><em>Now it's their turn to revenge!</em></p>\n<p>You must try to go as far as possible and avoid crashing on the \"bad\"\r\n woolen balls (the orange things). Also, pick up milk and fishes, as \r\nthey give you 100 points each!</p>\n<p>If you crash 2 times or more, mother woolen ball will start running after you, and if you crash again, it will be game over!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>UP</strong> and <strong>DOWN</strong> arrows are used to <strong>change lanes</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>SPACE</strong> key is used to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Myself, for coding the game and creating the milk, woolen balls and background sprites.</p>\n<p>User <strong>IgnasD</strong>, for creating the meow sound I used.
