You can have fun moments in the game with many map options. Remember the saying: Monkeys are strong together!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Get support from artificial intelligence bots while building your team in the game. Place bot players on your team to strengthen your army. Find and drive and control a number of vehicles only in certain areas of the maps. You can crush the monkeys in the enemy team with your vehicle. You can taste the realism in the game. For example, if you stay too long in the sea, you will drown and die.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game has Free for All, Team Deathmatch and a Grab Banana mode. The most entertaining one among these modes is that both teams are trying to reach. You have limited time to seize these bananas and take them to your area. Since these bananas are located in the area of the map where there is the most combat and action, you may be shot and killed by the enemies while you pick up the banana and transport it to your area!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Gombe Chimpanzee War is a series of violent conflicts between two chimpanzee communities in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, that lasted from 1974 to 1978.
