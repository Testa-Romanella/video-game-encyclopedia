Have you tried to beat the impossible? Impossible Hill offers you these features together. Everything is about seconds. You have to beat impossible times on different levels. <br/><br/>FEATURES: <br/>- 386 different levels with various environments <br/>- Addictive and fun gameplay <br/>- Breathtaking 3D graphics <br/>- Realistic car physics <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: <br/>You have 2 minutes at starting of the game (called as TOTAL TIME). Also all the levels have a base record time (called as BASE TIME) that represented by a ghost car on the track. Your main goal is to overtake the ghost car and defeat base time. <br/><br/>Here comes the tricky part. If your time is less than Base Time, the Total Time is increased by different of your time and Base Time (called Delta Time). But if your time is more than Base Time, the Total Time is decreased by different of your time and Base Time. <br/><br/>Let's see an example: your Total Time is 1:30 minutes, and you didn't reach Base Time by 5 seconds then Delta Time is -5 seconds and your new Total Time is 1:25 minutes. Delta Rec is -5 seconds too because this shows your best Delta Time on the current level. <br/><br/>If your Total Time has been run out, the next level will not be available. That's why you have to beat Base Time as many levels as possible and increase your Total Time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f1890bebf260da821e913205e72b7239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ASK Homework"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ASK HOMEWORK"], "esrb_rating": null}
