(I am SO sorry I didn't get to do any audio!)</p>\n<p><strong>PERSONAL GOALS and CONSTRAINTS</strong></p>\n<p>This game jam came onto my radar while I was thinking about creating Google-Doodle-styled games for non-profits. Therefore, my goal for this particular game jam was to try to create an educational interactive doodle.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0spent MOST of my first day researching the NASA space shuttle. I was going to do a game about performing a check list where the player had to check the shuttle and if they missed anything then the launch would fail. However, after reading through NASA checklists...I was thoroughly confused.</p>\n<p>Luckly I happened across a cool little informational website about how the different components travel across the country over to Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I\u00a0didn't do everything I wanted, but whatevs. I hope you like.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, and thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e0935f8a66c54767180708aa6ee95a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brianheagney"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
