Every time you die, a totem will spawn at the death location and you can hit it to collect a totem that can be used to convert into grave pieces and liquid which can be used to craft weapons and potions. Once you upgraded your equipment, it will be easier for you to get rid of the enemies and reach the end.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Space key - jump</p>\n<p>Z key - attack/reflect bullets</p>\n<p>X key - use shield (you need to get it from the crafting table first to use it)</p>\n<p>C key - open converter/crafting table UI/black door</p>\n<p>1 to 5 keys - interact with UI</p>\n\n<p>Additions</p>\n<p>- Added a shield to the game which will need to be obtained from the crafting table in order to use it.
