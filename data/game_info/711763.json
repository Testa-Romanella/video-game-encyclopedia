It was created in the span of 4 weeks with gamejam style rules (a theme and some constraints).\u00a0<br/><br/>Space Cannel\u00e9 explored the theme \"trop\", as in \"too much\". It starts you off with little amount of buttons and controls, and few enemies, and ramps up both on number of enemies and your own upgrades, amping up the tension as you try to survive as long as you can. <br/><br/>This game was created by Anass Alaoui, Tiziano Maisonhaute, Flavian Z\u00e9miri and Alexandre Hamoir. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7b33b0ac6a420515b57179749218632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7fault Dev Team"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
