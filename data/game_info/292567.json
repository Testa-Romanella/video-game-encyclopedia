Each choice had its own advantages and difficulties. Asteroids, was a mid level choice as a first game, however it provided a good foundation for future projects. Game Maker provided me with significant tutorials to create a good looking and fully functional game of asteroids. While working on the project, other objectives were planned to add to the final such as; a start screen, a safe re-spawn, and an infinite amo cheat code. All objectives were completed in time for the turn in. In an attempt to create a god mode re-spawn would break so\u00a0I could not facilitate this feature.</p>\n<p> Learning to navigating Game Maker was the most time draining process that went into the making of this Asteroids game. As the first project, it was met with a large quantity of simple questions therefor, relatively simple code went into the creation process over a long amount of time. Iterative designs were the main product of all work put into the game. Graphical assets are all original and some audio was found to complete the library. While creating this game, a lot was learned such as time management and one way the development process can play out. From creating this game, the best take away is the ability to quickly prototype things in a two dimensional environment as well as\u00a0not to over\u00a0complicate something that required a relatively simple solution. To avoid mistakes in the future a more simple approaches should be taken.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49c6d803cc712300950a4c0d0112836b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
