{"id": 570596, "slug": "total-breakdown", "name": "Total Breakdown", "name_original": "Total Breakdown", "description": "<p>Total Breakdown is a destruction simulator that lets you choose from a wide variety of weapons and destroy structures with realistic physics*. At this time there are two game modes: casual and challenge.\u00a0Casual mode lets you break stuff with unlimited ammo.\u00a0Challenge mode is all about getting the highest score. Gain points by making construction material fall on the green pads. Plan carefully because you only have a small amount of ammo to work with.</p><p>I plan on streaming most of the game development on the Game Assets Garden\u00a0Twitch\u00a0channel. If you want to get notified when I go live,\u00a0be sure to follow me. I'll also add the 3D models used in Total Breakdown to GameAssetsGarden.com so you can use them in your own projects for free.</p>\n<p>*Please keep in mind that this is a physics simulation game which can be pretty demanding on the CPU/GPU. Some entry-level PCs may experience lag.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0d49088c98c23177806ee8b73a4eafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Assets Garden"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
