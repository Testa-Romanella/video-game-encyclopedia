You must place down interior walls in such a way, that you can organise your ship into rooms containing all of a certain item (and only that item). E.g. create a room containing all of the red objects, and a room containing all the white objects etc.</p><p>WASD (or other for some keyboard layouts) to move</p><p>Left click to place wall</p><p>Right click to destroy wall</p><p>Escape to return to menu (not tested on all keyboard layouts)</p><p>The original intention was to have a slightly surreal, comedic sci-fi styled game, though we were unable to complete the artwork for this.</p><p>This game was a real push to get out of the door on time (and in its current state it's still debatable as to whether I actually managed to do that). After starting one project on Saturday, and realising it would be impossible to complete before the deadline, this was the fresh start on Sunday that I felt was more achievable. Unfortunately, we were unable to get all of the art assets for the game, so it does look a little bland, and the menus were made in around half an hour I believe. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d9/5d962acc90aaebf72eac5c53a0112a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueLlama"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
