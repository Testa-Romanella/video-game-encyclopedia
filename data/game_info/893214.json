Experience the story in a different setting.\u00a0Inspired by a series of shorts I did on Patreon. Enjoy! \u2764\ufe0f</strong></p>\n\n<p>The DLC vaguely follows the idea of the original game, but is less plot-heavy as the main focus is on romance/friendship, for those of you who wanted more of just that.\u00a0</p><p><strong>What's in store:</strong></p><p>- customizable MC: background, name, sprite,\r\n</p>\n<p>- 3 linear snippets\u00a0(one for each character, with a few flavor choices),\r\n</p>\n<p>- around 20k of words (all routes), and approximately 30-50 minutes of playthrough (depending on your\u00a0reading speed),\r\n</p>\n<p>*the routes are more romance-leaning (that means there\u2019s more content if you choose romance), but there are available choices if you\u2019d rather go for the friendly path, if only to learn more abut what happened to MC, as clues are split between the routes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>The ROs, in their new incarnation:</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Name: never ask a Fae for their name\r\n</p>\n<p>Goes by: Reed\r\n</p>\n<p>Bio: the youngest son of the current Queen. Though the last in the long line of succession, he\u2019s spoiled rotten. His ego, likewise, is second to none. Rightly so, one might say, seeing as he\u2019s the unbeatable favorite of not only her Majesty, but also his brother, the Heir Apparent, making \u2018Reed\u2019 as unattainable of an ally as he is desirable.\r\n</p>\n<p>Occupation: \u201clooking pretty\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>Residency: Upper Realm - Cinnabar Court\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Name: never ask a Fae for their name\r\n</p>\n<p>Goes by: Jewel\r\n</p>\n<p>Bio: the eldest of two heirs of a family of a prominent standing, recently demoted during the power shift in the court. Something of a fugitive, she\u2019s well-taught and well balanced: shrewd but helpful, secretive but bold. Sought after if one needs to communicate with the Human Realm.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Occupation: trader/runner\r\n</p>\n<p>Residency: Middle Realm - Pearl Parlor\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Name: never ask a Fae for their name\r\n</p>\n<p>Goes by: Laurent\r\n</p>\n<p>Bio: having discarded his place in the court, Laurent was appointed as a guard, and shortly after climbed to the position of a captain. He might not be the most pleasant conversation partner, but he\u2019s steady and reliable. Despite the Fey\u2019s natural aversion to the martial class - even those who protect the court - Laurent\u2019s admired not only because of his former status but because of his valor.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Occupation: sentry (guard captain)\r\n</p>\n<p>Residency: Lower Realm - Midnight Court\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>1. Can I play this DLC without having played Perfumare (VN)?\r\n</p>\n<p>A: Well, I can\u2019t stop you, but the DLC is intended for the players who already know the characters and the plot of the base game, and want to spend some extra time with their ROs without the burden of a heavier plot.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visual Novel Engine:\u00a0Ren'Py by\u00a0Tom Rothamel</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Writing, UI, coding, art:</strong>\u00a0[PDRRook]\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>[Twitter]\u00a0[Tumblr]\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Proofreaders/editors/betas:</strong>\u00a0[Cassiel] [Dom]\u00a0[Steph 'Jeneara' M]\u00a0[victoriel]\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>And a huge thank you to my Patrons:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sybylladella, Reid, Queen of Antiva, Mad_as_a_Hatter, K.Voight, haledamage, LizzyTinker, Aonith, Shuris, freya, Twirly Muffin, kingdom-dance, Estel D., Anna Maria, del, GeeHoney, S.'Jeneara' Mason, J.
