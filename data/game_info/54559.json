It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) purchased the company&#39;s assets three months later. Backstage Assault features commentary by Tony Schiavone and Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan. The game is distinguished by the fact that all gameplay takes place outside of a standard wrestling ring. This approach was very poorly received and the game sold only 200,000 copies. A PlayStation 2 port was under development, but cancelled.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-01T08:27:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/635/63590cc6aadba8b7a27aa8f674f9c29a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Kodiak Interactive"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
