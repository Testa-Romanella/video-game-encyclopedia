The game is actually raising fund on kickstarter. Check it out if you like the game! You may also want to visit the website as there's every social network links)<br/></p><p>The only purpose of this demo is to discover the gameplay of Starxium 20XX. It's not optimized, probably full of bugs and missing 95% of the features of the final game. Just enjoy your play, don't be too picky on the current state of the game, and remember it's just a free pre-alpha demo :)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Starxium 20XX</strong> is a capture the point (your team needs to stay on a point and repel your opponent), where the point is a <strong>moving convoy</strong> that runs at <strong>200km/h</strong> in the middle of a big highway. It's <strong>not</strong> a racing game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game is highly reminiscent of the <strong>80s</strong> with its neon lit nights and boasts original <strong>synthwave music</strong>. Its strong visual and sound identity allow the game to be appreciated by a growing community of <strong>retro lovers</strong> who crave the <strong>80s pop culture</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>It is a multiplayer game meant for <strong>esport</strong>: it\u2019s made to be as fun to <strong>play</strong> as it is to<strong> watch</strong>. The main game mode is played with 4 players versus 4. You'll need some <strong>strategy</strong> and good <strong>communication</strong> to fight the enemy team.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Everyone gets the <strong>same car</strong> but what you do with it is your business. And you can <strong>totally customize it</strong>, not only the skin, but everything from the wheels to the motor, from the chassis to the battery, and so on. Each part comes from one of the <strong>27 country manufacturers</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>To repel your opponents, you can simply <strong>rush over them</strong>. But to be <strong>more efficient</strong>, you can charge your battery by doing <strong>aerial tricks</strong> and use it to display \"hologram\" such as a <strong>bumper</strong> that return 5x the force of the collision to an opponent, or a <strong>jumper</strong> that allow your teammates to go on the other side of the convoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a797c669399e9e8116e455102ac4c34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Herobrine"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
