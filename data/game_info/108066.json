I am a beginner in programming, so things will get glitchy. Blue team is a bit rigged, but in that case, either go out of bounds or go to the pause menu and restart the game. The red controls are arrow keys and blue is WASD. Enjoy the game. Please in the comments give me some suggestions on how to make the game a bit better or what my next game should be. This game was made by one 12 year old boy. If you have criticism, please don't swear or curse, just give me some friendly feedback.
