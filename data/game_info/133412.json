Man and machine lose free will, as humanity is enslaved, to an unforgiving rule of law and order. Humanity and machines reach a standstill as everything is forced to stay the same. Goodbye change, goodbye dreams.</p>\n<p>A malfunction causes a few rogue humans to disconnect from the control of the neuromancer. These few outcasts are hunted to be re-enslaved. They control bits of the neuroweb and use it to fight back. The forces against them are strong but the instinct to survive is stronger.</p>\n\r\nGame description:\r\n<p>Like tower defenses ?
