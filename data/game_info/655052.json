Enter his lair and overcome his zombie hoards to earn your fame and fortune!</p>\n<p>User the arrow keys or WASD to move around. Moving into an enemy will attack it. Collect Swords to increase your attack power, potions to replenish your health, and treasure to eventually unlock the final encounter.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was inspired by the 7DayRogulike game jam. As I missed the latest jam I wanted to challenge myself and create something anyway. Technically I went slightly over 7 days and completed the game in 8 2-3 hr evening sessions. You can read my write up on development of the project here.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f67ae945c644b1ec93bed373dd23fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GamePasta"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
