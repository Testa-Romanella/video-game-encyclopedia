Sad.</p>\n<p>So we made this game. They still can have a win-win relationship.<br/>The crocodile is stuck and hungry. The birdie is hungry too.<br/>In the wild city, food is kinda hard to eat for birdie. The crocodile can break every food so birdie decided to get food for him. So birdie can eat some nice food for herself too.<br/><br/><br/>You control this cute one. The birdie!<br/>Bring the food to hungry Crocodile and eat crumbles for your health too!<br/></p>\n<p>Use your time wisely.
