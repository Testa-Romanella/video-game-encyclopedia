The player controls one character at a time, and tries to brave the world ahead of him. But it&#39;s a race against time and traps and beasts and obstacles, challenges which ultimately prove impossible for a lone person. But persistence and teamwork pays off. This is a 2D platform/medroidvania game about how a family generation work to improve the lives of the next.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T19:02:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893624e50ee832bf14f987374c3075f5.jpg", "website": "https://www.indiedb.com/games/viktor-the-nth/downloads/1st-version", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
