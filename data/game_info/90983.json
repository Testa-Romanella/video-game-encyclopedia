{"id": 90983, "slug": "goddess", "name": "Goddess", "name_original": "Goddess", "description": "<p>\r\n\tHi, my name is Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n and I'm the creator of Goddess! Back in 2001 when I was 14 years old, I created a story called Carisma, this concept followed me over the years until it became Goddess in 2007.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGoddess is an adventure and puzzle game I'm developing in my spare time.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game tells the sad love story of a princess, who will have to go through a world filled with beautiful and lively places, as well as other full of sadness and sorrows to find the person who she most loves in the world. Many puzzles, moral decisions, freedom to go anywhere you want and a run 'n' hide combat system, since she doesn't fight, will be some of the main features in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2011 I started working again in this old project, hoping this time I'd manage to complete it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt isn't necessary to download or install anything. The game runs directly on your browser by pressing the \"Download\" button. You can use your keyboard, gamepad or touch screen to play.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're using the itch app, just install the \"App\" file. This will create a shortcut on your library.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMy goal is to achieve a completely free game with content suitable for all ages, and when required, there will be censored content available only for 17+.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you want, you can support this project by donating $1.99 USD or more. Your donation will help me to pay the game server and to continue developing Goddess. In return you'll be able to unlock the censored content and the locked gallery, as well as access to the alpha version that I'll launch in the future, concept art and extras.</p>\n<p>You can also \r\n\tget this content and your name in the credits by helping with 3d modeling, original music, translations, publicity or any other thing.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments. I'll be pleased to answer you! My English is poor, but I'm sure we will be able to understand each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThank you so much for supporting Goddess! I hope you like this beautiful project.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t-Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c293070348923877e412bb44bc6e8591.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
