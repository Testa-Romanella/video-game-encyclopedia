Each mission is narrated by a real person, while you experience these same moments as if you were them.</p>\n<p>Experience the uncertainty of combat through a groundbreaking Procedural Architecture system that re-shapes the battlefield every time you play. Every room and every building changes every time. So, just like actual combat, you&#39;ll never know what to expect.</p>\n<p>Overcome insurgents by executing authentic tactics with your team. One tap orders your team to fix enemies in place with suppressive fire (so you can flank), breach and clear rooms, and more. The Go Command makes it as easy to direct your team as it is to fire your weapon.</p>\n<p>Experience how modern war is really fought, through the eyes of those who were actually there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-10-11T08:54:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/efa/efaef5202fae4a85dbab201b5376891f.jpg", "website": "https://www.sixdays.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 11, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Highwire Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Vectura Games", "Victura"], "esrb_rating": null}
