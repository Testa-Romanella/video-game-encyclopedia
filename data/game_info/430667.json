But this fire is peculiar, like no other. This fire will defend you from creatures lurking in the dark, repelling them with its light. But its special in another way as well. This fire is nourished not by lumber or tinder, but instead the finest dishes the world has to offer. But should it not receive the desired food, it will burn out, leaving you open and defenseless. In order to stay alive and keep your fire alive, scavenge your world for ingredients, and use those, plus your instructions, to cook dishes to perfection, making sure to put in the exact ingredients and cooking for the perfect time. Craft all three dishes to survive the night.</p>\n<p>There are 6 possible recipes to make, each with a unique set of required ingredients and a specific amount of cook time.
