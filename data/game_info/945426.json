Never done anything full-scale in RPG Maker, so I\u00a0wanted to try as an exercise. One of my main objectives is to not add anything new in terms of graphics, so no custom/DLC tilesets/face sprites. I\u00a0wanna see what I can do with just the vanilla stuff.</p>\n<p>This is only meant as proof of concept and not meant to be good, at all. I mean, I\u00a0won't make it bad on purpose, but I'm not gonna go out of my way to make it not bad, if you catch my drift.</p>\n<p>It's not anywhere near complete, nor playable. At the moment it's basically a walking simulator with bugs, and &lt;10 min of playtime.\u00a0<em>Hmmm... should I file this under \"5 minute games\"...?</em><br/></p>\n<p>Oh, also, I don't know how to do game\u00a0versions.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\nHow do I play this?\r\n<p><em>&gt; I mean, you really shouldn't...</em></p>\n<p>If you're looking for the installation instructions, wrong place.\u00a0 But if you've never played an RPG Maker game:</p>\n<ul><li>Z/X to select/cancel<ul><li>Enter also works for selection, I think</li></ul></li><li>Arrow keys to move around / navigate menus</li><li>... I\u00a0forgot the rest. I'll put the instructions later. I\u00a0think Esc does something.</li><li>Alt-F4 to quickly close the game (or any other piece of software you don't particularly like)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nWarnings\r\n<p><em>&gt; Yippee.</em></p>\n<ul><li>Cuss words (Wow! F***!)<ul><li>Don't show your mom.</li></ul></li><li>Horrible story (generic)<ul><li>There isn't any yet.</li></ul></li><li>Horrible characters (generic)<ul><li>There's only 1 so far. 2 if you count the scarecrow, and 3 if you count the player.</li></ul></li><li>Horrible dialogue<ul><li>There's blatant 4th wall breaking.</li></ul></li><li>Sarcasm<ul><li>A metric ton of it.</li></ul></li><li>A bad player experience in general<ul><li>If a game has fishing in it, you know you're in for a ride.
