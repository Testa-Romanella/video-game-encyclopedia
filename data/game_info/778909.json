So, if it crashes, or there is a lot of lag in the game, be aware that it is for this reason</p>\n<p><strong>If the Windows version is in the same situation, please contact me.</strong><br/></p><p>Dev page:\u00a0\u00a0https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/my-game-a-little-about-development/31980</p><p>Buy me a Coffe?\u00a0buymeacoffee.com/?via=project89</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7e2300595e4b824c3e8ec6e16add9df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Willian Holtz"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
