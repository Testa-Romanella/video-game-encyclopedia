Rockets are incoming and you are the only one who can stop them. Original action with numerous weapons is here.<br />\nInterceptor Complete Edition may be japanese but it shouldn\u2019t make you stop understanding the game. You can choose from 3 modes, but single player and survival modes are the most interesting. The first takes you into four levels where you have to destroy all the rockets. You can take only 4 weapons and one of them is bonus. Their description is in Japanese but you can orient according the names. The battle view is side one and shooting the weapons is tricky, the bullets and explosive shells take time to reach the targets. With the end of every level you have to defeat one some bosses too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T18:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb9291b051c2f87c97c300a6e6e2cd73.jpg", "website": "https://freegame-mugen.jp/shooting/game_1836.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
