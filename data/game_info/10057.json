Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory.  Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different.<br />\nIn the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America&#39;s finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army&#39;s seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it&#39;s one thing to make history, but quite another to change it.<br />\n...Do you have what it takes to command?<br />\nKey features:<br />\nExperience WWII warfare on an epic, cinematic stage; that truly captures the intensity and scale of the battlefield.<br />\nTake Command of an entire armoured force consisting of up to 1000 soldiers, tank divisions, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and air force.<br />\nPlayers can choose between two different campaign modes offering completely different storyline, missions, objectives and environments.<br />\nExperience the unique dynamic camera that allows players to command troops over huge geographical scale whilst maintaining movie-like vistas and detail.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2009-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-21T13:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5e3/5e3e7f513ca7b9ac47aea37e5be17e5f.jpg", "website": "http://www.orderofwar.com", "rating": 2.44, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 31, "owned": 688, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 601, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wargaming.net"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
