Yet, a sinister force, envious of this harmony, sought to disrupt it. Shattering the Sigil into two pieces - the Ring of Unity and the Ring of Duality - the malevolent power unleashed a rift in reality, causing the world to fracture into two parallel dimensions. As the Champion of Cyanida, you must embark on a perilous journey to recover the rings, reforge the Sigil of Harmony, and restore balance to the fractured realms of Cyronia.</p>\r\nMovement\r\nBasic movement\r\n<p>Use WASD to move/strafe (or numpad 8, 4, 6, 2).</p>\n<p>Use QE to rotate 90\u00b0 (or the numpad 7, 9)</p>\r\nAttack/Interact\r\n<p>Use the spacebar (or numpad 5) to attack or interact with objects.</p>\r\nHealing\r\n<p>Use the left control key (or enter on the\u00a0numpad) to consume a healing potion.</p>\r\nUsing the Ring of Duality\r\n<p>You will need to find rift energy to charge the Ring of Duality.

The boots of \"Limited time compression\" will give you instant tile movement, however since time will be compressed, this also affects enemies.</p>\n<p>You will receive the \"Ring of Duality\" that will enable you to switch between the two dimensions, but there is a small catch to it. The ring\u00a0requires \"Rift-Energy\" so collecting\u00a0this may help you progress towards the arch evil as they are slight differences between the realities.</p>\n<p>Your task is to defeat the evil, claim the \"Ring of Unity\" and reforge the \"Sigil of Harmony\" once again.\u00a0</p>\r\nStretch goals for the jam\r\n<ol><li>Riddels, doors and traps.
