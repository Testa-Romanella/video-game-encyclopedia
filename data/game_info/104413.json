A space dimension portal has been opened and strange beasts from the 1% dimension are getting through.</p>\n<p>It's all up to my Nuclear Octopus to save the universe, using his magical ink to send them back to their own dimension.</p>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>-HOLD DOWN the fire buttons, TAP the movement buttons<br/>-Destroy all things coming out of the portal<br/>-Collect the things that look like pills. They are steroidipus and they give you rapid fire<br/>-Get a high score<br/>-You get one multicoloured explodipus per level (think smartbomb) to use when there's nothing left but hope.<br/>-Reach the end of the game and defeat the boss</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard controls</strong></p>\n<p>-Use A and D to choose firing direction left or right.<br/>-UP and DOWN arrow keys move.. yep, up and down.<br/>-Press SPACE to activate multicoloured explodipus.

You get one per level.</p>\r\nClosing arguments:\r\n<p>Walking into an amusement arcade during the 1980's overwhelmed the senses. The audio from each arcade machines screamed out for attention, each one fighting to grab the passer by, to feed it with coins.</p>\n<p>My Nuclear Octopus is what might have happened had I been born a few years earlier and landed a job designing arcade games in 1984. It's loud, it's simple to pick up and it's tough as old badgers. The graphics are crunchy old sprites, something you might see in an old Commodore 64 game, a BBC Micro game or maybe even a 1980's arcade.</p>\n<p>The logic is simple - you play for a few minutes, you get as far as you can, the game ends. Next time, you play again and try to beat your score. Somewhere along the way, the rest of the world disappears and you find yourself one with the Octopus, in some kind of harmony with the game as, for a short time at least, 100% of your focus goes into keeping back the marauders from another dimension. </p>\n<p>Lose yourself for a short time, just like we did in the old days.</p>\r\nWhat the critics say:\r\n<p>If you really need to hear it from someone else how much fun My Nuclear Octopus is, try an 8/10 from ZOMGPLAY:</p>\n<p>ZOMGPLAY.COM</p>\n<p>Or another 8/10 from United Front Gaming:</p>\n<p>United Front Gaming</p>\n<p>If you hadn't already heard, PC Gamer (yeah, the awesome PC Gamer) featured it in their Free games of the week section:</p>\n<p>PC Gamer Free games of the week<br/></p>\r\nUpdates\r\n<p>My Extremely Nuclear Octopus BETA 1.0</p>\n<p>Think of this as the same game through different eyes, featuring boss battles, super enhanced eye-candy and a whole host of other bits.
