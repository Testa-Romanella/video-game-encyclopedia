It was largely inspired by the final season of samurai jack that was released at the time.<br/><br/>Right now you can jump, block, and attack. Use WASD to move, left click to attack, and right click to block.<br/><br/>I think it would a lot of fun to revisit this concept, but I can't see myself ever having the time. Bit of a shame, as this world was pretty cool.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8ff14ec843b4e61f5e23d67875d0063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nabladeveloper"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
