Though\u00a0there are\u00a0<em>some</em>\u00a0things\u00a0I'm not\u00a0too happy about (like the abrupt ending),\u00a0I\u00a0can't\u00a0go back and\u00a0tweak\u00a0it\u00a0now, since I\u00a0lost I lost most of the\u00a0project files. If I still had them, I'd just build the browser version and upload that, but...\u00a0<strong> q.p<br/></strong></p>\n<p>My main goal was to make something that stretched the extremely dull turn-based system that RMMV comes with. I decided to go with a weapon-switching mechanic, where many character-themes are rolled together. (For example, the healer and nuker are the same character, \u00a0but not at the same time.)</p>\n<p>I also wanted to experiment writing stuff for the two main characters, both through their dialog and their mechanics. I hope you like it.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, <strong><em>SAVE OFTEN</em></strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>Here is the original thread on the RPG Maker forums.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f08/f08c87bbd3fc08d4b39ede17e5dd1aba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Autofire"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
