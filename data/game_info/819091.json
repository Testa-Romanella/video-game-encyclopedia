As in, the terrain height map, the cookie spawn locations and spawn numbers, the tree spawn location, and also the mob spawn locations, numbers spawned, and path given to roam. This allows uniqueness for everyone, and also\u00a0replayability.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T15:18:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e540f00ae5cc2e3ffb7543def16f9c3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rdotdev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
