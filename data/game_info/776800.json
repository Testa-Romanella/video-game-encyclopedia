Either way, it sits on your kitchen table now, aching to be solved. But every solution and every sliding panel plays with your senses, like the box is trying to solve and dismantle you in turn. Every solution promises danger. Worst of all, the <strong>Ivy</strong> won't stop crawling...</p>\n<p><strong>The Ivy Puzzle</strong> is a short and surreal horror text game with multiple endings, and was made primarily to teach myself Twine. It's quite simple and more of an experiment, but maybe it'll unsettle you a little bit all the same. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T09:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/72523a748e1d375fc74a67f5fc95d5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nik Theorin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
