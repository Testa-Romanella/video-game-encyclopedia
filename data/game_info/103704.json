My project was called <em>Space Bubble Cat</em>, a very personal piece\u00a0about a lonely cat who floats through space.</p>\n<p>This was intended to be a submission for\u00a0the June 2018 Bitsy Jam (theme: <em>Space Whales</em>), where I was inspired to revisit this project, update and finish it from its original version into an interactive Bitsy\u00a0comic. However, I was not able to finish by the deadline of the jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Content warning:\u00a0</strong>Sad</p>\n<p><strong>How to Read:</strong>\u00a0Move to the bottom-right corner to turn the\u00a0page.\u00a0Read all speech bubbles in a panel before moving onto the next. As a general rule, speech bubbles are read from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>Music: \"daydream\" and \"apprehension\", from the album <em>Think</em> by motherbear (the album has since been taken offline, but I encourage you to\u00a0please check out her other stuff as well).</p>\n<p>Thanks to Ayo for Borsky, Sean &amp; Ducky for hacks, Em for playtesting,\u00a0and\u00a0Adam for making Bitsy.</p>\n<p>Space Bubble Cat also has a twitter and an instagram, which are rather inactive right now, but I would love to start them up again sometime soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5edab329c5ee28edabd79cafce27c857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emma Dee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
