(Still learning this whole \"upload your game\" thing). The box will update throughout the game with new information.</p><p>This is my first game and was originally created for a class project. The game is set in the countryside of Nagsel where a sudden and inexplicable undead rise has occurred. Magic has also been rendered obsolete by an unknown entity. The player must gather the Staff of Dimensions and return it to a safe location. Unfortunately, the player is also a wizard who cannot use their magic abilities and must rely on their quick reflexes to avoid the zombies and collect the Staff of Dimensions before they are swarmed.<br/></p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dde0a519e3817541a4db61dd2fa32cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aftermathic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
