{"id": 915251, "slug": "taiko-tag", "name": "Taiko Tag", "name_original": "Taiko Tag", "description": "<p>Taiko Tag is a 1v1 local multiplayer game where each player plays as a Taiko drummer engaged in an intense drumming competition. Players will go back and forth playing 4 beats of rhythm by hitting the center and the rim of their drum to a simple background theme. Once the first player performs their set, the opposing player will be required to repeat it back to them, then perform another 4-beat set for the first player to repeat in turn. This will continue back and forth until the game reaches a set tempo, ending the game and showing players their note accuracy and who outperformed the other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T07:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd609998dc675efbdf6abb5b0c6f0461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamPlasmaFish", "SubspaceJones"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
