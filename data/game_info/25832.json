This is an interactive board game for all ages and \n      for one to eight players. The object of the game is to complete all the \n      challenges set by Family &amp; Friends Party. The first to complete them all \n      is the winner! Teams take turns to play. The team selected in each turn \n      must complete a specific challenge. The challenge will be played by one \n      or two players in the team depending on the type of challenge you have \n      been given. Nevertheless, the other the players in the team can help and \n      support you. You can never get enough help! There are six different \n      \u201cSingle\u201d challenges. These challenges must be played cooperatively by \n      members of the same team. Sometimes, Family &amp; Friends Party will also \n      suggest playing \u201cVersus\u201d challenges, which must be played competitively \n      by all the teams at the same time.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/465/46536aa42a75f56761eab63441527da6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Gammick Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
