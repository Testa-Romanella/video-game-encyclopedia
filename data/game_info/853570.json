You don't have enough Fire Feathers for the whole maze, so you'll have to risk going into the darkness not knowing what you can find. The location of the enemies and traps are random, so you'll need some luck to get to the end. As you get to know the maze it will become easier, but a false step can kill you instantly anyway.</p>\n<p>Good luck.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Legend says that whoever finds the old King's crown in the Dark Maze will become the new King.</p>\n<p>However, the magical darkness that fills the maze can't be eliminated with conventional methods.</p>\n<p>You got hold of some Fire Feathers, magical items that create light and fire.</p>\n<p>They are not enough to light the whole maze, but you decided to take the risk.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEYS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD for the selection direction<br/>SPACE to select</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Select a room next to the one you're in and decide what to do there. You can:<br/>- Use 1 Feather and light up the room<br/>- Use 2 Feathers and explode the room<br/>- Risk walking into darkness<br/>- There's also a button to cancel the selection if you don't want that room</p>\n<p>Lighting up a room will have just that effect, you can see what's in the room and decide what to do. Exploding a room on the other hand has more effects: If there's a zombie, you will kill it. If there's a treasure chest, you will break it. In any case, you will still light up the room.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enter a dark room and there's a trap, you will lose health. If there's a zombie it will kill  you instantly. If there's a treasure chest, you won't know, so you won't open it.</p>\n<p>If you enter a lit up room and there's a trap, nothing will happen, you can avoid it. If there's a zombie you can fight it and \u00a0lose some health, although you can still explode it from outside and kill the zombie. If there's a treasure chest you'll open it and get Fire Feathers or recover health.</p>\n\n<p>KNOW BUGS</p>\n<p>- If you press two directions at the same time, the selector can still appear even if you're not pressing any button. Just press again that direction and it will disappear.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T12:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c12443c81bec6f9512eb13c1683bd861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yurei S.D."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
