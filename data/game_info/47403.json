Taking place 150 years in the future, mankind has finally acquired all the necessary technologies to contour space. The real question is, does humanity have what it takes to thrive in the unknown reaches of the solar system?<br/><br/> The main goal of the game is to reach Alpha Centauri, in search of a rumored, advanced human society who had supposedly created an Artificial Intelligence believed to be astronomically more advanced than modern scientists can comprehend. <br/><br/> Interstellar Prime will have a strong emphasis on sci-fi realism, the technologies you will see in the game are all based on real science and genuine projects that are being studied by scientists today. This means there will not be things like Teleportation, Mind Reading, or Warp Drives, for example.<br/><br/> The game will lead you to explore the real questions of conquering space,  does humanity have the ethics, responsibility, or capability to be a space-faring species? This game will take you on an action-packed journey in a scientifically driven story filled with mystery, discovery, and thought-provoking gameplay. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Merging three massive game genre's is a challenge, but its that pressure that motivates us to deliver an immersive and revolutionary experience. An experience that will put you into the shoes of a 22nd century starship captain, and with such an exciting role comes many obstacles to overcome. As you pioneer the stars, you will learn that there is much more to being a captain than just exploration, you can lead a faction, forge alliances, wage war, build your own structures on planets, start your own mining company, found new and profitable trade routes, uncover a deep and eerie mystery of a long lost advanced human society, and much, much more. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Starship control: The bridge is where you command every aspect of your mission. It is where you can set navigational destination, manually pilot the ship, and enter a battle command mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Interplanetary travel: Navigational map allows you to plot courses to travel through the solar system using the Hohmann transfer method. You must have enough Fusion Propellant to perform the necessary acceleration to perform the interplanetary transfer. One unit of Fusion Propellant allows you to travel one Astronomical Unit (AU).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Living quarter: For your living quarter, you can upgrade it with decorations and trophies as well as a personal 3D printer to make modifications to your weapons and armor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The turbo lift: The starship you start with in the game is about the size of a medium size ocean liner with multiple levels. The turbo lift will allow you to get to any of the levels. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Interceptor: You can dock/undock smaller vessels to the starship. At any point, you can get in and out of the fighter spacecraft to perform an EVA in Zero-Gravity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>EVA (Extravehicular Activity): Your EVA suit is equipped with Plasma Propulsion nozzles which allow you to maneuver around in vacuum Zero-Gravity environment. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>G-Compensation: The Plasma Propulsion nozzles on the EVA suit also creates a downward force perpendicular to the asteroid surface you land on, allowing the wearer to walk around as if there were gravity. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Building base on Mars: Once a command module lands on the surface, the command module can quickly 3D print additional modules using the iron-rich soil on Mars. This allows you to build a mining base capable of harvesting large amounts of resources at a time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Defending the base: Enemy factions will attack to try and take away your resources, this is where you have to use strategy and upgrade your base with better tech.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Putting it all together: As a result of 3 genres combined in a single seamless gameplay, INTERSTELLAR PRIME aims to offers a unique experience that is both familiar and new all at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Next Millennium<br/>The year is 2167, man lives peacefully on earth with the advancement of technology creating free energy and the abundance of food and prosperity throughout the earth. An efficient governing system with all political barriers neutralized through the power of the free market and a regulation of the United Earth Federation. Mankind can now set their eyes solely on conquering Space and venture out to the solar system. Key technologies that made space travel a possibility are nuclear fusion, 3D metal printing, carbon magnets which create artificial gravity, virtual reality, food computing, and genetic engineering. Many factions rise for the race to the stars, each with their own agenda. It is the gold-rush and the wild wild west of the 22nd century. However space is vast, no form of law or government of any kind could ever extend to enforce whoever is out there.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eeb/eeb18c346f359c3648c06f3a64046ff4.jpg", "website": "http://www.interstellar-prime.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamcatcher Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dreamcatcher Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
