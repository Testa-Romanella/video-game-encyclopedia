Ironically, building flat grounds requires a lot of ressources.</p><p>By playing this game, you can experiment this fact in a world which is not made for a wheel. Be a duck, with legs and wings, and you'll see that it's much more easy to get to the end !</p><p>--------------------<br/></p><p>Sources :</p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_locomotion_...</p>     DirtyBiology<p>(don't forget the english subtitles ;) )</p><p>http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/22/12/a...</p><p>Developed by TeamZBLAH with 6 persons for Ludum Dare 36.<br/></p><p>Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3cdc895b790fce618caba8874fe505b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zblah"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
