As students we decided to start an initiative called #Games4Australia where we created a charity game in one week or less in order to raise awareness for the ongoing crisis.\u00a0 We ourselves are half a world away, but believe we can still have an impact.</p>\n\n<p>Support the people fighting to rescue and shelter the wildlife go visit <br/></p>\n\n<p>https://www.wires.org.au/ <br/></p>\n<p>Find out what you can do to help.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Are you an aspiring developer or professional then we urge to join our Games4Australia discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/X2vTrQr<br/></p>\n<p>We are looking to add more games: https://games4australia.weebly.com/<br/></p>\n\n<p>We manage to squeeze this game out in one week.
