It is a successor to Qix, with extra features and a futuristic science fiction aesthetic, rather than Qix&#39;s abstract geometry style; the player pilots a small spaceship named &quot;Monotros&quot; instead of a Stix, and the enemies come in the form of various aliens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T04:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded4b73ca6523c19fcd08690be401d49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.83, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Genesis", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "Wii", "PC"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
