We would really appreciate it!\u00a0\r\n\n<p><strong>In this local co-op puzzle platformer, grab a friend and enter the magical world of Rodentia, where you'll play as two legendary assassin mice on a perilous mission to poison a human prince.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Become Salt and Pepper, the twin assassin mice of prophecy, and embark on a journey they were born for. Collect peanuts to give the tyrannical Prince Nicholas a deadly allergic reaction, and end the bloody war between humans and mice. The Kingdom of Rodentia is counting on you, so cheese don't fail!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Work together to teleport, tinker, and tiptoe your way through the dusty bowels of a castle storeroom. An \"every mouse for themselves\" policy won't work here - put your lives in each other's fuzzy little paws!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Face a myriad of puzzles that will test your wits and leave you scratching your whiskers. Pressure plates, mouseholes, building blocks, and more - just what kind of storeroom is this? Use both your brains and your brawn, or risk walking away with your tail between your legs.<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Use your magic to swap places with items in the level!</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Build yourself a friend to help get to hard to reach places!</strong>\n\n<br/>\n<strong>Pepper</strong><strong>Salt</strong><strong>Movement</strong><strong>A , D &amp; W to move and jump<br/></strong><strong>J, L &amp; I to move and jump<br/></strong><strong>Ability</strong><strong>E:\u00a0 Create a dummy friend!<br/>Q: Destroy dummy friend...</strong><strong>N: Swap places with an item in the level!</strong>\n<p><strong>Other: R to reset current level</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are Bitmapped Studios, a group of 2nd year game dev &amp; game art students!
