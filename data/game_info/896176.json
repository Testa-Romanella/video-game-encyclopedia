The original pulpcraft was made by (squidgoddev) and it is a perfect example of some of the awesome things you can do in pulp. that was about 8 months ago and no more updates are coming to the game while he works on more awesome games in the sdk, He said he was fine with people updating the game so I thought I would take it upon myself. To do just that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I would like to create the game around the community if you have any suggestions, content ideas, coding solutions or if you found any bugs let me know and I\u2019ll do my best to implement stuff into the game.</p>\n<p>(((Version 1.1)))</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>(0)This is a small, but first of many updates coming to pulp craft. First off I decided to start the player off with less health so that finding food and making bread is something you would want to do first before venturing off into the cave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(0)Apples now randomly fall from trees when chopped instantly giving you 1 health when consumed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(0)There are now more areas to explore. Instead of just the starting room and the cave. This will hopefully open more ways to play and enjoy the game as it\u2019s further expanded. Maybe you want to build a bigger base that spans multiple rooms or a massive forest it\u2019s up to you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(0)A new biome being a village where villagers live and build wooden settlements. Villagers are friendly npcs you can talk to and sometimes they will give you items.</p>\n<p>(0) Some subtle music also plays whether\u00a0you are on land or in the cave.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T19:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a108d8e9dc2342b7cd9e2eb7deccb372.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NostalgicAubrey"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
