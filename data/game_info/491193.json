{"id": 491193, "slug": "tyrannis", "name": "Tyrannis", "name_original": "Tyrannis", "description": "In Tyrannis, you play as the commander of either an army of overstretched mercenaries or an outnumbered rebel force across a dystopian America.<br/><br/>Tyrannis features twenty-one regions for you to defend or liberate, twenty-seven different factions with different abilities to encourage different strategies, as well as an AI with a modifiable aggression, offensiveness, and randomness on a per-player basis.<br/><br/>All for you and up to seven other players to fight with in local or online multiplayer.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Tyrannis' turn-based strategic gameplay pits armies of overstretched mercenaries against outnumbered rebel forces. Through asymmetric gameplay, the mercenaries will run Search and Destroy missions to hopefully root out the rebels, while the rebels themselves work to raid their enemies and liberate the country from the Caesar's hired guns.<br/><br/>Or if neither side is able to achieve a decisive victory, the players controlling the most regions or states will decide the victors.<h3>Online Multiplayer</h3><br/>While up to eight players can play on the same computer, Tyrannis has an online multiplayer that can connect up to eight players with only the host's IP address. And a save file, should the players want to continue where they left off.<br/><br/>Of course, should one of the players be unable to make it to the next session, the other players can always replace them with an AI to hold the fort until then.<h3>Post-Launch Content</h3><br/>Tyrannis' development doesn't stop with the launch, and it won't be limited to bug fixes and balancing.<br/><br/>For free, of course.<br/><br/><ul><li>Custom Faction Creator</li></ul><ul><li>Reconnaissance Skirmish Game Mode</li></ul><ul><li>AI Profile Overhaul</li></ul><ul><li>Hardcore Insurgency Skirmishes</li></ul><ul><li>Custom Map Editor</li></ul><br/>And these are only the major updates.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T00:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7ce17a13be169e6e87d0cfc43c53564d.jpg", "website": "https://cghone.com/tyrannis/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cGh ONE"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["cGh ONE"], "esrb_rating": null}
