Current gameplay features build mode and sandbox mode. A basic assortment of parts are available including wheels, tracks, wings, and walker legs. Players can design their own vehicles and test them out in sandbox against a handful of AI enemies.</p>\n<p>This is a game I've worked on for fun in my free time. I'd like the get the multiplayer running next so people can play against each other. I am aware there are some other games out there that have already explored the territory Mechana enters. While I enjoyed some parts of those games, I have my own vision for Mechana and do not intend to simply recreate every aspect of them.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T11:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834f1cac6fc8eaf29335288c10be9763.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bronze_Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
