{"id": 811678, "slug": "jumping-jack-retroremake", "name": "Jumping Jack - RetroRemake", "name_original": "Jumping Jack - RetroRemake", "description": "<p>Originally by Imagine Software in 1983, this is a remake of the classic Jumping Jack, a very early platformer on the Spectrum and Atari 8-bit machines. This is an homage to the original, attempting to stay close to the gameplay and intent of the original, but updating graphics, sound and other elements to match modern machine capabilities where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Jumping Jack knows a rhyme, a four verse limerick.\u00a0Unfortunately he is unwilling to recite it unless you help\u00a0him scale the levels to the top of the screen. Only by\u00a0helping him through all twenty screens will you learn the\u00a0entire rhyme. For each screen completed he will tell you\u00a0two lines.</p>\n<p>Jack is faced with eight layers initially containing only two\u00a0moving gaps, the gap moving leftwards travels upwards\u00a0whilst the gap moving to the right travels downwards.</p>\n<p>Jack must jump through the gaps above him whilst\u00a0avoiding falling through the gaps below.\u00a0Jack can only move upwards by jumping through the\u00a0gap above but he can also move left and right. Should he\u00a0run off the edge of the screen he will wrap around to the\u00a0other edge. Should he fall down a layer he will bang his\u00a0head and remain unconscious for a period of time during\u00a0which he cannot move. Every time he arrives at the\u00a0bottom of the screen unconscious he loses a life.</p>\n<p>At each successful jump a new gap appears at random -\u00a0the first three new gaps descend then the next three\u00a0ascend - up to a maximum of eight gaps. On making a\u00a0successful jump at the top layer the 'next level' sequence\u00a0is entered, and the next part of the rhyme is given.</p>\n<p>Hazards will begin to appear after the first level - one\u00a0initially, then two right up to a maximum of twenty, one\u00a0for each level completed. They all ascend and if Jack\u00a0collides with a hazard he will be knocked unconscious.</p>\n<p>Controls are left, right and up, space to start.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f90/f90ff4749c04a759aef2838cbc495e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Indigo Beetle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
