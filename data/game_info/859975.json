Going for the compo submission and finally making it for the first time! Didn't learn too much new with this entry, as I was feeling a bit out of touch with my gamedev. However I am happy with this simple game.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my Abbie, Dad, and Josie for play testing.<br/></p>\n<p>Dev ChangeLog</p>\n<p>Am aware of bug that prevents Restart Game, also that my build is a development build</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T09:28:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97d9def2100b8820c75fe052fb83ac91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["osh.studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
