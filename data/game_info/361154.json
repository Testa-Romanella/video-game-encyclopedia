The theme is \"only one.\"<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, players must complete each puzzle with\u00a0<strong>only one</strong> move! Complete as many puzzles as you can within <strong>only one</strong> minute!</p>\n<p>Quick Reference:</p>\n<ul><li>When activated, Arrows activate the tile in the direction they face and then rotate clockwise 90 degrees</li><li>When activated, Conduits activate the next tile in the same direction</li><li>When activated, Prisms activate the tile to their right (from the point of view of the activating tile)</li></ul>\n<p>I hope you enjoy, and post your high score! The highest I've gotten is 32 :)</p>\n\n<p>I wrote all the code, drew all the art, wrote all the music, and came up with the design on my own for this game.
