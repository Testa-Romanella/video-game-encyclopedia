I\u2019m assuming this is because I didn\u2019t look over the build settings and messed something up. As of now, the game is unplayable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cb841cdb9ccb3c126a637839efce012.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmeraldAlkemist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
