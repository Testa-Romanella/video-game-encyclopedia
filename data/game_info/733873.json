The 3 modifications that I made include adding Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus to the Solar system and scaling them to size. I also added their respective textures to make them appear as they would in real life, and made them rotate around themselves and revolve around the sun. This project was created by Jack Machesky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087b90d4b84e8615390a9eeecade778f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["machesk7"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
