You are Trooper, an average soldier in the middle of a place you'd rather not be. They're green and they're pissed, and you have no idea why.</p><p>Features 4 awe-inspiring bosses, and fast-paced action happening all around you in 360 degrees. Put on your headphones and Google Cardboard headset, and stand up to the fight (quite literally, see below).</p><p>Trooper 2c does not require additional controllers, and uses the magnetic trigger available on most Google Cardboard headsets.</p><p><strong>Programmer's note:</strong> Use the first 5 levels as warm-up for tougher levels. Tactical advice is to prioritize the closest green things first, and disperse mobs. Enjoy!</p><p><strong>Stand up! </strong>I highly recommend standing up and physically turning around to shoot. That'll also give you a significant skill advantage due to instinctive peripheral reflexes. Please be careful not to hit real-world things around you. 3D sound through headphones will add to the instinctive awareness.</p><p>[1] http://vrfocus.com/archives/12562/trooper-2-now-available-oculus-vr-share/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c2c1c2805333ce0d0f1ce6af38bd7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cmdr2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
