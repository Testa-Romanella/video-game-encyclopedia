You will have to explore the surroundings to find the four missing parts of your ship to leave.\u00a0<br/>For this, you will use oxygen relays which not only allow you to breathe but also to appropriate the terrain. If you have none left, look for sparkling green crystals: Sylvanite. With those crystals you can have new relays and advance further.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Survival advice</strong>: Don't stray too far away from the oxygen bubbles because in this peaceful world, your only enemy is asphyxiation.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br/>The tileset came from the game <strong>The Messenger </strong>by<strong> Sabotage Studio</strong>.<br/>The soundtrack is Forsaken Grotto from the game\u00a0<strong>Starbound </strong>by<strong> Chucklefish.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>I do\u00a0<strong>not</strong>\u00a0own nor claim to own the assets from\u00a0<em>The Messenger</em>, the soundrack from <em>Starbound\u00a0</em>or any copyrighted material here,\u00a0and will take this game down if any of the copyright owners request\u00a0that I do so.<br/><br/>If you're interested by <strong>The Messenger</strong>:\u00a0https://themessengergame.com/<br/>If you're interested by <strong>Starbound</strong>:\u00a0https://playstarbound.com/</p>\n\n\n<p>The team :\u00a0<br/>Game Designer : <strong>L\u00e9o Barbary :\u00a0https://krinassie.itch.io/</strong><br/>Level Designer :\u00a0<strong>Maxence Rerat :\u00a0https://kero-san.itch.io/\u00a0,<br/></strong>Animation :\u00a0<strong>Lalo Messine :\u00a0https://cailloudelariviere.itch.io/<br/></strong>Programmer : <strong>Matteo\u00a0Bonapersona\u00a0 :\u00a0https://masterofcookiez.itch.io/<br/></strong>Programmer - UI : <strong>Alexandre Mitranescu :\u00a0</strong><strong>https://org4nx.itch.io/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1df64a01438698bea7400e88b1d8247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kero-san"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
