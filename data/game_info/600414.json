I am working as a deckhand for Captain John Bramble.\r\n </p>\r\n19th July 1680: \r\n<p>We lost our first crewmate today, he was caught stealing from the ships  stores. Captain Bramble is a brutal man he cast him adrift in a jolly  boat.\r\n </p>\r\n4th August 1680: \r\n<p>Yet another example of the Captain\u2019s brutality, three men flogged for  not saluting a Midshipman.Perhaps these brutal acts come from his time  in the Navy fighting the Dutch?\r\n </p>\r\n21st August 1680: \r\n<p>Moral among the men has fallen, I am beginning to regret taking this journey to the Americas. There are mutterings of mutiny...\r\n </p>\r\n30th August 1680: \r\n<p>The Captain is dead, thrown overboard. A man named Kidd is now Captain. We are now heading for the Port of Kingston.\r\n </p>\r\n15th September 1680: \r\n<p>Land has been spotted, I need to get off this ship...\r\n </p>\n<p>You leap from the ship and starting swimming for a small island. You  drag yourself ashore, you\u2019ve lost your sword, gun and all your supplies. But at least you still have  your hat...Now it is time to find out where  you have washed ashore. <br/></p>\n\r\nLicense:\r\n<p>Monkey asset taken from: <br/></p>\n<p>http://Gameartguppy.com<br/></p>\r\nLegal:\r\n<p>Any art you download for FREE from this site is under a Creative Commons Attribution License.
