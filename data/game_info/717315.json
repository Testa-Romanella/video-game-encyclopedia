{"id": 717315, "slug": "deep-thoughts-2", "name": "Deep Thoughts", "name_original": "Deep Thoughts", "description": "<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>Deep Thoughts is playable to any number of players starting from two. Each player fills in their own game board based on the dice number thrown each round. The dice numbers are public knowledge and are usable by everyone unless the dice are rethrown by individual players using special skills. When the first player finishes its board, they are obliged to announce their completion and the game ends after the other players complete the round.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tie Breaker:</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If multiple players complete their boards in the same round, whoever finishes the green \u201cWhat\u201d area earliest in the game would be declared the winner.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Components:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Multiple Deep Thoughts game board, one per player.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>One six-sided dice with numbers each for the colors red, green, yellow, blue, and white.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Setup:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each player would receive a game board, and a Game Manager who serves as the dice thrower would have the five dice ready.\r\n</p>\n<p>When all the boxes in an area are filled, the player should fold the part of the game board over based on the dotted line printed. And the player would receive the corresponding skill the area provides, for limited times as signified. Each time a skill is used, the player should cross out the box to signify its use.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At the start of each round, the five dice would be thrown to reveal random numbers ranging from 1 to 6. The white dice serves as the \u201cwild card\u201d, its number could be used to fill in a box in any area of the player\u2019s choice.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Each player can use the number of the wild dice and the number of another single dice of their wish. With the exception of the white dice, each dice can only be used for boxes in their corresponding colored areas. For example, a player may choose a red dice to fill in a box in the red \u201cWho\u201d area. In addition to the white dice and the colored dice of their choice, the player may also freely employ any number of special skills they have available to them. The uses of special skills don\u2019t count as actions. For example, if the player has both the \u201cWho\u201d and \u201cWhat\u201d skills available to them, in addition to using the white dice and another chosen dice they may also duplicate a dice of their choice (\u201cWhat\u201d skill) and fill in a fourth blank with any number (\u201cWho\u201d skill) in a single round. The player may use as many skills they have available as they wish in a single round. And if new skills are gained during the round, they may be immediately applied.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Project management, game design, game board art By David Liao</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game board art by Siena Sockel</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Playtest &amp; game design by Kevin Long</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/95082f624fc3dfe7ff065fc6eef1779f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Liao", "ses880"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
