Humans have begun to expand into what was once peaceful woodlands, chopping down trees, filling in ponds, and redirecting rivers, all for the sake of industry. It is this destruction that has forced a small Community of woodland creatures to band together despite their differences so they may traverse the countryside and find themselves a new home, one that is safe from the dangers of man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <em><strong>Briar &amp; Bramble</strong></em>, players take on the role of these woodland creatures, valuable members of <strong>The Community</strong>. Together they will overcome obstacles such as:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Travelling between dangerous environments.\r\n</li><li>Negotiating between other animal Communities you encounter.\r\n</li><li>Avoiding humans.\r\n</li><li>Internal Community conflicts.\r\n</li><li>External predator threats like wolves, hawks, and snakes.\r\n</li><li>Keeping their Community together and safe.\r\n</li><li>Foraging for food.\r\n</li><li>Finding shelter.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Briar &amp; Bramble</strong> </em>is a game about <strong>Community </strong>and <strong>Survival</strong>. Only by working together can these wayward souls hope to find somewhere safe to call home, lest they fall victim to the cruelties of nature.</p>\n<p>The key thematic inspirations for <em><strong>Briar &amp; Bramble</strong></em> are darker tales of animals such as <em><strong>The Animals of Farthing Wood</strong></em> by Colin Dann and <em><strong>Watership Down</strong></em> by Richard Adams. The name was inspired by the song <em><strong>Detectorists</strong> </em>by Johnny Flynn.</p>\n<p>Games Design &amp; Writing by Freddie Taylor-Bell<br/>Cover Artwork by Anastasia Khmelevska<br/>Playbook handouts by Harald Eckm\u00fcller<br/>Editing by Steven Ticehurst<br/>Woodland Advice By Lefty</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05f/05f095532823d71ae8786955ad8148db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freddie Taylor-Bell"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
