Since the creators of Interstellar published their paper with the mathematics of how light traverses a wormhole, I adapted the equations and shaders to make an interactable, real-time rendering of a wormhole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fly through the wormhole smoothly transitioning from one side to the other, orbit around the wormhole, circle around the throat, change the length of the throat, and cycle through loads of skyboxes and grid projections to help you understand the inner mechanics of a wormhole!</p>\n<p>I have no idea what the minimum hardware requirements are, but a graphics card is required. A graphics card that specializes in raytracing is extremely beneficial. My RTX 3090 was able to maintain 4k 144fps and I've been able to run this on a GTX 1080 at lower framerates since it doesn't specialize in raytracing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bbb46f444b49db6907a69a5a54f6d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenderiteGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
