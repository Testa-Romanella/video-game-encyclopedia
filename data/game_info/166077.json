Do your best to avoid the swaths of enamored stallions to reach your house safely before your willpower is used up! </p><p>Use left and right to speed up and slow down, and up to jump, and be sure to collect floating powerups to regain some willpower!<br/></p><p>Thank you to ArtsofAllKinds for all his work in programming and developing the game! Enjoy!</p><p>Development Info:</p><p>-This is currently an early version of the game; although it's far from finished, this release is as far as my programming knowledge will allow me to work.</p><p>-Please be patient when changing screens! The game takes a few seconds to switch from menu to menu, and it may look like it's hanging, but it's working! Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SideKick"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
