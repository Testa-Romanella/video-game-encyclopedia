Walk off the platform at the start to begin falling.<br/><br/>there are some parts of mechanics in there, one of the sigils speeds you up if you have orbs, the other slows you down and disconnects and orb if you have any. Sorry they both look extremely similar.</p>\n<p>There is no end state or failstate, if you loose all your orbs you wont be able to boost anymore but you can still calmly fall till you grow tired.<br/></p><p>Can be played as a relaxing falling simulator/self hypnosis game<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game about falling through a long tunnel losing parts of yourself. Its very unfinished but hey if you want to fall forever you might enjoy it. This was\u00a0my first time using godot/3d, struggled with spatial transforms and the right way to move nodes around.</p>\n<p>This was made as a submission for ld48 compo.</p><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/$250104<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb3/bb3de9a6b49e1d5af6307bda4bd77752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sitonapanotis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
