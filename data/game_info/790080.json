Well, me neither. But anyway, now you can! As the operator of a so-called \"High\u00a0Tech State of the Art\" Z-tank you have order to make your way to the frontline \u2013\u00a0or at least not to lose your vehicle (which will happen eventually). Keep an eye on your fuel management and be aware of Ukrainian \"predators\" trying to seize your, well, not too valuable weapon.</p>\n<p>This is a charity project, you can either play the game for free or donate as much as you like. 90% of the net revenue\u00a0 (or even more if the game goes\u00a0 skyrocket) will go to charity for the support of Ukrainian refugees. 10% (or less if the game goes skyrocket) will flow into the development of our other game. For transparency reasons we will share the monthly\u00a0 charity bill on our discord channel.<br/><br/>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/GJATAbN7yT<br/></p>\n<p>The game is VR only, tested with Oculus/Meta Quest 1/2 and Rift.<br/>No guarantee the game will work on other headsets.</p>\n<p>This game is the result of a personal \"A Game in a Week\" challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T07:57:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86fb7084c91510452ce433f446144c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnCheers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
