You're not alone, and that's why we are rewriting it for those who are disappointed with how the story and events are turning out.<br/><br/>Loosely following the storyline in the beginning but quickly diverging from there, this rewrite features fleshed out characters, a fully customizable MC, and an intimacy level system that allows you to become closer with your favorite characters to befriend or romance them.<br/><br/>Tons of original content await you, along with various storylines and eventual \"routes\" for the love interests\u00a0impacted by every one of your choices. You are able to customize your name, pronouns, personality, appearance, and much more to make this a completely personalized experience for you. So, come journey once more to the Devildom - you won't regret it!<br/><br/>[All characters belong to NTT Solmare except Seraphina.]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:06:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df765bf281f6b0af0158a37a49ea3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aceofcolours"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
