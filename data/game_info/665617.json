I picked Coin Block Bash, and by 'picked' I\u00a0mean it was the last one available as I was late to the ... party LOL.\u00a0\n<p>As Construct 3 is limited in the 3D realm I had to remake it in 2D which was a really fun challenge.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>It's a 1 v 3 mini game.\u00a0Play single player and control the hammer, hit blocks and other players to collect coins. Play 2 player mode and player 1 controls the hammer and player 2 joins the group of 3 with 2 AI players. When the timer runs out the team with the most coins wins.
