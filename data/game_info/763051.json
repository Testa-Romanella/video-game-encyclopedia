Help Fillo designate an area where he can spend his time with his love. In a mission through 15 levels, you must collect all the ice diamonds and trick the enemy penguins that take back the area you have already occupied. Time is also your enemy, you have a total of 20 seconds on each level to finish it. Good luck!</p>\n<p>The game was inspired by the graphics of plenty of other games. These are all Commodore16 games like: Major Blink, Petch, Boulder Dash, Harvey Headbanger.
