This fractal complexity gives each map a breathtaking sense of geographic realism.<br/><br/>Other open world games allow you to explore without limit in 2 dimensions: north-south and east-west. Coast of Kobe removes a completely different limit; by giving each tile a fractal dimension, you can now explore a world of complexity within each tile.\u00a0<br/><br/>Each tile contains worlds within worlds, dreams within dreams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffa09b0e60c00f479a70d030c6ea230c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["coastofkobe"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
