The Dog's Escaped!!\" is a 2D platformer I've created as a way to get back into games programming. Guide the player through 25 levels, spanning 5 worlds (Summer, Desert, Winter, Castle and Factory) in an effort to rescue your missing pooch. The game was designed with only three controls (left, right and jump) to make the game simple to play on both keyboard and touch screen. Its a full HD, 60FPS game and while simple to get into, takes a bit of practice to master!</p>\n<p>I've decided to make this a 'pay what you like' release as its my first proper game in forever! So please, check it out and if you feel this is worthy of some of your hard earned cash, consider popping over to www.preferredimage.co.uk to donate using the paypal button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3e46a48e2af963cc19a35a1cd53366.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prefim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
