What's that?\r\n<p>Glad you asked! <strong>RedBidd: A Colorful Revival</strong> is a complete remake of the original \"<strong>RedBidd: A Squared Madness</strong>\" made by swackyGCF in GameMaker: Studio. The entire game has been made in the span of a month. Many bugs have been encountered and different mechanics have been introduced throughout the development. And now the game is ready to enter a playable state.</p>\r\n\u00a0So what's the game about?\r\n<p>You play as RedBidd, a red rabbit who enjoys spending time with his friend Wraps playing video games. But uh-oh! A lighting beam has struck the land and made it lose all color. Now it's RedBidd's mission to find out what's going on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features this game has (that are present in pretty much any other game):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gamepad support!</li><li>Lovable characters (Who doesn't love TipBox?\u00a0\u00a0)</li><li>Dangerous obstacles!</li><li>And a full-fledged boss battle! (I wonder who we fight against?)</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nReminder that this is a demo version.\r\nThat means you may encounter some glitches here and there.\r\nIf you found some, please tell me in the comments!\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0https://mint-water.itch.io/\u00a0for providing a high quality logo you see on the thumbnail</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc39ffe4d9ff4ddf74da60851ff8e2ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swackyGCF"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
