My prompt was \"A short-and-sweet mashup of the bullet hell and puzzle game genres in which you need to collect colours\".</p>\n<p>What I settled on is a galaga-esque space shooter with a sketchy art style, where you must kill enemies to collect color orbs that you mix together to form a given color. You get one point each time you do this during the 4 1/2 minute level. Yes, there is a boss at the end. Taking damage from black orbs reduces your color.\u00a0Your collection of orbs is also your health, so if your ship goes completely dark: YOU LOSE!</p>\n<p>I streamed 90% of the process of making this game, which you can check out here:\u00a0https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9kbykhF6FZ__Sj-d3rnrNgx39t9Y_JYy</p>\n<p>This was my first ever full Unity project, so I apologize for the fact that you can't change the resolution... so you're stuck with 1920x1080 until I learn how to fix that. What do you want from me? I had limited time :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:00:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/6454b11cb84c70d0310c01e5d317c8ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake Barnes"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
