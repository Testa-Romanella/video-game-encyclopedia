God Save the King.\" \u2013 This was the message sent by the British forces in the final hours of the struggle for Arnhem Bridge.

Its design is based on the critically acclaimed Close Combat \u2013 A Bridge Too Far, originally developed by Atomic Games, as well as the more recent Close Combat: The Longest Day. This is the most ambitious and most improved of the new Close Combat releases.<br/><br/>As the Allies, you will carry out the world\u2019s largest airborne operation, Operation Market Garden, to cross the Rhine and bring a swift end to the war or, as the Germans, use a hastily organized set of defense forces to prevent the Allies from reaching their ultimate goal, Arnhem Bridge. Close Combat \u2013 Last Stand Arnhem comes with expanded force pools, reserve &amp; static battlegroups, a troop point buying system, ferry and assault crossings, destructible bridges, static forces and much more!
