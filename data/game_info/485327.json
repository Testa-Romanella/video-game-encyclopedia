Tiles will randomly turn red. Red tiles will kill the player on contact. A brief indication is given when a tile is about to turn red. The tiles are safe to move on as soon as they return to their default color. Each time you complete a level, more tiles will turn red at the same time for increasing difficulty. Use the wasd or arrow keys to move. Each maze is procedurally generated for a new challenge each time you play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T03:00:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1fa8b36c4c5d56f9b14f734edcc0256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pyroburger"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
