The main tasks are set by the customer, but what methods to achieve them - you can decide for yourself!<br/><br/>Each completed task will bring you a certain amount of money, for which in the next order it will be possible to do something that would not have been enough initially. For example, hang a new chandelier, and not just screw in a light bulb.<br/><br/>You, as a worker, are not limited by anything: you can simply make cosmetic repairs, or you can break some walls and build new ones where you see fit.<h3>List of your best friends for lead time:</h3>- Roller, for painting any surfaces<br/>- Hammer, to create the passages you need<br/>- Mop and hose, to remove unclean deeds of customers<br/>- Tablet, to buy any object from any part of the world<br/>- Lawn mower to mow the dense thickets of some customers<br/>- Spatula and bricks to create new partitions<br/>- A shovel to clean up age-old landfills<br/>- As well as your hands and head to carry objects and choose the best ways to solve the tasks<br/><br/>And now it's time to finally establish your team, from one person!
