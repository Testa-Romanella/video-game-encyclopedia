{"id": 743893, "slug": "tutankham-c64", "name": "Tutankham (C64)", "name_original": "Tutankham (C64)", "description": "<p>This game\u00a0for Commodore 64 is the port of Tutankham, an arcade game developed by Konami in 1982.</p>\n<p>The game works perfectly on both PAL and NTSC models. However, for game speeds similar to the original arcade game, it is\u00a0suggested using an NTSC model.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Overview<br/></strong>In this game, the player controls an\u00a0explorer who is robbing Tutankhamun's\u00a0tomb. The player will search for\u00a0precious treasures (maps, lamps, chests\u00a0of gold &amp; jewels, and, above all, the\u00a0golden mask of King Tut) and fight off\u00a0the various creatures that guard the\u00a0tomb to ultimately find the way through\u00a0the catacombs.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong>The player must guide the explorer\u00a0through a series of progressively more\u00a0difficult mazes across different stages. The explorer may move in four\u00a0directions, but can only fire in two\u00a0directions, left and right, making the\u00a0player helpless in vertical shafts. There are also \"warp zones\" located in\u00a0random parts of each maze that allow the\u00a0explorer to be teleported from one area\u00a0of the maze to another. There are\u00a0several different creatures that\u00a0constantly materialize from \"spawning\u00a0zones\" within the maze and attack,\u00a0including crows, snakes, bats, dragons,\u00a0and other magical beings. Those\u00a0creatures can be destroyed to score\u00a0between 20 and 60 points with either\u00a0bullets or a \"flash bomb\". The explorer\u00a0has a single \"flash bomb\" per life\u00a0that destroys all enemies on the\u00a0screen. On each stage, the explorer must\u00a0pick up keys in order to unlock the door\u00a0to the room where each of the treasures\u00a0are kept, allowing the passage to the\u00a0next stage. Along the way, the explorer\u00a0may grab optional treasures (rings and\u00a0coffers) for bonus points. If the timer\u00a0reaches zero, the player's ability to\u00a0fire is removed. Bonus points are\u00a0awarded based on the amount of extra\u00a0time left over when a stage is\u00a0completed. After the player has\u00a0recovered the King Tut's treasures in\u00a0all the stages, the game starts over\u00a0again with increased difficulty and more\u00a0keys to pick up.</p>\n<p>At 30000 points the player earns an extra life.</p>\n<p><strong>Options<br/></strong>There are 4 difficulty levels to choose from: Novice, Medium, Hard, Expert.\u00a0The Hard level roughly corresponds to the Easy level of the original arcade game, while the Expert level corresponds to the Normal arcade level.</p>\n<p>There are also 2 fire modes:<br/>A) When you press fire, the left and right bullets are fired simultaneously<br/>B) To fire the bullet on the left, press fire and move the joystick lever to the left (the explorer does not change direction). To shoot right, press fire and move the lever to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Joystick lever: move the explorer<br/>Fire button: shoot<br/>Spacebar: detonate the flash bomb</p>\n<p>While playing, press F7 to pause or F1\u00a0to stop the game and go back to the\u00a0title.</p>\n<p>While the best scores are showing,\u00a0press F1 to reset the ranking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d57/d5798f70f4be3c9652d50c1a8e187583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LC-Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
