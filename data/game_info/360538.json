He was also separated from his tea set for a period of time, which is a terrible tragedy. As it is commonly known,\u00a0 the British cannot exist in our reality without a tea for too long, and so Sir Reginald soon lost his ability to travel in more than one dimension. Please, guide our beloved Sir Reginald safely to his tea.</p>\n<p>P.S.
