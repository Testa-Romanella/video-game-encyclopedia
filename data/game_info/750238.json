{"id": 750238, "slug": "press-w-to-move-forward", "name": "Press W To Move Forward", "name_original": "Press W To Move Forward", "description": "<p>Press W to Move Forward is a 5-minute experimental horror game exploring the rhetorics of progress, control, and societal pressure. Like the title suggests, the player's only mode of control is through pressing W to progress the game with occasional mouse movements.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on the horror of modern life under surveillance, with repetition, and no apparent way of moving forward. Each of us ultimately gets consumed by this grim realism and becomes what we feared the most, and the cycle repeats. Each of us is given a false sense of control to escape, we are told that we could manage where ever our life is heading, but that is nothing more than a video game trope of pressing W to make your life move forward. All of us are\u00a0on the same path towards the same\u00a0death drive, of the nameless other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91fca9adec2152e1509dc4b76d93d9ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nil Knight"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
