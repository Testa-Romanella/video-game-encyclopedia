The point is to obtain a high score, but they are not saved in any way by the game. You can walk through blocks, and they only stop you from falling. You can pass through blocks by holding down and pressing jump.</p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>ProgramGamer: Programming</li><li>Jessica: Art and UI</li><li>Michael: Music and SFX</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78ef7fe62a11dee7793f62d220d8e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProgramGamer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
