I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re closed in this wing due to a horrific invasion by some random alien hippies talking about how we shouldn\u2019t desolate and mine their whole planet. Now it is your job as a peacekeeping robot to kill them and we can pretend this never happened. Fail and all our research will be destroyed, we will all die and you will be a very sad robot. Also please try and fix any rogue bots hacked by the aliens, your preferred method should be to smash them. Use your abilities to your advantage as we try to clean up the bugs in your UI, namely the fact that just by being alive you lose energy constantly. Lose all your energy and die horribly. We were able to insert a kinetic energy punching attack which allows you to hit other robots in order to drain their energy, after you charge it up by landing shots with your coil gun, provided your AI doesn\u2019t fail you and you miss as that will drain some stored kinetic energy.  We will do our best to try and power up some chargers in certain rooms, so try and find them when we tell you. Move with your legs and don\u2019t die, now go and save us!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea41b59ebce5ffae492ac74cb11a3f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Llamaware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
