Only a few light sources like candles, magic staffs and torches illuminate the area, which turns every corner into a pitch-black spot of uncertainty with potential loot to grab for those who dare to explore. Equipped with just a torch, the player must find as much gold as possible while avoiding the light to not get seen and still maneuver through the darkness safely. Use your surroundings and listen closely to spot potential secrets or stealthy enemies hiding where you won\u2019t expect it!</p>\n\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<p><strong>Movement</strong> - WASD</p>\n<p><strong>Camera</strong> - Mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Sprint</strong> - Shift</p>\n<p><strong>Crouch</strong> - Ctrl</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong> - Space</p>\n<p><strong>Torch</strong> - E</p>\n<p><strong>Interact</strong> - LMB</p>\n\r\nGamepad Controls\r\n<p><strong>Movement</strong>\u00a0- Left stick</p>\n<p><strong>Camera</strong>\u00a0- Right stick</p>\n<p><strong>Sprint</strong>\u00a0- Left or right trigger</p>\n<p><strong>Crouch</strong>\u00a0- L3</p>\n<p><strong>Jump</strong>\u00a0- A</p>\n<p><strong>Torch</strong>\u00a0- B</p>\n<p><strong>Interact</strong>\u00a0- X</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made for an university assignment covering interaction methods and devices by:</p>\n<ul><li>The Fifth King / Discord: The Fifth\u00a0King#0005 / Lead programming, game and level design, and voice acting\r\n</li><li>SpyPlayer / Discord: Marvin#4012 / Programming</li><li>UsefulCompanion / Discord: UsefulCompanion#7607 / UI Art</li><li>Satsujin / Discord: satsujin#6043 / Level design</li><li>Teodrus / Discord: Teodrus#7064 / Character interactions</li><li>Ryanocerou5 / Discord:\u00a0Ryanocerou5#3266\u00a0/ Music and Sound<br/>\n</li><li>Eevee / Discord:\u00a0\u0f3aEevee\u0f3b#8737 / Voice acting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T10:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e73/e73bd4086e13652973a395aee404e4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fifth King"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
