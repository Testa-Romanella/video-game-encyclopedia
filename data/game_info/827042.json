Going through various topics and meeting other people, or sometimes no one even connects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Listening to the radio a song comes on and prompts another topic in your mind, \"<em>80's rock</em>\". Curious, you type it in as your next topic.</p>\n<p>Little did you know this would be your strangest encounter yet.</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong><strong> meet\u00a0Donnoroch</strong>. A demon curious about humans, but has never met one himself.\u00a0Answer his questions and choose how you want to\u00a0<strong>&gt;</strong><em>respond</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nFeaturing:\r\n<p><strong>&gt;</strong>\u00a0 990 words\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>&gt;</strong>\u00a0 4 endings\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>&gt;</strong>\u00a0 2 unlockable main menu images\r\n</p>\n\n<p>I made this game for the O2A2VN Jam (2022), and had fun doing so!</p>\n<p>This is my first published Visual Novel, albeit short but I\u00a0guess that's the nature of the jam after all.</p>\n<p>I may pick up this concept and extend on it more if there's enough interest as this did feel more like a proof-of-concept rather than a full game. But I did try my best to at least make the game feel like it can work standalone as-is.</p>\n<p>But yeah, enjoy!! I sure enjoyed making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T08:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e354250d0eb13f9bb087f63512aab3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["pann"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
