That plan fails, so everyone starts arguing \"who's fault is it?\"</p>\n\n<p>The camel that you're in control of happens to understand human languange. But an animal is an animal, so it cannot use words to communicate. This leaves you with 2 options to respond to every situation: Yes or No.</p>\n\n<p>Will you solve the conflict? Or will you mess with them? There's multiple endings, and a normal run should take around &lt;30 minutes!</p>\n\n<p>This game has been made by GameDevSeal!\u00a0 You can come check out my process of making this game on youtube!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7b/f7b454925742a4690c372c342ff745b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GameDevSeal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
