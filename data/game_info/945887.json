Please execute caution if you are photosensitive.</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p><em>Decades before you were born a disaster that wiped out 86% of  humanity occurred. The current generations no longer remember or know  what happened, and very few of the Oldest are still alive to recall the  events. Governments have largely collapsed, money no longer has value,  energy and transport are solar-powered, and people live by either  farming or raiding old abandoned storehouses, shops, etc. Some people  have moved into factories and are trying to recreate Old Things as a  hobby (like certain processed foods, clothes, toys, fireworks, etc.).  All knowledge of the Old World that existed digitally and in books was  preserved, so you can even have things such as computers - but you need  to find working electrical outlets, and very few places hold a satellite  internet connection\u2026 but you can definitely play an offline video game  if you find one!\u00a0 \r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>Life is largely peaceful.     </em></p>\n<p><em>Until...\r\n    </em></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cProve to me that humanity deserves preservation - or choose annihilation right here and now.\u201d\r\n<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>---</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is a 1 player+ GM-less journaling game in which you will  document your journey and impressions in order to plead humanity's case  before the Apocalypse Eternal. You will most likely fail, but success  isn't impossible.\u00a0\r\n    <br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay of <strong>\u2018We have two weeks to convince Apocalypse\u2019 </strong>is based on\u00a0The Wretched, product of Chris Bissette and Loot The Room.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Many thanks to somewherewithstories for the invaluable help they gave me with this game!
