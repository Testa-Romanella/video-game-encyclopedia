A shame she is barely on her senses and completely forgot how to fly or use magic spells. But she has a plan. Just spin and crash against the fairies at full speed!<br/><br/>Hold your finger against the screen to start spinning and release to dash. It's that simple!<br/>Just remember to dodge all the danmaku on the way.<br/><br/>Try and help Marisa fight the fairies for as long as possible before she gets kicked off her broom and into sobriety.<br/><br/>The game features 2 game modes:<br/><br/>-Arcade Mode-<br/>The main game mode. Spin, dash, fight fairies and dodge danmaku for as long as you can.<br/><br/>-Zen Mode-<br/>An unlockable sandbox for you to spin and bounce around with some toys.<br/><br/>This is my first ever mobile game. Thank you so much for downloading!<br/><br/>Please, enjoy this Casual Danmaku experience!</p>\n<p>(There was supposed to be an HTML5 version buuuuuuuuuuuuuut shit just aint working for some reason lmao.
