We met last year in October 2019 while we were at the <strong>Goethe Institute</strong> in <strong>Salvador </strong>da Bahia in <strong>Brazil </strong>for two months. We were looking for people to do collaborations with and got to know Nikima, an artist and musician from S\u00e3o Paulo.<br/></p>\n<p>He was working on an <strong>elaborate sci-fi</strong> story about humans rioting against a huge corporation called Auss &amp; Auss. The story was released in hyper-short chapters accompanied by Nikima's driving music. You can read them here.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspired by this story</strong> and a chapter about the hero digitizing himself to get away from the Auss &amp; Auss brothers' grasp, we created the game GRIOT RIOT. It was part of the Auss &amp; Auss exhibition in Salvador in 2020.<br/></p>\n<p>The original game is <strong>played with a real berimbau</strong> - a musical instrument traditionally used in <strong>Capoeira </strong>for rhythm. So in each level  you can find a different element the berimbau is made of.</p>\n<p>This version is playable with a keyboard (space bar), a game pad or any type of microphone input (see the readme.txt).<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb05b9bcbdfdec7f14a8b6b4523f9178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rat King"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
