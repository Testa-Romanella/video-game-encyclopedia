{"id": 283904, "slug": "crutch-chaos-026", "name": "Crutch Chaos 0.26", "name_original": "Crutch Chaos 0.26", "description": "<p>Crutch Chaos is an action sidescroller featuring simple gameplay, a bold visual style that's a little bit minimalist and a little bit retro, and a bit of a twist-- you've broken your leg, and that's just the start of your troubles.  The art style and gameplay will be different on release but have a similar feel and still be easy to pick up.</p><p>Since this was first uploaded, it's been updated to have a lower volume and less piercing music. My apologies to anyone bothered by the sound. A volume control is coming in the next demo.<br/></p>\n<p>Changes from the last demo include:</p>\n<ul><li>New animated player art</li><li>Background music and sound effects</li><li>Game save capability (only saves powerup status for now)</li><li>New powerup (mega health)</li><li>Tweaked movement</li><li>Improvements to controls</li></ul>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Going to full screen makes the game hang for a bit-- it sorts itself out after 5-6 seconds</li><li>If you get hit while going through a doorway, your next jump may be too high fixed</li></ul>\n<p>You can choose to walk past stairs or get on them. To get on stairs, use the up or down arrow when at the bottom or top of the stairs.</p>\n<p>Saving the game saves your current powerup status, which will be reapplied if you quit and restart the game.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Currently I'm mostly looking for feedback on gameplay mechanics, audio, and controls, but feedback on the visuals is also appreciated, as are bug reports.   Please be specific about any problem you have, whether it's a bug or not.</p>\n<p>If you want to help this game look better, please contact me (preferably via comments the first time). I'm willing to pay fair prices  for art.</p>\n<p>Controls can be changed to virtually anything. Standard keyboards and Xbox-compatible controllers are supported. Button and key names may differ based on your hardware (this will be worked on in future releases).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Default keyboard controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow keys</li><li>Attack - C</li><li>Jump - X</li><li>Climb ledge - Up arrow</li><li>Get on stairs - Up arrow/down arrow</li><li>Enter door - Up arrow</li><li>Pause - Escape</li><li>Accept setting - Enter</li><li>Back out of menu - Backspace</li><li>Guaranteed pause - Pause key (not rebindable)</li><li>Guaranteed quit - Alt-Q (not rebindable)</li><li>Full screen (toggle) - Alt-Enter (not rebindable currently)</li><li>Debug mode - Tilde (while at the main pause menu) (not rebindable)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Default controller controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - D-pad/left analog stick</li><li>Attack - X</li><li>Jump - A</li><li>Climb ledge - B</li><li>Get on stairs - Up/down on d-pad/analog stick</li><li>Enter door - Up on d-pad</li><li>Pause - Start/Menu button</li><li>Accept setting - A</li><li>Back out of menu - B</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c52637ca9eb05346a65b59a0f4472a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["General Vagueness"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
