I set up much interesting information in the game, and also give them 3 choices to choose their ending. There is one hidden ending, players have to pay attention to the text, and be patient as well. I can't say too many, please explore by yourselves. Enjoy it and thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc01b9dc40bc29d6652886fa6e6e6fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yukaisland"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
