He has no particular ambitions in life and keeps his head above water as a photographer of photo books of questionable quality. But when he is plagued by nightmares, he starts to investigate. And a letter addressed to him, but with the wrong surname, changes his life completely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The blood of a time-honored family of Shadowhunters beats in his heart. And with it comes a responsibility to his fellow man. For the Shadowhunters are destined to fight demonic beings, so-called 'shadows'. One such monster is currently killing in Vienna and has already claimed countless victims. Will Markus be up to the task?<br/><br/><br/><br/>But not only the supernatural plagues our young Shadowhunter. His publisher has big plans for a book that Markus himself hasn't even written. Will his presence in the public eye be advantageous, or will it hinder his existence as a Shadowhunter?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then there's also his love life, which takes off at a most inconvenient time. There's Claudia, the secretary, but also Ludwig, the charismatic digital designer.<br/><br/>And then there's Ro. A young woman who suddenly appears everywhere the shadow is.
