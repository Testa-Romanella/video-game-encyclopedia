With Z X C buttons being the rest. You use the amulet with C button but I\u00a0think you can figure it out the rest, some of the fun lies there.\u00a0Theres just one basic secret but there will be a lot more in the final game\u00a0so\u00a0have fun. And controller support is coming, it's just that I\u00a0need a decent one.</p>\n\n<p>It is still at the Alpha testing stage and missing most sound effects, some theme music etc; but\u00a0I'm very proud of it so far.</p>\n<p>I hope that you'll like it and share it with your friends.<br/>And maybe you can give me feedback on issues or what you like/dislike about it.</p>\n<p>I plan to publish it for PC/Mac as soon as I can.
