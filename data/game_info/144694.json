This might lead you to questions like - is that an egg carton in the background? Did that used to be a box full of soda cans? It's all possible - we chose our cardboard indiscriminately, from the back of a taqueria late at night.</p>\n<p>Style of Play -- Karlbord is a 2D side-scrolling game ala old-school Mario games. The objective is simple - collect the coins, get as far as you can in the level. The catch? The levels are incomplete! Only with the help of your Ethereal Pal (Player #2) - who can place blocks for you to build the level in real-time - can you keep going. How far can you go? Score comes from how far you've made it + points from coins collected.</p>\n\n<p>Originally made in 48 hours with \u2764 &amp; very little sleep in San Jose, California</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Dani Casadevall Pino - code<br/>Daniel Chamberlin - tech art, animation, cardboard procurement<br/>Dave Heefner - production, teamwork<br/>Scott Looze - code<br/>Chris Seguritan - art, cardboard art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/97999a7d4346ee352f03bd1ef98aeea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yamslayer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
