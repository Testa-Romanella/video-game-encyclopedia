Be warned, Fire is hot! It also doesn\u2019t last long.</li>\n</ul>\r\nVitalities\r\n<p>The human body is vital, and therefore must be kept in tip-top shape. There are three vitalities to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Heat</li>\n<li>Thirst</li>\n<li>Hunger</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your temperature in check. The ideal value is 34\u00b0C. Fall too low, or too high and you will meet your timely demise (namely &lt;24\u00b0C, and &gt;50\u00b0C). Keep a flint or two in your pocket for a portable heat-source where needed.</li>\n<li>Your body must stay hydrated. Craft empty cups and fill them with water at the river to regain lost hydration. Be warned, however, as drinking cups of cool river water will lower your body temperature.</li>\n<li>In this cruel forest, hunger can\u2019t be gained; it can only be lost. Escape before you starve, or you\u2019ll probably die or something, idk.</li>\n</ul>\r\nTips\r\n<ul>\n<li>Always keep a flint on the ready; same goes for a cup of water.</li>\n<li>Try to remember where spawn is, it\u2019s the only zone with naturally-recurring pebbles.</li>\n<li>Twigs only spawn near the tops of trees and blend in quite well with the ground.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t Freeze.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do die, however, there is a continue button. There are no consequences other than you having to live with the guilt of dying in perhaps the easiest game on the planet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d96f41fe3763d608e0c565b6b834b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neonalig"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
