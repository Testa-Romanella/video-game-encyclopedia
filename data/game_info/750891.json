Permadi<br/><br/>The initial version managed about 1 frame per second - with a few optimisations, including a little asm, it's now up to about 15-20fps in VisualBoyAdvance.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It runs fine on real hardware too, but a little more slowly. It's a fairly straightforward implementation of the basic techniques presented in the tutorial, with fixed-point math and table-based trig functions giving it speed, as well as the odd bit of assembler.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This homebrew includes an sprite system for drawing in-game objects, and some floor and ceiling textures textures. This homebrew also added shading to give the graphics a bit more depth.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>- In the menu use the directional pad to select the dungeon and press the A button to enter it.<br/>- In the menu press the START button to get additional information about this homebrew for GBA.<br/>- Once inside a dungeon use the direction pad to move around the map.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T05:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c37/c37434fefc5186ca977db0635f3ea419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ry0G4"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
