Ward, who you will follow during the game, bored of his everyday life, moved to the city as soon as he could to hopefully sate his wanderlust, but his new life in Taro proved to be annoyingly uneventful.</p>\n\n<p>Things are about to change however, as when his sister mysteriously dissapears, he needs to take care of his nephew - Alek, who seems to keep as many mysteries as the city itself. At the same time - the elusive leader of the Feleks - Forrox visits the city and is sharing a common interest in its past with Ward, whom he hires as a local guide. To add to this, at the same time the young felek starts having rather unusual visions, which feel much more real than a daydream... Guiding him on his adventure the player will need to solve mysteries intertwined into the world of Taro, meet and talk to it's inhabitants, as well as, when given no other choice, prove his strenght and reflexes in battles - big and small. The city however, does not offer just a challenge. It is a charming place full of interesting things, with beautiful views, remote and diverse locations - perfect places for relaxation and reflection. All this accompanied by a soundtrack composed and performed by Felocai.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This demonstrative version of \"Ghost of Fall\" lets you get acquainted with some gameplay mechanics that the game has to offer, as well as get to know the main character - Ward. The demo can also be described as a \"Chapter zero\" of the main story, as it takes place just before the main game begins.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>We encourage you to join our official discord server if you are interested in the game! </em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Everybody is free to join.
