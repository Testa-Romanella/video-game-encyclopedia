The game was developed as a personal 'game jam' project in under 72 hours, so it's still buggy and in early development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please leave a comment below after trying it out, and I look forward to your suggestions!</p>\n<p><em>Gameplay:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Player1 movement:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A &amp; D - move left &amp; right</li><li>Space - Strike</li><li>S - Stance(movement cancellation)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Player2 movement:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Left &amp; Right - move left &amp; right</li><li>Arrow Up - Strike</li><li>Arrow Down - Stance(movement cancellation)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile users:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left &amp; Right button - move left &amp; right</li><li>\u9762 button - Strike</li><li>\u4e2d button - Stance(movement cancellation)</li></ul>\n<p><em>Mechanic:</em></p>\n<p>The gameplay is hugely influenced by the famous martial art - Kendo. Therefore the mechanics are designed based on it:</p>\n<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Players aim to hit each other's heads to score a point; <strong>The first person who gets\u00a0two points will win.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Strike</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The distance is the key; players can use the swords to measure how far they can attack.\u00a0<em>\u00a0</em><strong>Pressing SPACE/Arrow Up/\u9762 will perform a basic attack</strong>, which will push the character a little bit forward and then strike. Although this will make the character strike a bit further, it is slow. Alternatively,\u00a0\u00a0<strong>holding down S/Arrow Down/\u4e2d + SPACE/Arrow Up/\u9762 will strike faster</strong> but\u00a0at a shorter distance.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Stance</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Stance is an important mechanic in the game. After each attack, the character will run forward to ensure the opponent doesn't get any chance to strike back.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>To cancel this movement, press S/Arrow Down/\u4e2d.\u00a0\u00a0</strong><strong>Stance can also disable the opponent's strike when pressed at the moment they strike.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Follow for more:</p>\n<p>Instagram: @rylan_lii<br/>Website: https://rylanlidesign.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T13:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33c605c8b0f75aaa6bd932f9267015ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RylanLi"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
