The game may not be balanced very well. There is no guarantee this game will ever enter full production or be finished.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Welcome to NOBA! The weird Moba-like where you control an entire team all alone! Oh no! I wanted to try to make a game where the player has to control a bunch of units, and make that both tricky and not overly complicated to do. This is the result. I think it is pretty sweet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Most art assets are from a free asset pack by Kenney.
