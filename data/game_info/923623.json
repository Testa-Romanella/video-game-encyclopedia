It's fascinating how life can emerge from simple rules that the particles must follow. Here, cells can die, grow, feed and live. This is my 9th bio-inspired simulation. Unfortunately compute shaders in WebGL are yet not supported by any computer graphics APIs, maybe in the furute I'll redo this in WebGPU.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For now only Windows version is available but if\u00a0 anyone wants a version for Linux or Mac I can add them too.\r\n</p>\n<p>Made as a part of an assignment from @Arsiliath course to write compute shaders in Unity. Check him and his course out\u00a0here.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T08:46:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d8381d46f120e5d00db3948ab619ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gubebra"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
