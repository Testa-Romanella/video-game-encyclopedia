Instead of fighting the pollution, the goal is to use the strategies that were employed since the 1960s: diverting attention and leveraging your lobbyists to influence law-making in favour of your company. </p>\n<p>Based on idle game mechanics, the player places factories that produce money and parts. The parts are used to build new factories and upgrade existing ones. The money can be spent on marketing and ad campaigns that remove protests or used for lobbyists, who then prevent laws from being passed that would shut down your factories.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T11:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bc8e8e88de0907fafb6fc041c1eccf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["MarloGameDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
