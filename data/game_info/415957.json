CPU's operate in cycles, hence the 'clock'. In the game, you can only execute the instructions for your little toon when the clock is over your colour - somehow tying back to a clock? Loose I know, but I\u00a0wanted to opt for something that wasn't music or sound related, which were the first things that came to mind when thinking of frequencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to the following community members:</p>\n<ul><li>Tesselode (Roomy, Cartographer)</li><li>Ulydev (Shack)</li><li>\u00a0rxi (Flux)</li><li>Kikito (Bump)\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>for the use of their libraries.
