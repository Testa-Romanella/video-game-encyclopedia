That means towers powered by that pylon will no longer work!</p>\n<p>So plan wisely and don't let the enemies come to far, or otherwise you'll quickly be <strong>running out of space</strong>.</p><p><strong>How to play</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>Click on a powered building slot to build a tower. Available towers are:</p><ul><li>Gun Turret (50$)</li><li>Advanced Gun Turret (50$)</li><li>Rocket Turret (75$)</li><li>Advanced Rocket Turret (75$)</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: This game is likely far from balanced. Balancing strategy games is always a process that required a lot of time and testing.</p><p>There also are only 4 waves and no end-screen for now. So when the game says you're in wave 5 and there are no more enemies left, you're done!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1b671ca02764d73ca66026328ba5f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0xDiddi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
