Made to add to my portfolio.\u00a0</p><p>Prototype story -</p><p>In a world where people are not allowed to leave their homes VR has become the only means of escape for people. A new game called A Cool NEW VR Game has just released, where players are able to simulate parkour through Virtual reality headsets. Unfortunately, you are playing the game on a crappy pc with an old laptop i5 and integrated \u2018HD\u2019 Graphics and a measly 4Gb of RAM. This means that the does not have enough horsepower to run the simulation. Memory leaks, graphical bugs and a host of other \u2018features\u2019 are out to break the game and kill you. If you get a high enough score you may unlock a secret screen that alludes to a larger story. In the finished game, there will be hidden messages from the developers about the wider scope of why the game was created. In an expanded game you uncover rooms the \u2018developers\u2019 wouldn\u2019t allow you to see.\r\n</p><p>The Objective of the game is to run through the game as fast as possible and get each of the collectibles. If you collect each of the collectibles and get under a time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds, a message appears.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p><p>Made using Unreal 4\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T05:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a20/a2041130b6bfcd8dba9a65ac705cb80c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamieLambDesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
