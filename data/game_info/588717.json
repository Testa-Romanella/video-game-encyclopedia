There are 24 events. So, a win for myself.</p>\n<p>In this case, if you eat the sweet snacks you will eventually die.</p>\n<p>I made this game in 4 hours because I did join the game until there was only 1 day and 6 hours left and the next day was not available for game dev. Thus I did what I could with the small amount of time I had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is meant to be funny and lighthearted. Please have a sense of humor with the character death sequence.</p>\n<p>I used Construct 3, Beepbox, and My mouth to make the assets in this game.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun. Eat cake!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:31:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3bac038b2279a97a337e3b03bc2ba3c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
