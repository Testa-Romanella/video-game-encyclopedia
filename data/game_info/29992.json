You and your tribe have to compete with up to three others to find the Moonstone and bring it back to the Stone Circle. The prize is ultimate power!<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds simple enough if it wasn't for the small matter of the Black Knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have other ideas. Their masters have sworn them to destroy the Moonstone - and you with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a whole gang of extremely nasty friends to help them. These include hammer-wielding Trogs, vicious Ratmen, Mudmen of the wetlands and the terrible lady known as The Guardian.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoonstone is a remarkable combination of fast, aggressive combat action and subtle role-play that, perhaps uniquely, challenges your brain - while it covers you in gore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way, if the sight of so much blood upsets you, don't worry. The blood is an option!", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:47:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/7655d89e0ff3bacce44752b0a1391ef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 20, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mindscape", "Images Software", "Rob Anderson"], "genres": ["RPG", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["MINDSCAPE", "Mindscape Entertainment", "Another Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
