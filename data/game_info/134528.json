It's called Towering Yoga Masters.</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics may appear somewhat child-friendly but don't be mistaken, this game is still a challenge. Your aim is to stack 10 different people in yoga positions into a beautiful tower without anybody falling off and hitting the floor. In version 1 there are two formations for you to complete. More may be added depending on how many plays the game gets on the various platforms it's submitted to.</p>\n<p>Game by Satch games.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking the game out today.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e053aba8119e6bde80af94e62e0730ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Satch"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
