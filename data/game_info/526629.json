The game is\u00a0open source and so you can find the link to the source code below (or here). \"MoonShot\" inspired us to think about the impossible and the moon. We combined these into a game where the player survives the impossible, a crash landing on the moon surface near\u00a0the habitation they were supposed to land at. The player must survive to set up communications and schedule a rescue mission. The player must craft items and set up drills and power in order to survive the lunar surface, while ensuring they have enough oxygen and food to last them until help arrives.</p>\n<p>The game was created by a team of Tom's.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom Poucher (@TomPoucherGames),\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom Austin (@TomAustin700),\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom Martin (@TPMartin).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/tomaustin700/GameOff2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:42:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b068a71387e93b5f6348d95d047562.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomPoucherGames", "tpmartin", "tomaustin700"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
