You are equipped with a nuclear powered headlamp that runs on glowing uranium rocks that you can find scattered around the underground. Make sure to stock up, because when the light is out, the game is over!\r\n</p>\n<p>Oh, and going up? Not an option! You can only go deeper and deeper.</p>\n<p>This game was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 48 as a first-time participant.\u00a0Unfortunately, I ran out of time for sound and code optimization. There are some BAD frame drops when chunks get loaded and unloaded.\u00a0 Hopefully I can optimize it for a post-jam version, but this is the best I could do in the available time.</p>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>\n<p>v0.1 (April 26, 2020):</p>\n<ul><li>Jam submission</li></ul>\n<p>v0.2 (April 28, 2020):</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Optimized chunk loading</li><li>Fixed collectables spawning in mid air on chunk borders</li><li>Fixed collision with collectables</li><li>Tweaked spawn rate of collectables</li><li>Timer now starts when the player starts moving</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a2b5ddec6554e896f3c6ce525c325fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["quantumseagull"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
