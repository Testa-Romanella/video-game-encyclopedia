Thus far there's only 4 levels (This is a demo/preview - As I add new features these will be fleshed out and more added). * Controls - Cursor keys to move (left &amp; right), up to jump. down while in the air to ground pound. Jump against a wall then jump again to wall jump/kick. If near the top ledge of a wall Scratch will cling on (from where you can either climb up, jump off or drop down). Notes - See how many coins you can collect on your way, and whether you can get that possibly hidden or hard to get to Mega Coin on each level. Some baddies can be stomped on, prickly ones and spiders can't (at present). Don't fall off the bottom of the level... instant life lost. There's so much more for me to add, and the levels will become a lot better as time goes by, but I am just dying for some feedback to all the work I have put in to this :) - I think you will like it! Please note - This is not the finished game and some aspects are a little rushed compared to others... Feel free to comment :) I only just added the mario like bricks and blocks seen on the first level, see how you can head them to kill enemies above? You won't see these anywhere else in the game so far as I haven't made further use of them yet. I'm going to make a lot more of the scores and level time, later too :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c2ab795b31ea6e2c4fa0c904aa5a79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MicahBailety"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
