Once you close your eyes, the world becomes you.<br/><br/>But beware of the truth... you don't play the game. The game plays you to learn about its very existence.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96</p>\n<p>By the way, we continue to make the games.
