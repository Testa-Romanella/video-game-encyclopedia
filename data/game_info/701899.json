{"id": 701899, "slug": "addlemoth-demo", "name": "Addlemoth Demo", "name_original": "Addlemoth Demo", "description": "<p>A turn-based fantasy combat puzzler about discovering what even happened in some long forgotten ruins and likely pulling your hair out along the way.</p>\n<p>Playable in English and Japanese(\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e)!</p>\n<p>When an envelope bearing a wax seal of a moth and addressed to her family arrived, Alexandria wasn't really sure what to make of it, but knew the request for her family's aid had to be taken seriously.  Contacting her friend and guide Elle, they set out to resolve things, but ended up with far more than they were expecting.<br/><br/>Solve 33 puzzles, repair the magical wards of ruins of a distant past, discover some hints about what happened, and perhaps find more questions than answers in this playable demo of Addlemoth! The game is still under active development.<br/><br/>Primarily the spare-time work of mauve (@mauvecow) to teach himself how to draw pixel art, and also homage an old favorite game series DROD, it got a little out of control and became a full game in its own right. The positively wonderful music of HeavyViper (bandcamp) (@HeavyViper) adds much to the atmosphere, check his works out!<br/></p>\n<p>Please give feedback here, to the above Twitter, or join our Discord to talk with us directly!<br/></p>\n<p>Send inquiries to mauvecow at gmail dot com, or just DM on Twitter / Discord.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:47:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28fab39933a4ae4b2cec2f30b62399b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauve"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
