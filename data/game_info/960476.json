Your goal is to destroy them with mouse clicks. But with difficult clicks. Before clicking the mouse, you must hold down the key with the corresponding keyboard letter. Otherwise, the click will not be counted. The difficulty increases with the frequency of the letters and the speed of movement. For correct clicks, you get result points and move up the difficulty curve. The game will be over as soon as the letters fly past you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/59964ba17bbcefd1d37e7df5a62b2239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soomka Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soomka Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
