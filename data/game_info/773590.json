This was an old project, so unfortunately some of the libraries and services used (facebook, ads, notifications, asset bundles) were either incompatible with the latest version of Unity I used to rebuild the game or were locked out of an old account I was using to use those services. However, I was still able to refactor most of the game so it can be built for Windows, Linux, and WebGL.</p>\r\nGAME RULES:\r\n<p>Dodge enemy attacks and kill the boss that spawns after two minutes in each level.
