It does not have any relation to the Trials game series.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players take control of a freestyle bike rider. The objective of the game is too complete the level using the most tricks possible.</p>\n<p>The game features two types of stages: the players are required to finish the level in a certain amount of time or to complete a given list of tricks.</p>\n<p>The levels for the first type of stages do not require anything else other than completing the stage while avoiding obstacles. If the player&#39;s character touches anything with any body part, they have to restart from the nearest checkpoint. The environments in the game differ drastically from each other. The players may even ride through a city where a riot takes place. </p>\n<p>The trick-oriented stages do not feature a time limit. The players have to complete a certain trick and follow the directions that are placed on the level. There are five tricks present in the game. For each successful trick, the player is awarded points based on how spectacular the trick was. For every fall, 50 points are taken away from you. These points are used to unlock new levels and to compete with other players using the in-game leaderboard.</p>\n<p>A player customization system is also present in the game. While the players are free to dress their rider however they like, it is also possible to upgrade the bike, which will affect the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2013-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02fd24f02555f6e4c419b3d02d926bb4.jpg", "website": "http://www.urbantrialfreestyle.com/", "rating": 2.67, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 988, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 39}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 97, "suggestions_count": 575, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 97, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "Nintendo 3DS", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tate Multimedia", "Strangelands"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Tate Multimedia", "TATE MULTIMEDIA S.A"], "esrb_rating": null}
