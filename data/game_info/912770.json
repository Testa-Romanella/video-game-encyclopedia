Due to the exhibitory nature of its function, the rooms of many museums are quite different from ordinary households. I am not a museum expert, but from my inexperienced game designer\u2019s view: a museum is roughly a spacious floor divided into numerous smaller sub-room with a unique shape to separate art from a different era. The shape and the size of the room often can help to enhance the tone and the vibe of the culture to which the art pieces inside belong. To that end, this game is trying to paint a playful picture of how I think the job of museum planners would be. The elegance, nuance, and complexity of such a task are brought forth by both the gameplay and the aesthetic of Museum Planner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:50:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f50c4b52976228ae25b3efc93b69c19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZericZhu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
