Drawn to life and artifice, slime overran a castle and stopped its spread. Countless bounty hunters and adventurers tried to get inside and find out what's happening behind menacing slime wall. Will you succeed?<br/></p>\n<p>Slime Castle\u00a0is a text based adventure game in which you venture into the dungeons again and again, getting loot and upgrades so that your next crawl will be more successful. Each run you will visit randomly selected rooms and will be present with different choices you can take in them. Doing right decision will result either in gains or losses so be careful.</p>\n<p>Currently Slime Castle is in early prototype stage as I am not sure whether a concept like that will be interesting to play around. There's certainly some interesting stuff I'd like to explore with the concept so if all goes well expect new builds from time to time.</p><p>Made by DNLK with artwork by Nevermore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/2723ed10b69632ec49e6d3578fe1b52d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DNLK"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
