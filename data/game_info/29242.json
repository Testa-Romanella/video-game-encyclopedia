We worked for countless days and nights to make it possible to put up this story-driven FPS game of ours within a few months on a tight budget.<br/><br/>After finishing concept, design and story elements in February 2017, development process of Soldiers of The Universe (SoTU) finally came to an end. Initially, we were planning to release SoTU in July 2017.
