The goal is to get as far as possible, collecting glitter for score along the way, and avoiding the nightmares. A typical playthrough lasts 5 to 15 minutes, but the game doesn't have a last level \u2014 and the levels never repeat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the cursor keys or else the WASD keys to move around, or hit the space bar to stand still for one turn. Being right next to a nightmare increases your fear, while moving to the next level decreases it. Glitter also helps with that; speed lets you outpace the nightmares, as for light, the effects should be obvious. Press M to toggle the map on and off; clicking in the viewport will identify a square's contents.\r\n</p>\r\nNews\r\n<p>As of 30 July 2018, the game's third release brings many changes:\r\n \r\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>level generation has been overhauled;</li>\n<li>glitter isn't just for score anymore;</li>\n<li>nightmares last longer at higher levels;</li>\n<li>the user interface has been tweaked;</li>\n<li>all Javascript is now loaded from separate files.</li></ul>\n<p>The desktop edition has been withdrawn.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Many thanks to Mark Burger and Justin Reid for beta testing and feedback; also Jessica Nichols-Vernon and Kevin C.
