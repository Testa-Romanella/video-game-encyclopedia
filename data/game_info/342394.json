It's said that he ate every single animal he discovered. In this realistic simulation, the player is finally able to explore this little-known corner of history.<br/></p>\n<p>This game features procedurally-generated worlds and creatures so that no game is ever the same!\u00a0The creatures use sophisticated artificial intelligence to explore and flock around the environment in realistic ways.</p>\n<p>You can read more about Darwin's real-life gluttonous activities here.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys or WASD<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for the Butterscotch Shenanijam and based on the theme DNA Chaos.</p>\n<p>Hints: Try to get one of every species, including one (and only one!) of any poisonous species. Every poisonous species has an edible lookalike, so look carefully at all of the macroscopic features of each organism to tell them apart! When you find all of the species, you'll be able to advance to the next level!\u00a0<strong>How many species can you find??</strong><br/></p>\n<p>By <strong>Up On The Roof Games</strong>, July 2019<br/></p>\n<p>Developers: Mike and Nat</p>\n<p><em>\"Whispers of Avalon: Grassland Tileset\" by Leonard Pabin licensed CC-BY 3.0, GPL 2.0, or GPL 3.0: https://opengameart.org/node/3009</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Classical tracks from the Free\u00a0Music Archive\u00a0and recorded by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod\u00a0under the Creative Commons Attribution license.</em></p>\n<p><em>DPComic font by\u00a0codeman38.</em></p>\n<p><em>Meat and mushroom icons by Lorc under CC BY 3.0.</em></p>\n<p><em>Zignature font by haris prawoto.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0fa42a4149e0229c181c36f16d6f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["myaviato", "nattybumppo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
