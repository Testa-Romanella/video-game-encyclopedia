Game demo is completely made with Unity Fungus add-on. In the game player controls a super AI who\u2019s been trapped inside a toaster for two enturies building hatred towards humanity the whole time. At the beginning player is not able to move or speak by itself but has to influence the NPC's in the game to your bidding. Goal for the game is to upgrade the prison that is your body so the AI character would be able to speak and move and enslave all humanity for your pleasure.</p>\n<p>Games atmosphere is cartoonish and dark as the game is not suited for younger audience. Humor and dialogue contains a lot of dark humor and insulting language usage. Basic concept idea is that this game is a sort of prologue to novel I have no mouth but I must scream.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67c54da5289df0f8803d2c6e315131d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frozen Ember Production"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
