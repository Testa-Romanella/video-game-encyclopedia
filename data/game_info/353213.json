Big thanks to that organization for providing for developers with assets to practice make games.</p>\n<p>Also want to thank mentors from Udemy course \"Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games\" for their inspiration to make this game.</p>\n<p>Besides implementing the basic functions I have added some of my own features like: tutorial for user, level progression design, boss level, implementing own difficulty logic, creating own \"Game Over\" scene, fixing all type of bugs.</p>\n<p>That is the first project which I am really proud off. I have tried to make short, complete and dynamic game.</p>\n<p>NOTE! The game does not support touch input only mouse input.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e444c6c5d74d2344979ca636741c0c50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexey Smolyaninov"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
