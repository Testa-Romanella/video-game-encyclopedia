Enemies have weaknesses to different weapons - if you match each lane weapon with an enemy's weakness, you'll inflict more damage!</p><p>There are also powerups which affect different aspects of the game (the damage you make, the speed of the enemies, and the health of your castle).</p><p>The game itself was developed in Unity, the art with Aseprite, and the music with FL Studio and royalty-free soundfonts.</p><p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>Installation instructions<br/><p>Under Windows, unzipping the .zip file and running the .exe (while keeping the data folder next to it) should suffice.</p><p>Under Linux (tested under Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca 64 bit), doing a cd to the decompressed file and executing</p><p><em>./Keep\\ Defenders.x86</em></p><p>or</p><p><em>./Keep\\ Defenders.x86_64</em></p><p>should be enough. If not, try executing the following beforehand:</p><p><em>chmod +x Keep\\ Defenders.x86</em></p><p>or</p><p><em>chmod +x Keep\\ Defenders.x86_64</em></p><p>If that doesn't work, try modifying the file's permissions or moving the game to a directory in which you actually have permission to do such things as running an executable.</p><p>The Mac build is available but untested at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f25/f2539add56dd0f25405ab330947e67f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["marcciosilva"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
