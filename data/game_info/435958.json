You need to keep yourself alive by Hunting/Gathering Berries for food and Collecting water. You can collect wood and once you get 25 you you be able to build a signal fire. Once a signal fire is built you have a 40% chance of a ship appearing. You can also scavage the island looking for upgrades to your actions, but you only have a 40% chance of it working. It is possible to upgrade your scavage, max is 50%. If you go 3 days without food or water you will die and lose the game.</p>\n<p>Move the dice from the dice tray to a matching number in the colored panels. Sixes are wild and can be placed anywhere. Once you have finished placing the dice you can click the End Of Day button to process the actions. You get 3 rerolls per day. If you click the reroll button and the dice don\u2019t change its not a bug it just means you rolled the same number.</p>\n<p>To win the game you need to get 25 wood, build a signal fire and then signal a ship.</p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES</p>\n<p>The difficulty is kind of on the hard end. <br/>The number of Wood Required on the Build Signal Fire panel is wrong. The tip below it is correct.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:24:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08a/08a1549e8a1cf5f897005815e0a246ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KunoNoOni"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
