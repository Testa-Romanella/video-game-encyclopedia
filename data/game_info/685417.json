They're on a mission and nothing you can do will stop them.</p>\n<p>Your mission is to unblock the pipes on the other side of the river\u00a0and post the time it took you to do so - advanced players might be able to finish (and compare their speed-runs to others)\u00a0but only the truly elite will discover just how far your game timer can extend IF you can stay alive that long (hint: you'll need a calendar).</p>\n<p>This game is short (it's only one level) but it will still challenge you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394b78e35bc77fe88f35f008a787e515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lfrohling"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
