The Color switching mechanic follows a rock paper scissors model. Hitting your preferred enemy type will do increased damage against the enemy.\u00a0As you avoid getting hit by your weakness you evolve stronger shots and wider spread. Getting hit by anything other then your weakness is reduced by your shields but when your weakness hits you the color switch takes place and you become that color and inherit its weaknesses and strengths.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W, S, A, D or Left Thumbstick to move.</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button or Right Trigger\u00a0to fire primary attack.</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button or Left Trigger\u00a0to fire a missle.</p>\n\n<p>Try to survive until the end. Hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb79ecf2530734284cece5d579400bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gotsanity"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
