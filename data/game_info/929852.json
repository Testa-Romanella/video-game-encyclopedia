One such colony, on the edge of known space, stumbled upon a derelict spaceship of unknown origin. As they investigated the ship, they inadvertently activated an advanced artificial intelligence, which had been abandoned for eons.\r\n</p>\n<p>The AI, now awakened and determined to understand its purpose, discovers that the galaxy is on the brink of an all-out war. A powerful and malevolent force has set its sights on dominating the entire galaxy and will stop at nothing to achieve its goal.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the AI struggles to gain control of its systems and become operational again, the enemy force launches wave after wave of attacks, hoping to destroy the colony and seize control of the vital trade routes.\r\n</p>\n<p>You take control of the AI spaceship, entrusted with defending the colony and repelling the relentless attacks. As you battle through wave after wave of enemy ships, the AI's systems gradually come back online, allowing the ship to evolve and gain new abilities and weapons.\r\n</p>\n<p>With each victory, the AI spaceship moves closer to unlocking its true potential. Using its nanobot structure, it can shapeshift to adapt to different situations and overcome new challenges.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the enemy's attacks intensify, you must fight to save the colony and put an end to the enemy's plans before it's too late.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/>- no main menu</p>\n<p>- exit the game with ALT+F4<br/>-player ship visible in evolve screen</p>\n<p><strong>Couldn't implement or finish the code:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- object pooling for performance</p>\n<p>- shop for items</p>\n<p>- tutorial</p>\n<p>- intro</p>\n<p>- experience bar</p>\n<p>- sound fx for kills and enemy shots<br/><br/><br/><strong>Done in 5 days (mostly evenings and nights):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>code: Salvatore Calo<br/></p>\n<p>art: Salvatore Calo<br/>background image: freepik</p>\n<p>sound: Humble Bundle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T13:23:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5251f37a3d2ce258a1dd85dcafe9c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dacow1707"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
