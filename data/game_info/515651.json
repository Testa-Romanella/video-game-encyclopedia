Thus, the project HEC\u00a0(Human Entertainment Computer) is called into life. Cyborgs who can think, feel and learn by themselves are fabricated and trained in a laboratory to use them as entertainment slaves. The young\u00a0Android Ars feels constricted and abandoned during the training process and so he breaks out of the laboratory. Can you help him explore the world?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>In HEC you take control of Android Ars and protect him from the harms of the world. As the action control unit of his life system, you cannot directly influence his movements. Instead, you must provide correct actions for specific situations so that Ars does not fall from a cliff or is destroyed by fiends. Plan ahead to reach your goal!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Kevin Hinker: Game Design, Programming, Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:32:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0b6107653adc4609d8d4b29cb04350f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Hinker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
