Choosing incorrectly can result in a penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn order to destroy a target, you must not miss a beat. Missing a beat or choosing the wrong attack resets the enemies health gauge. Fill the health gauge to destroy the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has 15 rounds starting with a pre-tutorial round. There are various enemy types and each round has a unique combination that you must learn to overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is also a dash movement ability that makes the game fast paced. Use this to avoid enemy attacks, or use it to close the distance so that you can land a melee beat.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T03:54:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0caf154c08abec4c3475857a785dd8f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garett A C Hunter"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garett A C Hunter"], "esrb_rating": null}
