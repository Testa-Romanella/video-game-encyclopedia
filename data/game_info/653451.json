At the end of each round, the Lord of Spirits will randomly discard a piece of land in a path never traveled before. When the decision maker steps onto the abandoned land, the card capacity will be reduced and several cards will be randomly stripped of their rule power. In the game, you need to make card decisions based on the existing environment, and be careful of mines. The cards that have been decided are removed from the total card library, and the final settlement is made when the total number of cards on one side reaches zero or exceeds the counter point.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aefd5b59d48235976da3dd347461c168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CNKI_Promise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
