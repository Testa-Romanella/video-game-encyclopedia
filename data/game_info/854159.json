As you progress, the levels get more challenging, and I tried to play around with some of the physics materials and how the objects were angled to complete the levels. The one thing I am a bit concerned about looking at other people's submissions is the lack of art that I have in mine. It looks very generic, and later down the line, for future projects, I want to incorporate better-looking assets and particle effects.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck on the last level it took me a lot of tries to complete! I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecbb198290f791801365d41effdcb8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shugo16"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
