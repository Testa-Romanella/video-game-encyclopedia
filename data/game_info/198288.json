Less then a month ago I set out to become a game developer, with no skills in coding, music or art. Frustrated with the learning process I set my self a milestone to make a fully playable and functional game, and this is the result.</p>\n<p>It is playable, but it is very short, this is basically the tutorial levels and nothing more. If anyone will be interested I will add more levels with increasing difficulty. All feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00eef1298b3d15a3edd370903c0727dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DeguDevs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
