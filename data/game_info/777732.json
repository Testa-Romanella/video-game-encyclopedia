I am following a course on GameDev.tv, linked here. This is an extension of the first finished game, meaning I added mechanics myself to improve the game. The mechanic I added in this game is an area of zero gravity. Push any objects into the area and let them float around! More changes are listed below.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you are a free flying pawn that shoots cannonballs from  your face. You have 50 cannonballs to fire at the various objects within  the scene to cause chaos.\u00a0 The top left corner will have messages  showing how much ammo you have left. Once you run out of ammo, firing  will instead start a timer to reset the level. The controls in this game  are simple.\r\n </p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong>: Move around\r\n</li><li><strong>Space Bar</strong>: Fire a cannonball\r\n</li><li><strong>R</strong>: Restart the game</li><li><strong>Escape</strong>: Exit the game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Go in and have some fun wrecking the warehouse!</p>\n<p>All changes:</p>\n<ul><li>Added textures to the rest of the building.</li><li>Projectiles spawn in front of the player instead of directly on top that causing jittering if firing while moving.</li><li>Auto exposure has been removed inside the warehouse.</li><li>Two new prop types: Pallet and Water Tank.</li><li>More props placed everywhere.</li><li>Props can now move on start.</li><li>Area added that disables gravity on props\u00a0while inside and\u00a0enables\u00a0when they\u00a0leave. </li><li>Ammo count increased to 50.</li><li>Game will restart when pressing R.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231c5fd5f7a51cc9a2760b2e2fd1d981.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
