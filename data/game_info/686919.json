(DEMO)", "description": "<p>A hit at a bed &amp; breakfast goes wrong when you wind up snowed in before you can get away. </p>\n<p>Now, you\u2019re trapped in here with eight other people, all trying to figure out who did it. If you\u2019re here when the snow melts and the cops show up, you\u2019re dead in the water. There\u2019s only one option - <strong>kill everyone without being caught. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>That\u2019s  easier said than done, though. There\u2019s no way you can take on all of  these people in one day, so you\u2019re going to have to do this one at a  time, under the cover of night. Who are you going to kill first? Who  next?\r\n</p>\n<p>Every night, the bodies pile up, the suspects dwindle, and  avoiding suspicion gets harder and harder. Will you make it out  scot-free, or will you fumble under the pressure? <br/></p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>This is only the DEMO for Spoiler Alert! You're the Killer., released for Halloween 2021. The official game will (hopefully) be released on Valentine's Day 2022, but we'll see! For more news, content, and updates, please refer to the official Tumblr blog for it, or my various social medias. Thank you, and happy Halloween!<br/></p>\n<p>[31.10.21] -- Release (1.0)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T03:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/891ab2ab0157a0fc4021930042bea8be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["beckett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
