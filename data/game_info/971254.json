Phoenix Erupting", "description": " You play the role of Allan Martin, an occasionally suave British superspy armed with a licence to cause an international incident. Can you survive international assassins? Can you stop an evil mastermind's nefarious plans? Can you avoid contracting an STD?<br/> Welcome to Phoenix Erupting, a visual novel brought to you by the people who played Police Quest IV and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. You are sent by your bosses to investigate an evil European megalomaniac with dreams of world domination or whatever. Charm, fight, and shag your way through exotic locales such as Latin America, Monte Carlo, lush volcanic islands, and Milton Keynes.<br/><br/>A VISUAL NOVEL?<br/> Did you ever grow up reading \u2018Choose Your Own Adventures\u2019 books? Then you\u2019re a nerd. So are we, and that\u2019s why we made this game. The other reason we made this game is because it\u2019s the genre of game that requires minimal programming and game design.<br/> But within those limitations anything can happen \u2013 you can catch a venereal disease, have something shoved up your arse, listen to a man going to the toilet, and literally get covered in shit \u2013 and that\u2019s if you play the game well!<br/> There are well over 100 different decisions trees spread throughout the game \u2013 some of these decisions not affecting the game at all, while others can result in an untimely death. This game has 12 different final endings giving the game great replay value. Another feature that gives this game great replay value is the \u2018skip dialogue\u2019 button, which makes the game go super-fast, although you might have no idea what\u2019s happening!<br/><br/>A \u201cCOMEDY\u201d \u201cGAME\u201d<br/> This game is so funny you\u2019ll not only piss your own pants, but also other people\u2019s pants as well! This side-splitting adventure will have you laughing non-stop at jokes about poop, drugs, murder, women, alcoholism, foreigners, and dead children. This game also contains reference humour and meta gags so you can feel good about how clever you are.<br/> Because you get to choose how the story progresses it\u2019s your fault if you don\u2019t find this game funny. If you\u2019d made the right choices this game would\u2019ve been hilarious \u2013 we promise.<br/>[Note: If you find our attempt at humour is of the \u2018so bad it\u2019s good\u2019 variety, then that was our intention all along]<br/><br/>A BUNCH OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS<br/> Brilliantly written characters make this world come alive. Be careful how you interact with people, as your reputation with certain characters can affect how the story plays out and which story branches you end up going down. Sometimes having a good or bad reputation might make the game more interesting. Or more tedious and boring. It might even be the difference between saving the Earth and being buried under 6-feet of it.<br/> Additionally, there are many more colourful secondary characters to meet, several of whom you can kick in the balls!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T10:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06f9b04baa61c84506c22cd6ac3338a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SC Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
