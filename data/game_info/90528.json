{"id": 90528, "slug": "octodad", "name": "Octodad", "name_original": "Octodad", "description": "<p>(This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest Catch can be purchased here.)<br />\nOctodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.<br />\nThe player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around while his body flops along. The player\u2019s goals are often simple household chores made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over Octodad\u2019s body.<br />\nBeing an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces, grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength. But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad\u2019s family will grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it\u2019s game over for Octodad!<br />\nPlease e-mail bugs and crash reports with OS X version, video card type, and system specs to feedback@octodadgame.com.<br />\nPC Minimum System Requirements<br />\nOperating System:Microsoft\u00ae Windows XP/Vista/7 with DirectX\u00ae 9.0cProcessor:2.6 GHz Pentium\u00ae IV or equivalent AMD Athlon\u00ae processorRAM:1.5 GBHard Disk Space:1 GBVideo:Intel\u00ae GMA950 Integrated Graphics or DirectX\u00ae 9.0c Capable Video Card<br />\nPC Recommended System Requirements<br />\nProcessor:Dual Core 2.4GHzRAM:3 GBVideo:512 MB NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae 8800 GTX or ATI Radeon\u00ae HD 3870 or better<br />\nMac Minimum System Requirements<br />\nOperating System:Mac OSX 10.5.8Processor:Intel\u00ae ProcessorRAM:2 GBHard Disk Space:1 GBVideo:NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae 8600M GT or ATI Radeon\u00ae X1600<br />\nMac Recommended System Requirements<br />\nOperating System:Mac OSX 10.6 or 10.7Processor:Intel\u00ae Core 2 Duo processorRAM:4 GBVideo:NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae 9600M GT or ATI Radeon\u00ae HD 4670 or better</p>\n<p>NVIDIA(R) and PhysX(R) are registered trademarks of NVIDIA Corporation and are used under license.<br />\nFMOD Sound System, copyright \u00a9 Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2013.<br />\nIrrlicht Engine copyright \u00a9 2002-2010 Nikolaus Gebhardt.<br />\nIJG JPEG software copyright (C) 1991-2012, Thomas G.
