Actually the government did brainwash well, they makes up everything, make their people believe they are living in a one of best country, believe everything in North Korea is really fantastic and reliable. From propaganda posters you can see some most ridiculous things like 'North Korea got the FIFA World Cup\u2019 and \u2018North Korean iron fist defeated \"evil USA\u201d\u2019, what the impossible things but North Korea uses these as public posters, those lies make this country beautiful in fantasy.</p>\n<p>Few warning boxes between the posters, which is the deep reality of North Korea, you should keep out of them but you can have a look inside if you want.</p>\n<p>There are also 5 Kim\u2019s portraits on the wall, that telling you don\u2019t go outside, and you must be respect for him, you shouldn\u2019t spray water on him but you can. If you do something like that then you\u2019ll find the way get out of the room.</p>\n<p>If you successfully get out of the room, that means you\u2019ve already decided not listen to dear leader Kim Jung un, so you got the mission - scrub the 12 nukes, destroy Kim\u2019s \u201cNuke Plan\u201d.</p>\n<p>Finally, final scene displays when you complete the mission, it\u2019s celebratIng for your fight. There is an interesting thing happening, just have a try!<br/></p>\n<p>From this concept, I wanna reflect seclusion policy is totally wrong, you can make everything looks nice and peaceful temporarily, but people can never just stay there and everyone be smile forever, except you are the only king of the world. As long as any dangerous exist around, you should face them even fight with them, defeat possible difficulty, that\u2019s the ultimately true way to live.</p>\n\n<p>GLHF!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d8434549c447c4a3c3b26466b64bf764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Milo Wang"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
