On your side, cacti, gnomes, and more... And coming at you is a relentless animal army of lizard bureaucrats, wily foxes, and clunky crabs. Can you survive? Try this simple HTML5 game and see!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is an early test of game development and design. All thoughts, comments, and feedback are welcome! Thank you for playing.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Thanks: </strong>Glitch Garden only came into being through the tremendous Unity course on Udemy, taught by the glorious Ben Tristem and Brice Fernandes, using gorgeous, free assets from Glitch the Game and the Tiny Speck team, makers of Slack. There are some incredible teachers and creators on this planet, and I'm thankful to have learned and benefited from them.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/133f7c682128fcce89a0f413a133b1fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beroshi Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
