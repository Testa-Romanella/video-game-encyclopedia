Explore a variety of creepy locations, including Mario's Cottage, Leonardo's Villa, Haunted Boardwalk, and the Spooky Mall.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay mechanics and loop</strong><br/>Your objective is to use your equipment to locate the ghost and ghost room to see how it interacts with the environment, items, and hiding places. Once you have gathered enough information, it's up to you to make an educated guess about the type of ghost you're dealing with. Once you've made your guess, the exorcist can come in and take care of the ghost.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Ghost interactions and music</strong><br/>But beware - ghosts can be unpredictable and dangerous, so be sure to keep your wits about you. With atmospheric visuals, spooky sound effects, and a haunting (badass) soundtrack from the musical artist Sodaguyz, Untitled Ghost Game will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>So join us on this bone-chilling journey into the unknown, brought to you by a small passionate team of indie developers who are dedicated to bringing you the best in 2D ghost hunting gameplay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T04:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c3386d17aa839dc65f9b55989684ab86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dubscr"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dubscr"], "esrb_rating": null}
