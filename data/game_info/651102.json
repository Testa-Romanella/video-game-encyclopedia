{"id": 651102, "slug": "at-your-feet", "name": "At Your Feet", "name_original": "At Your Feet", "description": "In this comedy game, you take on the role of Emma, a twenty year old college student of Mexican origin.<br/><br/>Emma  has a secret.  Everyone does.  But no, it's not that she likes girls.   We're in 2021 and she's pretty open about that part.  No, her secret is  more curious than that: she has a foot fetish.  Something about feet  gets her all worked up.<br/><br/>And what job could be more perfect for her than working part-time at a spa center doing pedicures?<br/><br/>Emma  is quite happy with her life, but there is still one thing she'd like.   Everyone needs love, after all.  And for Emma, this has always been a  bit of a sore spot.  Even with her ex, Melanie, she's never been able to  find the courage to open up about her kink.<br/><br/>Things are going to change for Emma though, because three women are  about to enter Emma's life-- three very different women that may be able  to accept Emma for who she is and make her the happiest woman alive!<h3>The Love Interests</h3><br/><br/><strong>Victoria</strong> - Victoria  is athletic, determined, and passionate about sports and other physical  activities.  She left college to pursue a career as a professional  athlete and it will be up to Emma to either support her choice or  convince her that it's better to have a plan B just in case.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Lucy </strong>- Independent and strong, Lucy is a  feminist, an artist, a part-time DJ, and, of course, a lover of all  things goth.  Her erotic horror comic books are well known.  Add to that  the way she acts and dresses and she's practically a celebrity.  But  what does she have to do with Emma?  Well, turns out they were  schoolmates a long time ago.  And maybe Emma has forgotten about her,  but Lucy certainly didn't forget about Emma.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Natalie </strong>- This gorgeous blonde is older than Emma by upwards of ten years, but  that doesn't make her any less appealing.  Natalie is quite gifted,  being a genius in math and a savant on the piano.  With a failed  marriage behind her, Natalie is ready to start a new chapter in her  life.  She's never been with a woman before, but meeting Emma will  change her life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T17:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/59083cecad82b2a8debc380e78d1e72b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Winter Wolves"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Winter Wolves"], "esrb_rating": null}
