I had very little time during this jam due to being busy for most of the jam period so I decided to stick to something much smaller as opposed to what my usual jam entries are like. I also originaly wanted to make a browser version but unfortunately did not have enough time to figure out a way to do this properly with Unreal Engine 4.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bb/7bb1fb466f7a0d2044ac22ff7a6b1d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kreekakon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
