It is a traditional and popular game, and thousands of millions of people are playing this game every day. <br/><br/>Army Chess differs from the international chess game, on the following four aspects. <br/>1. Layout of chess piece is changeable, rather than fixed. <br/>2. Moving rules depend on positions, rather than on chess pieces themselves. <br/>3. Attacking results depend on ranks, rather than on who starts the attack. <br/>4. Game type can be \"Hidden Rank\" or \u201cVisible Rank\u201d, rather than the latter only. <br/><br/>Because of these differences, Army Chess requires more strategies and can become more interesting. <br/><br/><br/>Main Features: <br/><br/>(Game mode) <br/>Human-CPU game <br/><br/>(Game types) <br/>Visible Rank <br/>Hidden Rank <br/><br/>(Game) <br/>Playback <br/>Demo\uff08CPU-CPU\uff09 <br/>Undo <br/>Live\uff08WeChat\uff09 <br/><br/>(Options) <br/>Move Firstly\uff08Me, CPU\uff09 <br/>Handicap Number\uff08Visible type:0-10, Hidden type:0-25\uff09 <br/>Layout\uff08Manual\uff0cRandom\uff09 <br/>Draw Conditions\uff08Moves, Repetition\uff09 <br/><br/>(Tools) <br/>Tool (Import and Save for layout and game\uff09 <br/>Scores \uff08Current game, History game\uff09 <br/>Leaderboards <br/>Points in $ and Assistant Points in \uffe5 <br/><br/>(Others) <br/>Social network service\uff08WeChat, QQ, Weibo, Facebook, Twitter, EMail\uff09 <br/>Multi-languages for chess pieces\uff08Chinese\uff0cEnglish\uff0cJapanese, Weapon images, Rank badges\uff09 <br/>User Feedback <br/><br/><br/>Some Rules: <br/>Each side has 25 chess pieces of 12 different ranks (1-9, A, B, and C).
