For the sake of earning money to live, you routinely dive into the distant Kuiper belt in search of riches within its small bodies and moonlets. In addition to life-threatening asteroids, you have to deal with rival miners coming to jump your claim, as well as police ships checking up on your (nonexistent) licence.</p><p>The Kuiper Run can be played in full, completely free - the price is there if you want to support me and the project. Binaries available for Windows - Linux and MacOS coming as soon as I work out how.</p><p>Main font used: Bitmap Banking by Michelle Lehmann / scriptmonkeys.us<br/></p><p>Placeholder graphics from SpriteLib by Ari Feldman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a79ab13eabd8fa27614e32be21132c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ice Spark Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
