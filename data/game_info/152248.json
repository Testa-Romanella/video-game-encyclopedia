Your <em>Grobar</em> on the top left of the screen indicates your progress toward the next level. Your power grows with level, and the bar increases the faster you go! You need this bar to shoot however! Use your levels to power up, or to obtain newer and more powerful guns! Careful, the stronger the gun, the stronger the kickback. Running into enemies while slipping and sliding around also damages them, as well as yourself! Last long enough and <em>Bosses </em>eventually spawn! How high can you get your level?\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/YaomonKS</p>\n<p>http://kylesun.net/index.php</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c5e1db1ba8432605191e4d68ab2f13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["yaomon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
