The game will be focused on fun PVP and PVE fighting mechanics with different classes to choose. I also have a story i wanna add to the game as a campaign mode as well as an unique progression system of stats, skills and gear.</p>\n<p><strong>Places where you can find more stuff about the game</strong></p>\n<p>hexway.com<br/></p>\n<p>youtube.com/adrianks47</p>\n<p>facebook.com/Hexway-En-363966967452671/</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Latest release : DEMO 0.3</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe third DEMO have just been released after a year of idle time :(<br/>The focus in this one was just to improve the learning curve and difficulty of the game. The beginning waves are easier, and the mechanics are introduced gradually. The last waves, on the other hand, are very challenging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f659c5ce8b0deef463ef570daaaf4567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Red Groovy"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
