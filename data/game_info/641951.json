Spin your head 360 degrees :)<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to early versions of another first-person shooter. Understanding how few good games there are on the market, a long-time love for them, and just a desire to please people and entertain them just made me start making my own game. In fact, I have long been (like all of you) a fan of games, so I understand what a big burden I decided to take on myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And because of that I decided to 1. regularly post builds of the game for your evaluation and troubleshooting 2. Take into account as much as possible your opinion in the development since no one knows how to make the game better than the players and even I, much to my regret :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main goal: to make the game so that it would bring pleasure to both me and the players. And then publication on Steam and perhaps EGS. But so far, this is just a dream...</p>\n<p>But the main feature, if I may say so, is that the game will be developed on the fly and even I do not know now what will build 0.1.3 or 0.5.9 and what happens to the project in the future.</p>\n<p>But anyway whatever happens with the project in the future I would really appreciate all kinds of help that you guys can give me. Both for money and for advice on developing and improving the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a21/a210cc26f8240ee814f2fd04bfec4a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vladiss9829"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
