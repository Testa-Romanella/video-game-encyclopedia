To change the direction of moving objects, create walls (lines) by dragging mouse pointer. You should avoid, or make use of, obstacles, enemies and exploding mines. Sometimes, it is necessary to unlock you way by keys and to use accelerators to go faster or change direction of moving objects. To obtain a better score, or even to accomplish a level with short timeout, you should pick bonuses.</p><p>Karamball provides also simple customization features, such as, changing or adding the background music, and manual creation of new levels or changing existing ones.</p><p>For more information see the Karamball home page https://bitbucket.org/Rado1/karamball/wiki/Home</p><p>Have fun!<br/></p><p>Current version: 1.2, January 2015<br/>Engine: ZGameEditor + ZgeBox2D physics library + ZgeSL sound library</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fe/0fe59fb1d66b1fed38588088107a76ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rado1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
