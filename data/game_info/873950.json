The waves are randomly created with increasing difficulty. New enemies appear in higher waves. After each wave you can upgrade one stat by selecting an enhacement\u00a0and buy new weapons with the coins you earn. After you die you earn crystals with which you can unlock new ships and try to beat your old highscore.</p>\n<p>You can create a new account to save your progess (only works till you refresh the page or if you download it) or just play as a guest.<br/>When playing as a guest you have to option to play unlocked mode where you start with enough crystals to buy every ship and weapon.</p>\n<p>Since I only had about a two\u00a0weeks to work on the game for some\u00a0time each day, there are still a lot of things missing that I had liked to add. If I find the time I will still add them at some point.</p>\n<p>Currently there are 8 different enemies, 6 different weapons (only 5 work) and 76 different Enhancements in the game.</p>\n<p>Game is not at all balanced!</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>movement - W,A,S,D<br/>shoot - Spacebar/LMB<br/>change weapon - R</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Spaceships:\u00a0https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-enemy-spaceship-2d-sprites-pixel-art<br/>Enemies:\u00a0https://foozlecc.itch.io/void-fleet-pack-1 <br/>UI: https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-space-shooter-game-user-interface<br/>SFX: https://gamesupply.itch.io/video-game-sound-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:11:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d16abb68c4646639f0cee5dc95a21f38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["UnluckyGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
