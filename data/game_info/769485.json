RGB rush allows you to develop your colour creation abilities.<h3>Colour spaces:</h3><br/>The following colour spaces are available to practice in. These are all the different ways you are able to assemble a colour from individual components. <br/><strong>CMYK</strong> - Sort by cyan, magenta, yellow and key - used in printing.<br/><strong>HSV</strong> - Sort by colour, intensity and brightness.<br/><strong>RGB</strong> - Sort by red, green and blue - The actual colours your pixels emit<br/><strong>HEX single</strong> - Practice understanding base 16. <br/><strong>HEX</strong> - Same as RGB, except letters can be numbers too.<h3>Accuracy</h3><br/>The higher your accuracy, the better your score will be. Can you keep it above 98%?<h3>Ranges</h3><br/>By default, you can move the sliders between 0 and 255. However, this is not always the standard, so this range is adjustable per channel. <br/>Select from: <br/>0-360<br/>0-255<br/>0-100 <br/>0-1<h3>Gamemodes:</h3><strong>Practice</strong> - Go at your own pace, get familiar with how the colours work. Your cumulative score is saved.<br/><strong>Blindfolded</strong> - You cannot see your colour until you submit it. You can then keep trying or skip.<br/><strong>Timed</strong> - You\u2019re on the clock. The closer your guesses are, the more time you get back. Your best score is saved.<h3>Example use cases:</h3>- Prototyping<br/><br/>- Website design<br/>- Photo editing<br/>- Digital art<br/>- Show off at an interview<br/>- Impress your crush", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T05:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb28c93b9fcad5a9e5b829a37e1258d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
