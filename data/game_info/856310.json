The game is a direct continuation and development of the first part. The sequel has become much larger, more serious, more interesting and has acquired many new mechanics that will help you survive or brighten up your leisure time in the game. You are free to engage in animal breeding, the production of alcohol for the manufacture of various drinks and Molotov cocktails, brewing, cooking, farming, building and strengthening your base (electricity will help you!) Or just collect food and go on a journey across a diverse world accompanied by the rain. Potions will help you grow faster and stronger, cooking will open up many satisfying dishes for you, and your own farm will supply you with all the resources you need. In the game you will not be bored if you love freedom of action and know how to entertain yourself!<br/></p>\n<p>Prepare a sword, sharpen it on an anvil, put on obsidian armor, stock up on food with potions and go into the bowels to get magma crystals to create the best equipment in the game!
