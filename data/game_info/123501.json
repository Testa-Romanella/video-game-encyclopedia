{"id": 123501, "slug": "mother-ship", "name": "Mother Ship", "name_original": "Mother Ship", "description": "<p>Made in around 30 hours (sleep included :^) ) for Ludum Dare 42. <br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/mother-ship<br/><br/></p>\n<p>(You can skip reading and download the game immediatly by going straight below, but I really advise you to at least read the controls, since I didn't have enough time to add a tutorial.)<br/><br/></p>\n\n\r\nIntro\r\n\n<p>The galaxy is collapsing. A giant, nightmarish black hole is slowly growing, consuming everything in its path. And on this path is our own solar system.<br/>\u00a0<br/>You are an highly advanced A.I operating the Ark, the first faster-than-light colony ship, fitted with hundred of millions of cryogenic pods to carry humans through the depths of space. Yet, it is not enough to carry the entirety of Earth's population, and building the Ark has mostly depleted the planet of its resources. You must colonize other star systems and exploit them in order to upgrade the Ark and further improve its capacity, while fleeing from the ever growing black hole. <br/>Of course, you're not supposed to save everyone... some sacrifices are necessary. Because you're running out of time. And out of space.<br/></p>\n\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\n<ul><li>Probe and colonize nearby systems to gather the minerals you will need to upgrade the Ark. The mining speed depends on the population and the mines level, which can also be improved by spending minerals.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Population will grow over time, depending on the system\u2019s habitability. If it is under 40%, population will instead decline exponentially. You can terraform the system\u2019s planets by spending minerals to increase its habitability.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>After some time, the black hole will arrive. When it approaches a system, it will slowly decrease its habitability until it reaches 0, so evacuate it quickly !</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The systems stats are always randomized, so you will require a different strategy at each restart. However, Sol will always have 100% habitability and 0 minerals, so pop left there will grow fast but be utterly useless. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>You only have one ship, so it might be difficult to handle the increasing </li>population. You may have to leave some of them behind to save the rest\u2026<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Keep fleeing upward. You may or may not find a way to escape.</li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nControls :\r\n\n<ul><li>Use the MOUSE to interact.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>WASD or ARROW KEYS to move the camera.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Don't forget to press SPACE or E anytime to pause the game. It will give you more time to plan ahead and navigate through the messy UI.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> You can press F to toggle fullscreen, but I heavily advise you AGAINST it. I didn't have enough time to properly scale the UI, it will mess it even more. The text won't be correctly centered either.</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\r\nChangelog :\r\n\n<p>13/08 : Added a Linux and Mac OSX release (didn't test, tell me if it doesn't work). Made some bugfixing : sound not properly playing, menu not showing when clicking on another system, black hole danger radius not growing with the hole itself. Fixed pop growth rate. Changed pause key from SPACE to E because of some weird engine bug with the SPACE key.</p>\n<p>13/08 : Added back SPACE as a pause key, but you still can use E if you prefer. Fixed a bug where the menus wouldn't close properly.</p>\n\n<p>14/08 : Quickly fixed a game breaking bug where under certain conditions, you could withdraw more population from a system than you actually had there, effectively \u201cspawning\u201d free new humans.</p>\n\n<p>Known bugs/problems :</p>\n<p>- The interface. I didn't have enough time to make it more readable before compo's end, but I'm still working on it.<br/>- You may not be able to interact with some systems. For lack of better solution, moving the camera around usually seems to fix it.</p>\n<p>If you see any bug, don't hesitate to report it in the comments !</p>\n\n<p>Tools used :</p>\n<p>-Engine : Godot</p>\n<p>-Graphics : Aseprite</p>\n<p>-Sound : sfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5cb04f3adfa621d07568d8753753498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Whismirk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
