However, after his death, his soul was not transcended, but was forever trapped in the tomb. It took several hundred years for his tomb to become well-known to humans, but he did not want his quiet life to be disturbed. He would use his means to punish those who came to the tomb, and soon, The archaeologist fell ill and died. After the royal court learned of this, they sent a large number of reconnaissance knights and guards to the tomb, but all of them died mysteriously. Only one grower named Allen survived, and he found that the place was filled with evil and filth. The guards of the pharaoh and the Skeleton King were here, punishing those outsiders<br/>Quickly, as the tomb opened, the mysterious forces led the mountain spirits and spiders to the village closest to the tomb. The church in the village knew about it and sent many knights to defend it. However, they did not expect that the mysterious forces could manipulate people's minds, causing some knights to rebel and become fallen knights. These knights could not actually be considered human beings and were called undead by the locals. Later, the church also gave up, The royal family sent many carriages and guards to pick up the priest and some nuns, and sealed off the area<br/>A few years later, in order to train powerful knights and guards, the royal family formulated a plan for the Rebirth Gate, which sent personnel to enter tombs, villages, and nearby cemeteries for training. However, if they entered hastily, they would inevitably be controlled by mysterious forces. Fortunately, after years of research by the royal family, it was discovered that the guards in the tombs could control mountain spirits and magic spiders because they had acquired an element, The name of this element is Mana. A small amount of this element exists in Grave goods, which cannot be obtained in large quantities. Royal alchemists invented the artificial darken index, which can also be obtained by taking medicine. But ordinary people use it to reduce their life span. Some people are born with this ability, such as growers. They may be ordinary church knights, but they have a strong mind and do not become degenerate knights, After learning about it, the nearby church incorporated them, and their powerful strength seemed to indicate that a disaster would come<br/><br/>1.
