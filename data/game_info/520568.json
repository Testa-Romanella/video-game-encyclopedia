{"id": 520568, "slug": "focus-on-the-goal", "name": "Focus On The Goal", "name_original": "Focus On The Goal", "description": "<p>This game is in the design of going through a 4 year college experience. The first level is the easiest, but is the most intimidating and this is the level where you get used to the controls and is really pretty simple when you just take a breath and used to it, similar to your freshman year where you are getting used to the new feel of an unfamiliar campus and getting used to new people and a new environment. Level two is a step up in difficulty but now you should be used to the controls. Sophomore year starts to feel like a grind, but there is a big gap that you need to get through to continue on, which is declaring your major. Level three is now where the real work begins but at this point you should be invested and interested enough to keep playing. Junior year is where the real grind is, this is where you are continually struggling, but are still chasing that goal of getting to senior year. Finally, level four is where it all wraps up. Senior year has the end in sight and is still a lot of work but you are maybe more motivated now that the goal feels more achievable. Through this game we try to highlight that there are going to be gaps and there are going to be times where you feel like there is no end in sight, you run into danger and you will get frustrated. College is not supposed to be easy to accomplishment and that is why there will be a sense of accomplishment when we finally get out of here. (Hint if you touch the ceiling you can jump again so spamming the up button might help if it gets too hard)</p>\n<p>Credited to FWKD gaming:</p>\n<p>Savannah <strong>F</strong>uller, Isaiah\u00a0<strong>W</strong>illiamson, Alex\u00a0<strong>K</strong>ing, Nate\u00a0<strong>D</strong>eyman\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faa0b7b365c25036e6a868b7cd9c83ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fwkd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
