It was developed using Ren'Py.</p>\n\r\nSynopsis\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen four high school students go missing after exploring a local haunt spot, Mythology teacher Thalia senses that supernatural forces are the real cause of the disappearance. Too busy (or perhaps lazy) to investigate herself, she bribes her apathetic TA to examine the scene for clues. Lucas approaches the task with his usual sluggish indifference, but even he is astounded by what he uncovers.</p>\n\r\nCharacters<br/>\n\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>\r\n\t&gt; Kinetic gameplay &lt;\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t&gt; 1280x720 resolution &lt;\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t&gt; Full English voice acting &lt;\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t&gt; Complete playthrough in ~15 minutes &lt;</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\nI'm using free assets for this game, released under the CC BY-NC 3.0 license.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>GUI</strong> - potouto<br/>\n<strong>Sprites</strong> - Shida<br/>\n<strong>Music</strong> - Kevin MacLeod<br/>\n<strong>Writing</strong> - PB&amp;Jelly<br/>\n<strong>Programming</strong> - PB&amp;Jelly<br/>\n<strong>Male Voices</strong> - James Cheek<br/>\n<strong>Female Voices</strong> - Jill Harris\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a3fea0a5776d99a369efd34317bc1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["PB&Jelly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
