And made by a single dude who has no idea what he's doing...<br/></p><p>EPILEPSY WARNING: This game potentially has quite a bit of flashing lights, not much, but it may be an issue if you are subject to photosensitive epilepsy.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>T.E.R.T. is a TETRIS-ish game  I made to train myself and experiment a bit with Godot, while keeping a reasonable scope to, for once, manage to finish it. It has no specific vision, and a lot of things are made at an extremely amateur-ish level, so expect some jank along the way. Feel free to provide feedback and advices, and to let me know if you find any bug :D</p>\n<p>This thing vaguely resembling a game is open-sourced under the MIT license.

If, by any mistake, you wish to dig into the code, beware that this game is the incarnation of \"quick and dirty\", so you may want to protect your eyes on what you are going to see in this spaghetti plate.</p>\n<p>The server hosting the scores can struggle a bit from time to time, so if you can't send your score or cannot load the score board, try to wait a bit. If the issue still persist, please let me know and I'll have a look. Oh, and the browser version is prone to bugs depending on the web browser you are using, sadly I can't do much about it :(<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a41ceaefa3591a3d1b83c5c44eec2d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PangoTango"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
