This project was developed under Code Coven's Summer Program 2021 with Facebook Gaming,\u00a0 an 11-week game development incubator for early career developers of\u00a0marginalized genders.<br/></p>\n<p>During the course of the program, we had to scope down on our original full game idea,\u00a0 and instead submitted a demo of our game concept. We are hoping to continue the game in our free time after the program is over and, once we polish it up to our liking, look for a\u00a0publisher!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Game Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome to Mariposa Valley, a tiny town tucked away between the mountains that no one seems to know about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Parvana is a Mariposa Valley local and aspiring writer, who starts to notice something missing at the general store she works at. Words. Full words gone from people\u2019s minds. At first she blamed it on poor memories, but then it started happening more frequently\u2026 and worse.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Art by Rizz Campanati</p>\n<p>Game Design by Elaine\u00a0Fiandra<br/></p>\n<p>Programming by\u00a0Alina Qureshi</p>\n<p>Narrative Design by Ave Kaye \"Calamity\"</p>\n<p>Menu Music by\u00a0PatrickLieberkind</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7d947b5f952b3a417293759fad1db05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Actually The Moon", "Aliinaa", "rizz campanati", "Mundane Magic", "Calamity"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
