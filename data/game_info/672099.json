The elders of the GameZone deemed it too powerful for feeble human minds of the year\u00a01992, and it only saw a limited release in Japan. So we wondered, what if Lunar Chase had been released? Would we have seen more 3D games on the Game Boy?</p>\n<p>Enter <strong>Space Raiders</strong>, a 3D game for #GBJam9. Shoot everything in sight, try to collect the L power-up for lasers, and see how far you get in this proc-gen space shooter.</p>\n<p><strong>Realistically, could this be on the Game Boy?<br/></strong>Maybe! It uses a lot of the 3D techniques in X, which was a real Game Boy game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What else is constrained?<br/></strong>Simultaneous\u00a0sound effects\u00a0are limited to two at a time, the music and sound effects were made in Deflemask using the Game Boy mode.\u00a0The frame rate and viewport are also limited to give a more Game Boy feel.<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics and Code by Hawken King @hawkun<br/>Audio by Matthew Ivic @matthewaivic</p>\n<p>We made this game in about 4 days, theres loads of things I'd love to add but alas there is fixed time frame for GBJam so,\u00a0it is what it is.
