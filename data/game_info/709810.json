The only other person on the island is a wise old granny named Kloke Gamle. One day you leave your house and find a tower, you ask Kloke about it but she doesn\u2019t know where it came from but there is an ancient structure of untold power. You don\u2019t care about any of that and just want it out of your island. You ask Gram about it but is busy with finding batteries for her blender, so you decide to help her by finding the batteries yourself.You're on an island in the middle of Noware (or was it Norway).
