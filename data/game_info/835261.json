{"id": 835261, "slug": "car-park-madness", "name": "Car Park Madness", "name_original": "Car Park Madness", "description": "<p>The TriJam 181 theme is Storage Management and rather than inventory management or similar other possible designs my mind went to storing cars in a car park under heavy time constraints.</p>\n<p>You are a valet at the big musical event. It's been so busy that a lot of the cars aren't parked yet! When the gates close the concert will start and anyone not in the building will not be allowed entry! It is YOUR responsibility to make sure everyone is parked and seated before the band begins to play.</p><p>Remember to stop the car before you get out or you might not find it where you left it!<br/></p>\r\nWhy This Game?\r\n<p>Why not! I thought a slightly more involved, annoying game would be fun make! I tried to avoid scope creep but there were a lot of things I could have added (had it not been for the 3 hour limit). I would have liked to fix some litttle bugs, add some music and add little NPCs that walked from the cars to the venue. grumbling about almost missing the concert. While I was making the game on stream, chat thought it would be fun to have car alarms go off on impact. This was my one piece of scope creep and it didn't work so I removed it.<br/></p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>To move the valet or car, use WASD or arrow keys.</p>\n<p>E to enter and exit cars!</p>\n<p>Q to start/stop the car engine!</p>\n<p>Shift to sprint (as player)<br/></p>\n<p>Park all the cars before the time runs out! It's tough!</p>\r\nCredits\r\nProgramming/Design\r\n<p>Derwent Ready</p>\r\nAudio SFX\r\n<p>Teifion Powell</p>\n<p>mickthemicguy - CC0<br/></p>\r\nCar/Player Assets\r\n<p>Kenney - CC0<br/></p>\r\nTrailer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T06:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3d5fd78ba9594bcd3e53d285b2d850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
