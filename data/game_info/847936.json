Move to touch the white counter and left click to serve prepared ramen. Move to the blue kitchen counter and press E to start the preparation process, then follow the on-screen instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a small prototype of a small part of the designed game, which is described below.</strong> In the prototype, you can prepare and serve ramen to customers. The customers will stick around for a long time until served; then they'll eat quickly and leave. Their different colors represent a mechanic described below.\u00a0<strong>Feel free to download my personal Game Design Document! :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In Running a Ramen Shop UwU,</strong> you'll start off as the chef, cashier and cleaner of a small ramen shop.\u00a0You'll change the color of your shop often to match as many customers' ramen colors as possible to earn buffs corresponding to the color and the number of soups of that color; it'll be a very cute game (uwu).\u00a0And if you want to hire help, you'll have to spend time advertising...yourself. Over the course of the game, you'll spend more and more of your time managing and upgrading your shop instead of manually serving in it. You'll hire employees to fulfill roles you specify--sometimes customers will apply, but usually you'll buy advertisement! You'll even reap the rewards of particularly\u00a0intersocial customers while kicking out those who are too loud.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T18:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d31b08ba97bbb0ff1470e9e4e043e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thia Broido"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
