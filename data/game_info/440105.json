Easy to learn and fun to play, simply connect two matching tiles that are next to each other, OR around the corner. You have up to 3 lines to make a connection!<br/><br/>Learning to play Infinite Connections is easy. Search through a fun mix of images, find a pair that match, then find a connecting path between the tiles in 3 lines or less. When you make all the tiles disappear, you win the game! Sounds easy, right? Not so fast. When the board shifts, so does your strategy. Did we mention that you have to think fast because you\u2019re racing the clock? <br/><br/>Run out of connections? Use a hint to help you out!<br/>- Use the spyglass to highlight a matching pair to get you through a pinch. <br/>- You can also shuffle the board to shake things up a bit when you run out of options.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-03T17:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e63da26c193f9dee7793bafbe8f9b096.jpg", "website": "http://randomlogicgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Conversion"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Conversion"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
