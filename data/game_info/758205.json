Then border switch back to grey, any its your turn: press the numbers to reproduce the dance. If you failed border will be red, if it was OK, border will switch to green.\r\n If the steps finished the game restarts from training.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you arent familiar with the VideoTON TVC Computers, you are not alone.
