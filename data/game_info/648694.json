You have a unique opportunity to know and feel it. Uncertainty beckons. You can no longer walk, but hope does not allow you to give up and surrender. You keep walking. Salvation is nowhere to be expected. You yourself will have to gnaw your life out of the jaws of death. You are faced with a choice: your fear or the hope of salvation.</p>\n\n\n<p>The atmosphere of the game puts pressure on the psyche. Moving forward into the depths of the fog is dangerous, but if you stand still,  you will face inevitable death. </p>\n<p>The task is to open the entire map, along the way finding weapons\u00a0 that will help from the enemies. It is also necessary to look for generators that will replenish your sanity. When player can defend a fear, he needs to find a way to escape from this cursed island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>WSAD - Move\r\n</p>\n<p>LShift - Sprint\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Interact/Pick Up\r\n</p>\n<p>M - Map\r\n</p>\n<p>N - Note\r\n</p>\n<p>TAB - Close Map/Note\r\n</p>\n<p>LMB - Fire\r\n</p>\n<p>RMB - Scope <br/></p>\n<p>Recommended System Requirements: <br/></p>\n<p>Windows 10(64x only)<br/></p>\n<p>Intel Core i-3 4130\r\n</p>\n<p>GTX 960(2 GB)\r\n</p>\n<p>RAM: 8 GB\r\n</p>\n<p>Storage: 4.5 GB <br/></p>\n<p>Contacts:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>YouTube - https://youtube.com/channel/UCtQzFpUU6Pkf2R84vuUsfjA\r\n</p>\n<p>Discord -\u00a0 https://discord.gg/xH8qNfg | Pinkie's candy#6378<br/></p>\n<p>Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/artemunreal/\r\n</p>\n<p>VK - https://vk.com/id364498047\r\n</p>\n<p>Telegram - @UnrealArtem\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9aba65a172a2d207240cde5cf257b687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unreal Artem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
