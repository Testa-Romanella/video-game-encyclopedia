{"id": 20622, "slug": "lightrise", "name": "Lightrise", "name_original": "Lightrise", "description": "Lightrise is a skill-based, player vs. player combat game which at the core is focused on fun, fluent and fast-paced combat. Lightrise gives players a combat experience not quite like anything else available out there. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLightrise has much more depth than a traditional one-shot, one-kill FPS, but at the same time does not have any of the familiar restraints such as classes, roles and load outs that are typically found in games of the genre today. Right from the start, each player has access to an identical arsenal of spells and skills - the playing field is as even as it could be - no strongest classes, no flavor of the month builds, no over-powered load out configurations. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery player can shoot a bow, cast a fireball or swing an axe seamlessly without any artificial restrictions. Every win and loss will be determined solely by how well you play in that moment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/962/96230381968cbcee863b88e41abe449c.jpg", "website": "http://www.lightrisegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 165, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bulkhead Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bulkhead Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
