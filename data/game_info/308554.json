You play as a slime roaming around a field with a cobble road. Your goal is to read all of the scattered notes and avoid the Fire. Learn more about me, my high school career, and my plans for the future. This game's code, graphics, and animations were all made by me. Some graphics are heavily overhauled versions of other peoples work. The audio is from a free sound effects website. This is my second game I've ever made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50fb9851fe418e9d40cc385cb3077ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheDankZebra"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
