We all dream of sunny beaches and some handsome guy who is drinking cocktail all alone and is attracting you with his nice blue eyes. So, if romance happens, that would be the first thing you would talk on the returning back in September, in high school or in college. Summer relaxes people, no matter where you go, weather on some sunny beach or on some quiet mountain, the body and mind need to go easy and then nice things happen. And, most often, the best holidays are those that we spend with our closest friends, no matter where and no matter if the place is the most exotic one. The party is important and the memories we create together.<br/><br/>Such kind of a character is Megan, our hero of the game for today. She is a romantic kind of woman that lives in her memories. Can you imagine, every summer she remembers one single summer, the one that happened ten years ago, when for the first time she met her actual husband. Since then, the best season for her is the summer. Megan lives in a small town that is abounded with wonderful nature and parks. She spends summer days exactly on those places, where she met her loving man and there she reminds of the wonderful summer of love.<br/><br/>How nice? And her husband is exactly the kind of man she has always dreamt off. The one she imagined when she first saw him on that park in her birth town, he turned out to be even more caring that she could imagine. And the love grows deeper every day, so it is not weird that she couldn't forget that lovely first smile on that sunny day when she met for the first time the lovely smile of her hubby.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7acaa891d0e0e745fac37a637d922ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kong Nai"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Kong Nai"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
