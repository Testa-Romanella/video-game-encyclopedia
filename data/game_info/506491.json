This game jam challenged participants to make a game based on an entry to the 2020 My Famicase Exhibition. These custom famicom (NES)\u00a0cartridges are lovingly crafted every year by designers all over\u00a0the world. The design that we based our game on was this one here, by @wyel. With the permission of the original designer, we started to craft our little game, and what you see before you now\u00a0is the result! We hope you enjoy Postal Training Program, and please let us know your thoughts in the comments below!<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Postal Training Program currently only supports keyboard and mouse controls. Use the mouse in the menus, and the keyboard when in a level. The controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse - Click on menu buttons</li><li>Arrow Keys - Control Futokun's movement</li><li>Shift Key - Hold to run</li><li>Z Button - Pick up / place objects</li></ul>\n<p>The goal is to score as many points as possible by accurately sorting the letters into their respective mailboxes by colour. If a letter enters the correct mailbox, you gain a point, otherwise a point is subtracted. Also, the white letters give you five seconds of bonus time each! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df8de9ba90fc407db051f25da4069432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["yomiparis", "AJ Booker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
