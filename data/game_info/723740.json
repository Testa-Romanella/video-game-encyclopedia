Become a palaeontologist and help Professor Rex assemble a new hadrosaur skeleton for the museum.</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>Fossils are the remains and/or traces of once living things (e.g.,\u00a0bones,\u00a0shells,\u00a0leaves,\u00a0footprints) preserved in stone, which palaeontologists study in order to piece together the story of Life\u2019s past on our planet. By studying and comparing the skeletons of many different animals (both recent and ancient), dinosaur palaeontologists become experts at distinguishing between the many bones of a dinosaur\u2019s body, and the differences that can be seen in these bones between the different families of dinosaurs. Closer inspection, measurement, and comparison against the many specimens found in museum collections enables experts to determine whether a given find is something new to Science.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>Dr. David Evans\u00a0is the Curator of Vertebrate Palaeontology in the\u00a0Centre for Fossils and Evolution\u00a0at the ROM, for whom \u201cduck-billed\u201d dinosaurs (or Hadrosaurs) have\u00a0long been an area of interest. Close comparison\u00a0by Evans and colleagues\u00a0of what were thought to be five different types of duck-billed dinosaurs revealed what were in fact younger and older growth stages of only two different types of\u00a0<em>Edmontosaurus</em>\u00a0(the dinosaur which Professor Rex is trying to assemble).\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a006c8d98058ebceb2cc9eaa3d5de353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
