You are the keeper of a final lighthouse, at Desolation Point, but all hope is not yet lost. There are nine more, interconnected\u00a0lighthouses, and you must strategically link them one-by-one.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A set of AI supervisors manage most of the game, including control of individual entities (which will fight and collect resources on their own). You must strategically make links between lighthouses. Observe the flow of units and send out a repair team when your enemies are distracted and the time is right.</p>\n<p>It is a game of timing, luck and micromanagement, and my personal best score has been to ignite 6/10 lights.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>A Warning</strong></p>\n<p>I made some last minute balance changes that make this game much harder. I do not know if it is possible to beat, and involves a lot of strategizing, luck and time if it is. Make good use of baits, and do not take too long or send excessively large parties, as time is not on your side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anything, this is more of an interesting AI experiment, with a few knobs that you, the player, can twist to affect it. This might make it frustrating and slow paced to some, and I apologize for that.</p>\n<p><em>Background music composed by J.E.\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:54:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/254ec6ba7c24583c40a24b7df12eff63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wintrmut3"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
