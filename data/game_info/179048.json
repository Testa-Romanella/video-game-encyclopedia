Now you can play a western style version of that classic game in your mobile phone!<br/><br/>You can play alone, trying your best to improve your high score. Or you can challenge your friends and play the 2 Player mode. Who will be the fastest shooter in the Kaeltrom's Saloon?<br/><br/>Right now the game is complete, but I'm working on new updates such as translation to other languages (spanish to begin with), ranked ladders and a new enemy. All new ideas and feedback are welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e75068c40240a1debd9766b64542c08d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Kaeltrom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
