This one was to try out different codes for <em>the terror of knowing</em> workshop.</p>\n<p>It's inspired by Tale of Tales, <em>The Path</em>. </p>\n<p>I wanted try to make a branching story with three possible endings. Good, bad, and medium. A couple randomly generated events and to play a bit with the 'live' code to make very simple effects. Also, I tried a variable to remember the player's name.</p>\n<p>I like this idea of making short quick program sketches as practice. Like how in drawing you fill up a sketch book to practice. Well, here I go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b02/b02a77d64ea2b12aa5fd2b46eb59a232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dpoulsen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
