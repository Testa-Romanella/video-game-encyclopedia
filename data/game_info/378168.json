I obviously didn't want to implement linear algebra ops from scratch, when I have libraries that do that faster than I could ever optimize a piece of code... I did implement a quadtree just because I wanted to at the beginning, which in the end proved very helpful together with the collision system.</p>\n<p>This was a blast and I'm looking forward to playing all the games in this contest :)</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>I purposely did not add a bunch of text in the game.
