With the exit 30 steps away, you got up and prepared yourself for the journey ahead...</p>\n<p>===========</p>\n<p>This is the first completed\u00a0game I have ever made using Godot. It is a simple game where you use your mouse and click some buttons to take action. The objective is to simply reach 30 steps without dying against the monsters that you encountered. There will also be random loots that can help you in recovering your health, or\u00a0increasing your stats as you march forward to your 30th steps.\u00a0Hopefully, you guys find this game enjoyable :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T12:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/790/790ea2743440d98210f735a1a2c3324c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Flying Kat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
