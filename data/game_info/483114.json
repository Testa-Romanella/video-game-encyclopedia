Like, it's 2h from the deadline right now, and I'm still making my first build, so, bear with me.</p>\n<p>Ok so now I'm trying a second build because the first one doesn't seem to work in WebGL, maybe a TextureFormat thing, so let's try another format. If it doesn't work, it's just gonna be a Windows build.</p>\n<p>It didn't work, as you may have read already (if really you're reading that ramble?). Also I couldn't really test it extensively, mainly because it's now 2am here. My dog is trying to guilt trip me because she's tired. Ok Rama, fine, we go to bed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:09:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/5320956acfbf8c871eb649ae0755af35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grhyll"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
