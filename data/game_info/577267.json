Quite basic with lots of bugs (ball moves too fast), but is a lot of fun as a proof of concept\r\n</p>\n<p>Chill Frog:\u00a0Quite a cool concept that I could not help but to make a game out of it. Five levels showing different platforming concepts using spinners as controls. Plus you can't help but respect the frog.\r\nLeave me a comment on what you think. Thanks for playing and big thanks for IMS and Wonderville crew for hosting the game jam\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:27:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77a341ed46d414fb0e5c70afd6f81c3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ammar Rica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
