One day, aliens from the planet Idrate launched an invasion against Mac'ynn population. To destroy them, the Idrates poured a dark substance from their planet onto the solar panels used to power the Mac'ynns.  The little cleaning robot C1-34N wakes up from his recharge after the Idrates have sabotaged most of the solar panels. Driven by his sense of duty and his need to clean, he races against time to clear the panels before he runs out of batteries.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Programmers:\u00a0</strong>Michael Silva,\u00a0Claudia Antoun,\u00a0Anthony Chiniara, Emmanuelle Roberge</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:07:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/51641da9bea192100fd230de435349c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["manuerob"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
