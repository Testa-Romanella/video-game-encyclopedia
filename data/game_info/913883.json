Even if something lifts them up they'll\u00a0circle back to loathing if their mindset hasn't improved. So for this game, you're to blast as many negative thoughts as you can and only let in the positive stuff. If you can do that, eventually this pink-haired sad bean will become happy.</p>\r\nSidenote:\u00a0 I know mental health isn't this simple but I had 3 hours to make this thing.\r\nAudio Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Sound Effects from Zapsplat:\u00a0</strong>https://www.zapsplat.com/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music by Eric Matyas:\u00a0</strong>https://soundimage.org/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:30:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bb55e570bba8633081616360a64ba7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
