{"id": 754576, "slug": "cryptbro", "name": "Cryptbro", "name_original": "Cryptbro", "description": "<p>Intended to be satirical in nature, the game is from the perspective of a \"crypto bro\" whos hypocrisies are revealed through dialogue interacting with other users online. After realizing that he had bought in for a much higher price than his friend, he reevaluates his financial decisions by logging off for the day. </p>\n<p>By emulating tech spaces (like a browser, log in and homescreen), the game immerses the player in that environment, with the player avatar represented by a cursor. </p>\n<p>As this is a linear game, I chose dialog options to be the boolean variable on whether or not the player advances to the next scenes. Likewise, I chose shuffling dialog for one of the online users to express the different views commonly seen about NFTs / crypto currency.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7bd5dd5e2d8d3fb62ed20932ea1128e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nasr Bin Safwan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
