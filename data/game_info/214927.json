ADDING PICTURES AND STUFF**</p>\n<p>A game for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018. I fell asleep in the middle of it :)))))))))))).</p>\n<p>Its basically a shoot 'em up but you don't shoot. The only way to beat your enemies is by hitting them and reflecting their bullets back to them. By this you need to activate your especial shields. The game is endless, waves and waves keep coming and it starts to getting harder as the time between waves gets shorter. Also in case you aren't familiar with this kind of games your hitbox is much smaller compared to your sprite.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Movement<br/>Shift: Focus (Slower Movement)<br/>Z or Q: Activate Reflective Shield. While this is activated you reflect enemy bullets. Be careful since you can get hit from the sides and behind. (You can also face hit enemies with this.\u00a0It's not intentional and it's a bug :'( )<br/>X or W: Activate Offesnive Shield. Gives you the ability to move much faster (in both focused and unfocused mode) and two spiky shields to each side of your ship that will allow you to take down enemies hitting them on the sides.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: PLAY IN WINDOWED SINCE I FORGOT TO ADD A LEAVE GAME OPTION BECAUSE TIME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: Jasqui (me)<br/>Pixel Artist: Nes-Arts<br/>Illustrator: Naigart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f594a7bc6aaf01fda8b08836019ee990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasqui", "Nes-arts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
