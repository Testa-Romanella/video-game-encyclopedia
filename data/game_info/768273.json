The theme was Underwater.\u00a0This was my second time participating in a game jam and I was reminded\u00a0how little you can do in a short amount of time. I'm not totally happy with the gameplay aspect of it -- especially since you have the lungs of a god. I am happy with how the story came together though.</p>\n<p>My creative goal was to create something\u00a0visually striking that involves water. My technical goals were to make a game using URP and\u00a0an event based architecture in Unity.</p>\n<p>If you feel inclined to toss any coins my way, rest assured they'll be used to fund future games.\r\n</p>\n<p>To follow along and learn about new games, follow me here on Itch or\u00a0find me at:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffa\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/081/08184b2e5e514de32d000b6f645abad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geoff Alday"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
