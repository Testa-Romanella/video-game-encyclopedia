We developed all assets for this game within the assigned 48-hour time slot over the weekend of January 26th-28th.</p>\n<p>The theme this year was Transmission. We took that primarily as the spread of something from one to another. In our game, you play as the alien virus where you transmit yourself to other organisms and gain control of them. Over time, you become a mob entity and try to take over the President. Infect all of the objectives and survive with at least one person still infected to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>After starting our game at the global game jam, we were chosen to compete further in the Best of Georgia competition and had another 2 weeks to add more to our game. We are happy with what we were able to accomplish (especially because we could handle more characters on phone than we were on the computer initially).</p>\n<p>The game is also available for download on the Google Play store, and we hope to be updating it with further improvements, additions, and fixes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/974/9748bcee238174fdbc17ee4d7246b199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurboDrew17"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
