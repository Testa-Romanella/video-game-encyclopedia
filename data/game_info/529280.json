Remember, if any goody-two-shoes show up to mess with our operation you just gotta use the mouse to shoot em. Maybe even use WASD or the arrow keys to move around if you gotta, or space bar to jump.</p>\n<p>If some of ya's die so be it, but one of you better take them down before they reach the core or this place is going sky high. You better leave the boss music on too, I don't care how long yer shift is, that's my signature thing!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Love, Boss<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>The hero assets are by ManNeko and came from here:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/adventurer-blake-1...</p>\n<p>The goon assets are by Batewar and came from here:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/bodyguards-...</p>\n<p>The gun the player uses is by Nokobot and came from here:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/modern-guns-handgun-129821</p>\n<p>I also used a few animations from this pack by Explosive:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/rpg-character-mecanim-animat...<br/></p>\n<p>The intro-screen song is Hoist by Andy G.
