You were smart and stocked up on candy during a close out sale of a Halloween shop a couple of months back. Inevitably, all the kids will be knocking on your door for some candy. These kids are tired and don't want to wait so long so you'd better give them their candies quick!! Or else they'll drop a complaint and you could potentially lose your title as the <em>best candy provider in the history of all dem neighborhoods\u00a0</em>\"behind you\". This would inevitably have the kids\u00a0never trick or treat with you again... yes a tragic fate for any trick or treaters pro.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Objective</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Give desired \"wish list\"\u00a0candies to the kids before their \"patience timer\" runs out. If you don't fulfill the kids' list, you'll receive complaints. You'll have about 90 seconds to survive the wave. Your neighborhoods complaint threshold is 5.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong></p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Grab / Give Candy</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tools Used</em></strong></p>\n<p>Godot</p>\n<p>Inkscape</p>\n<p>Reaper\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Decent Sampler, LABS, Kontakt Player - Music]</p>\n<p>[Freesound.org for SFX]</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Our team of 3 (artist, programmer, musician) tackled this project!!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Additional Notes</em></strong></p>\n<p>- The game currently on works on PC!
