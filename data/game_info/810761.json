In creating it, my goal was to make a game as close to those original games as possible, with as many interesting and fun twists on those ideas within the original Super Mario Bros limitations. However, the game differs from the original version in many ways. Beautiful graphical assets have been added, new enemy animations, new enemies new obstacles and much more.</em>\n<em>Thanks to Nintendo for the music, sprites and sounds.</em>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\u00a0|\u00a0 WHAT THIS GAME HAS\u00a0 \u00a0|\r\n==========================\r\n-\u00a0 Conroller Available\r\n\r\n-\u00a0 Comfortable Movement\r\n\r\n-\u00a0 Beautiful Pixel Art\r\n\r\n- You Can Kiss Princess !!\u00a0\r\n\r\n-\u00a0 9 Hurdles\r\n\r\n-\u00a0 10 Orginal Enemy\r\n\r\n<em>- High Score System</em>\n<em>- Secrect Rooms</em>\n<em>- High Level Of Difficulty</em>\n<em>- Orginal SoundTrack</em>\n<em>- Orginal Sound Effect</em>\n<em>- Mini Boss</em>\n<em>- Hard Challange Rooms</em>\n<em>- Main Boss Bowser</em>\r\n\r\n===========================\r\n\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n1-\u00a0 \u00a0Un-zip the file.\r\n\r\n2-\u00a0 \u00a0Open \" Super Mario Plumber \"\r\n\r\n3-\u00a0 \u00a0Enjoy", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:48:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/6433df3349482855e966b47446ebaed1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iuno"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
