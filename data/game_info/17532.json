It does a lot of work to keep the game interesting and varied for its players, something very few brawlers manage to pull off effectively.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T23:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/4413b90654e7141ee61589ede3a37201.jpg", "website": "http://www.dustyrevenge.com", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 28, "owned": 416, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 578, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PD Design Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PD Design Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
