Lovely graphics, a nice dedicated theme tune and really easy-yet-intriguing play make this a must have for all quick fix puzzle gamers out there.<br/><br/>www.TouchGen.com - 5/5 Editors Choice, Best of 2009 Finalist!<br/>&amp;quot;one of the best games I&amp;#39;ve played this year.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I think that Super Juicy may just be the Doodle Jump of match-3 games!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>www.appsized.com: <br/> &amp;quot;One. of. my. favorite. games. EVER. It&amp;#39;s bubble <br/>wrap in Technicolor. Yummy graphics and sounds.<br/>Super Juicy should be on the list of the best iPhone/iPod Touch games ever.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>www.appcraver.com (9/10!):<br/>Super Juicy is bringing a new kind of action to the popular genre started by Bejeweled. The point is still to match like objects, but instead of jewels or parrots Super Juicy is all about the bubbles, baby. Moving bubbles that float, squeeze and grow in an ever-changing dance that kept me engaged for all 38 levels.<br/><br/>www.pocketfullofapps.com (OVERALL 10/10!) :<br/>The graphics are fun, and great for all ages. Sound is equally well done, and this game will keep you playing for a long time.<br/><br/><br/>Quotes:<br/>------<br/>&amp;quot;As is, it will probably become one of my showcase apps, with the new update that&amp;#39;s a no brainer.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;See, just looking at screenshots doesn&amp;#39;t do it justice. I was expecting animation of the &amp;quot;falling sprite&amp;quot; kind. This game does NOT do that. The bubbles falling interact with each other in a natural way. The &amp;#39;stickiness&amp;#39; of bubbles can be &amp;#39;felt&amp;#39; via the interaction. They bounce against each other and gravity and other bubbles shape them.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Even if you are a hard core gamer, you should have a place in your heart (and springboard), for this type of nuanced, casual, pick up and play game...&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Fun! Like tetris and bubble wrap got married and had a baby and called it super juicy!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Fun game. Quite enjoyed it.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;One of the more creative match 3 games, that anyone can appreciate.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;This is game very intense and fun. I love it one of my favorite new games!.... Very Polished and good concept&amp;quot;<br/><br/><br/>Description<br/>---------<br/>5 Game Modes!  Bluetooth and Wifi Multiplayer!  39 Levels!
