Our goal with this project is to create a game that helps relieve the stress or hassle of a hard day's work or even depression with simple yet fun gameplay with interesting and engaging visuals. To achieve this, the game is based on the fundamentals of a casual game of destroying objects before the other competitors and winning the game, resulting in a fast and fun casual multiplayer video game. The protagonists of the game are two robots, called Chunks and Bits, who play in a recycling dump, breaking things made of cardboard, wood or metal. The two robots are in a competition of who can break things faster to win the game, in true television competition style. In addition, the game itself teaches the player the importance of recycling correctly and can contribute to cleaning the environment. With no age limit, the game can be played with friends, family, or even random players.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Controls:<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Movement<br/></em></p>\n<p>\u2191 - Up</p>\n<p>\u2193 - Down</p>\n<p>\u2192 - Right</p>\n<p>\u2190 - Left</p>\n\n<p>F - Punch</p>\n\n\n\n<em>\n<p>If you reach 450 points you win the match or you drop the other player out of their platforms.<br/><br/>It can only be playable for two players at the moment.</p>\n<p>Download link:<br/></p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhA5vBSp1ovPhdExBe_phzpyPGktRNLj/view?usp=sharing</p>\n<p><br/>Meet the Team:</p>\n<p>- David Larco (Developer)</p>\n<p>- Isaac Capillo (Art - Design)</p>\n<p>- Sebastian Calderon (Character Design)</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c150010ca9107de77202b80368dd8e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Team Kero"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
