Move multiple times across the board,\u00a0 attack multiple enemies, at once, endlessly upgrade themselves, you name it! However, there\u00b4s but one resource that limits their potential : your own control over them.</p>\n<p>In this far, far future, you\u00b4re commanding the units from very very far away, so you have a very limited of communication with these units;\u00a0 a limited amount of orders you can send to them.\u00a0And, if you don\u00b4t mantain communication with a given unit, then the very\u00a0CONTROL you have over them will fade away, leaving them open to be STOLEN by an enemy with sufficient control.</p>\n<p>As such, CONTROL is your single most important resource, which you can use to do basically anything you want, but it\u00b4s so important, that you may have have to make certain strategic sacrifices. For instance, if you\u00b4re just one attack away from flanking and killing an important strategic objective, but have just 1 CONTROL left,\u00a0then you may have to choose between using\u00a0 that last resource to kill the objective while leaving a\u00a0 powerful unit uncontrolled and vulnerable to being stolen, or maintaining that unit and delaying the attack, thus losing you\u00a0 valueable momentum.</p>\n<p>While the game does have a tutorial, here are all the actions you can perform:</p>\n<p>-&gt; Maintaining communication with your units, thus keeping them on your side.</p>\n<p>&gt;Stealing an uncontrolled unit from your enemy</p>\n<p>-&gt;Moving your units</p>\n<p>-&gt;Attack ingwith your units</p>\n<p>-&gt;Build a new unit, which may be of 3 types:</p>\n<p>.Jets, which though weak, are perfect for sneaking behind enemy lines and stealing units.</p>\n<p>.Tanks, which offer pure firepower at the cost of speed.</p>\n<p>.Forts, which are brilliant on the deffense.</p>\n<p>-&gt;Upgradeing a unit</p>\n<p>-&gt;Build a radio tower, which grants you +1 control per turn, but may be easily captured by an enemy.</p>\n<p>-&gt; Upgrade a radio tower/your HQ, powering their defenses\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goal: Using your CONTROL to destroy the enemy\u00b4s HQ;</p>\n\n<p>Music Credits:\u00a0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</p>\n<p>*Tip: Press A in the main menu for a quick game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T04:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec9da8e8ab5823621a62c2125890e3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Doc Cyan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
