It also has actual enemies that don't just randomly spawn, but move using the A* algorithm, FOV, and a broken\u00a0stat system,\u00a0much like classic roguelikes, courtesy again of \u00a0the ROT.js library. Movement is super fast compared to Twine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:39:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cdf2d865dabac92df1d300b8d5b6e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicholas Foo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
