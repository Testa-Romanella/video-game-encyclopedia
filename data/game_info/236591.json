The boogie meter fills when Bot-Tom runs to the right or drains when he stands still. Use this boogie energy for special abilities like slow motion, wave-dash and healing. With a 100% charge the player can unleash the super boogie, going invincible\u00a0 while Bot-Tom\u2019s speed increases. Bot-Tom can also use wave jets, which converts battery life into upward momentum. Many of Bot-Toms abilities shoot sound waves that can harm enemies above, below or behind him.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Gamepad controls are viewable at any time in the pause menu.
