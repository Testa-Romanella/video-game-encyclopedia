How? By taking their place instead!</p>\n\n<p>These terrorists won't just leave them alone when someone attempts to rescue their hostages. Run into their bullets to save the lives of those poor people and become a (short lived) hero! But you must get shot by all of them, or at least one of them will die.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong>\u00a0<em>This was my first Ludum Dare. Oddly enough, I am actually managing to make a finished product within less than the given span time of even the Compo! Which, honestly, quite surprised me. I'd like to thank the person I first saw do Ludum Dare, Shaun Spalding or @shaunjs, for introducing it to me indirectly. Without this, I'd never have made as good of a game as I did these couple of days.</em> :sunglasses:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d5048cd1917f343e332385d2050e570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supergamersgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
