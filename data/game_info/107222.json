{"id": 107222, "slug": "vendetta-online-itch", "name": "Vendetta Online (itch)", "name_original": "Vendetta Online (itch)", "description": "<p>\n<strong><em>Vendetta Online</em> is an indie 3D space-combat MMORPG</strong> for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS, as well as the Oculus Rift, Gear VR and Daydream VR. This MMO permits thousands of players to interact as the pilots of spaceships in a vast universe.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Users may build their characters in any direction</strong> they desire, becoming rich captains of industry, military heroes, or outlaws.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A fast-paced, realtime \"twitch\" style combat model, with newtonian physics,</strong> gives intense action, coupled with the backdrop of RPG gameplay in a massive online galaxy.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The special Itch.io price point includes a unique \"Lite Subscription\"</strong> key good for 6 months of play on the PC, and can be applied to a new or existing account on our website. 20% of your purchase price goes back to supporing Itch.io!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Capital ships may be manufactured, Stations conquered.</strong> Player created content is also present, in the form of canonical story-driven missions submitted by our Player Contribution Corps.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Three major player factions</strong> form a delicate balance of power, with several NPC sub-factions creating situations of economic struggle, political intrigue and conflict.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The game offers a single persistent galaxy for all platforms,</strong> and players may transition between platforms and device types seamlessly.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A complex and nuanced backstory</strong> adds to the depth of immersion, resulting in a unique online experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>This unique MMO has been created</strong> and constantly evolved by <em>Guild Software</em>, a tiny company of only four people, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The game has been live online since early 2002. Despite the age of the title, all engine technology is developed in-house, and has been constantly upgraded over the years, so a modern GPU is recommended for the best visuals, especially for VR (the attached YouTube trailer is several years old, and a bit graphically out of date).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>An active relationship between the developers</strong> and the player-base is maintained on our forums, and the game is patched with updates roughly every week or two.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Business Models</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile is Free To Play:</strong> this means Android, iOS, Amazon, Gear VR and Daydream, on tablet, phone or AndroidTV. There is no time limit on playing, but there are micro-transactions for the secondary currency, which can also be earned through gameplay activity. There is currently a level cap for \"F2P\", although our game is driven far more by player-skill than \"character level\", and much of the best equipment is available under the cap.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\"Lite Subscription\" ($1/month)</strong> allows <em>\"Free to Play\"</em> style gaming on PC, (albeit, obviously not entirely for free). Usually, the Lite Subscription must be purchased In Game on an actual mobile device (Android, Amazon, iOS), but in this case the Itch.io price includes 6-months of \"Lite\" mode, applicable to any account (new or existing) and usable on any combination of platforms. 20% of the purchase price goes back to supporting Itch.io.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\"Premium Subscription\" ($10/month)</strong> allows play on PC, or any platform, without ever having to worry about secondary \"crystal\" currency again, and also opens up some end-game content, like manufacturing your own capital ships.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eventually,</em> we intend to have a simpler hybrid business mode, with F2P and subscriptions available across all platforms. The current confusing situation stems from a small indie company trying to carefully endure a major change in models, while staying in business.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Game is rated \"T for Teen\" by the ESRB.</strong> Online content may vary.\r\n</p>\n<strong>System Requirements</strong>\n<p>\r\n\tWindows Minimum System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7</li>\n<li>2ghz Processor: Core i-series, Phenom, Pentium4, Althon64, Atom, etc (SSE2 required, recent quad-core recommended)</li>\n<li>1GB of RAM</li>\n<li>GPU: DirectX 9.0c hardware or better (recommended: discrete DirectX 11.2 compliant NVIDIA or AMD GPU with 1GB+ of ram), latest drivers.</li>\n<li>Sound Card</li>\n<li>Keyboard/Mouse</li>\n<li>800MB of uncompressed harddrive space </li>\n<li>56k internet connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tMac Minimum System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacOS X 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\" or newer</li>\n<li>Any Intel Mac</li>\n<li>1GB of RAM</li><li>GPU with OpenGL 4.x compliance (discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU recommended)</li>\n<li>Keyboard/Mouse</li>\n<li>800MB of harddrive space </li>\n<li>56k internet connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tLinux Minimum System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glibc 2.2 or better</li>\n<li>GTK+ 2.0</li>\n<li>1ghz Pentium III or Athlon processor (2ghz+ strongly recommended)</li>\n<li>1GB of RAM</li>\n<li>3D Hardware Accelerator - Fully OpenGL 2.x compatible 32MB videocard with Hardware Transformation &amp; Lighting (T&amp;L), and latest drivers</li>\n<li>Discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU with gl_arb_es2_compatibility extension recommended</li>\n<li>ALSA or OSS-compatible soundcard </li>\n<li>Keyboard/Mouse</li>\n<li>800MB of harddrive space </li>\n<li>56k internet connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tAndroid Minimum System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Android 4.4 or better</li>\n<li>1ghz ARMv7 or Intel SoC</li>\n<li>1GB of RAM</li>\n<li>Touchscreen (AndroidTV, gamepad or keyboard also supported)</li>\n<li>OpenGL ES 2.0 compliant GPU (NVIDIA Tegra, PowerVR or Qualcomm Adreno preferred)</li>\n<li>500MB of available flash storage space</li>\n<li>Reliable internet connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tiOS Minimum System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone or iPad with iOS 10 or better.</li>\n<li>500MB of available flash storage space</li>\n<li>Reliable internet connectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tGear VR Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S6, S6e, S7, S7e, S8, Note 5, or newer.</li>\n<li>The S4 is NOT supported.</li>\n<li>A bluetooth gamepad (SteelSeries, Moga, Nyko, Razer) is highly recommended.</li>\n<li>Headphones or a headset if possible (voicechat, voice command support, speech-to-text, etc).</li>\n<li>500MB of storage space.</li>\n<li>Internet connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tDaydream VR requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully Daydream compatible headset, controller, 500MB of available storage, an internet connection.</li><li>Daydream support requires the \"Vendetta Online HD\" version from the Play Store; this is separate from the regular Android version, as the HD version requires much more recent device hardware, and offers higher-quality textures and other features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\t\tOculus Rift Recommended System Requirements:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 7 or newer</li>\n<li>Oculus Rift with retail SDK support and Consumer Edition hardware.</li>\n<li>The fastest possible desktop CPU: Newer Core i7+.
