Farms require water which is provided by rivers. Rivers are replenished by raining events which provide additional water.</p><p>The Entity represented by crosshair can gather water resource from rivers and crop resource from farms but it can only hold one resource at a time. Before it can gather different resource it must deliver the one it carries to the location that needs it. Any surplus resource delivered is wasted in the process.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>SPACE - Select items in menu<br/>LEFT/RIGHT - Rotate the world<br/>UP - Gather resources<br/>DOWN - Deliver resources<br/>ESC - Exit current game, exit from How To screen</p><p><strong>Special thanks</strong><br/></p><p>Katka - for SeaShellz logo design</p><p><strong>Sound and music credits</strong><br/></p><p>Theme music:<br/>Alexander Ehlers (https://opengameart.org/users/tricksntraps)</p><p>Sound effects:<br/>Secretlondon (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Secretlondon)<br/>Arthur (https://opengameart.org/users/arthur)<br/>Tim Mortimer (http://www.archive.org/details/TimMortimer)<br/>Michel Baradari (http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_th...)<br/>JohnsonBrandEditing (http://freesound.org/people/JohnsonBrandEditing/so...)<br/>Blender Foundation (https://apricot.blender.org/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f388b45c508c23766219945a709a45be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cvetk0"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
