You do that by walking to diffrent rooms and find some keys to the next room. It sould not be to\u00a0confusing to navigate because you have a map that helps you. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>This is my first released game and was made for the Vimjam. The game was programmed in python - pygame and was about 1800 lines of code.\u00a0The sfx was also from me in sfxr. The music was made by Alexander Beskow. I also used a tile set by\u00a0Pixel Poem from itch.io and buttons by GameSupplyGuy from itch.io\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There might be some problems with the exe. If you have the problems you can eather just remove the game or if you want to you can copy the code and the data into python. If you do that dont forget to add the library pygame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf89c08c6e8e1fd4e540c554aa9d058a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Tebbe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
