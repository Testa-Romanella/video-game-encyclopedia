You don't know what happened or if who's behind it. Your only guide is a diary left found by another person. Without seeing each other you have to trust the other person to decipher the diary and give you clues. In seven minutes, you need to find the way out or find out the bad thing that will happen to you. Played by two players, the game relies on proper communication. One controlling the the character, while the other reads the Diary to guide the first one. The information written in the diary must be understood by the Diary Reader and transferred properly to the Character Controller.</p>\n\n<p>GameJam link:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/gleam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/326b3b336c158b934f326c972a37f409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Benjamin B.
