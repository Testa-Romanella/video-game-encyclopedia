I had about 3 days to make it.</p>\n<p><strong>The Game\u00a0Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In phase one you play a dog which wants to build up some villages. But therefor you need stones. So you will rob them from the cats in order to achieve two goals:</p>\n<ul><li>Preventing the cats from building up their sphinx\u00a0</li><li>Building up your villages</li></ul>\n<p>Now before the cat lovers start putting hate on me - there is also a phase 2. In this one you play a cat which has to build the sphinx. But be aware:\u00a0it is night and now there are a lot of dogs around which want to prevent you from building up the sphinx. You have to go to the pyramid in order to get stones. Now try to go back to your sphinx with the stones. If the dogs see you then you have a small chance to run away from them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0tallbeard\u00a0who allowed me to use his awesome\u00a0music-loop-bundle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:35:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18ec54a1f8d86333d9c42e432a1a044b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
