Now working on porting it to mobile and adding a tutorial :) \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>A simple physical simulation. You are in a space habitat. Your habitat rotates to provide artificial gravity. But is it really the same gravity? Throw balls in different directions and different positions to find out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created using Godot Engine.
