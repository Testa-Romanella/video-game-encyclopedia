You have an autopilot - at the cost of extra fuel, this autopilot will self-correct and land for you, though don't do it too close to the ground as you WILL crash.<br/>2. Your score directly influences the amount of fuel you have to work with. Don't crash too often, as it\u00a0<strong>will</strong> influence your score.<br/><br/>The music is an old piece of mine! It is actually available to purchase over on my Bandcamp:\u00a0https://peeftubemusic.bandcamp.com/track/constructive-ambiance<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c712472b07135afcf3252528ed89d89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jeremy Peifer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
