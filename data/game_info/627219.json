(Deluxe version)", "description": "<p><strong>Shoaly You Can't Be Serious!</strong> started life as a gamejam entry (available for free <strong>here</strong>) and was developed into a more complete game, with extra music tracks and SFX added, but more importantly lots of flexibility in how the game plays (difficulty - as in the number of sharks / nets / electric eels you face) and fish density (how quickly the fish populate) were incorporated. There is also an endless mode, the chance to just chill out and watch a virtual aquarium, and an extra enemy to deal with (jellyfish).</p>\n<p>It's designed to be a challenging yet relaxing game - so while you will need quick reflexes, the two-player game gives you a combined score, if you want bragging rights that's up to you but the game doesn't assign a winner and loser! Part of the reason for this is that my youngest daughter was my chief play-tester. ;)<br/></p>\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots the game area can be quite serene or completely manic, it's completely up to you!</p><p>Thanks to <strong>Aruma Studios</strong> for Linux repackaging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:39:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ca/6caa559600576fcd3c1b4d43d045c2f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CaptainD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
