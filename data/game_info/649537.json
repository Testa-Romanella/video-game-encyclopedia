This version is closest to the ZX81 version, but adds features such as sound and pause from the ZX Spectrum version.</p>\n<p>It will run on most Commodore PETs (other than the 2001 with the built in datasette) and Mini PETs. It needs 32K\u00a0of RAM, BASIC 4.0 and runs on a 40 column screen.</p>\n<p>Physical copies on cassette are also available from :</p>\n<p>https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/cas024.html</p>\n<p>Video courtesy of Rod Hull from tfw8b.com\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Game Description</strong></p>\n<p>It is coming to the end of 1921's digging season in Egypt. Your excavations have not gone so well this year, failing to find any trace of the legendary and as yet undiscovered Pharaoh's tomb. Then in your final weeks, wild stories recounting the wrath of vengeful mummies strangling would-be tomb local raiders filter back to base camp.</p>\n<p>At last some concrete leads worth looking into, and opportunities too good to pass up. Occultist tales of curses be dammed, you're an Egyptologist and grand adventurer, such nonsense can't possibly hurt you. Or can it?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>\n<p>Tut-Tut is one part puzzle, two parts arcade action. The game is comprised of 28 levels, plus a hidden treasure chamber which may only be opened if you are deemed worthy.</p>\n<p>Collect gems, amulets and bracelets for points, you'll need 5000 before the end of \"Sutekh's Eye\" (level 28) for the treasure chamber to open. Amulets and Bracelets will freeze the player or halt mummies respectively.</p>\n<p>To complete each level the player will need to collect keys, open doors, move blocks before finding exits to lower crypt levels. Keep an eye out for the Pharaoh's roaming guardians, they're not the smartest of the undead but they are relentless.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Keys</strong></p>\n<ul><li>LEFT: 'O' or '4'\u00a0</li><li>RIGHT: 'P' or '6'</li><li>UP: 'Q' or '8'</li><li>DOWN 'A' or '2'</li><li>'R' will reset the level (at a cost).</li><li>'W' will pause the level so you can make a cup of tea, press any key to unpause.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T05:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1b88d92eef5c05fec4c9fc5c5ee6f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tynemouth Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
