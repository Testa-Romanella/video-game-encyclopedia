We lose ourselves to negative thoughts and are only reminded of our shortcomings. It's hard to shake off the dark cloud that's hanging over your head but in time, things start to clear up and you start to feel more like yourself again. Don't let the negativity get to you, just remember to love yourself and be patient.</em></p>\n<p>You've Got Mail is a short game that explores the feeling of losing yourself, self doubt, self hatred and also self love and acceptance. Navigate your way through the dark thoughts while trying to pick yourself up with the love letters addressed to you.
