A charging beast might bash\u00a0into some crates, taking damage. Or a hostile\u00a0machine might get taken out by a ricocheting volley of its own bullets.</p>\n<p>As Worm gets more allies, they might even be able to manipulate the environment to further hinder their foes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I play it?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Garbageland is still in very early\u00a0development, but there's a concept stage you can play around with below! I also plan to\u00a0post regular devlogs featuring screenshots, clips, and maybe even more playable tidbits as I work on the game. Follow along why don't you!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Concept Stage Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move.\u00a0That's it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ffc45d21197eac832642f6706830f43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Ilitchev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
