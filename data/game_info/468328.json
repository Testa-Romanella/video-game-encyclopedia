{"id": 468328, "slug": "out-of-control-game-of-life", "name": "Out of Control Game of Life", "name_original": "Out of Control Game of Life", "description": "<p>John Horton Conway devised a cellular automaton in 1970 known as the Game of Life to determine if a machine could make copies of itself. Over many years, many mathematicians have made complicated seeds within the rules of Life that result in still beings, spaceships, and beings that can repeatedly manufacture similar machines. More information about the Game of Life can be found here.</p>\n<p>To play, simply click on any cells in the green zone to mark them as alive and press space to start the simulation. There are a limited number of starting cells that can be alive so make sure to stay within the limit. If life stagnates or doesn't reach the red zone, right click to restart the room. When any life exists in the red zone, you will progress to the next room. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Press 'S' at the start to enter sandbox mode and play with the original game. If you're stuck there are some important machines that take up very little space that can accomplish a lot. <strong><em>Gliders and Lightweight Spaceships are very useful in traversing space</em></strong>. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681e381e6c302984d39a8e791d14a9a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhostTheBoo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
