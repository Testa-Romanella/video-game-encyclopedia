The Octopus holds 6 features in her mighty tentacles. Roll the dice and a feature is chosen!<br/> <br/>The Dolphin Dice Feature. <br/> The Dolphin Dice screen appears with Spins on the left and Multiplier on the right. The Octopus allows you to roll a dice to increase either spins or multiplier for the free games. During the Dolphin Dice free games special dice appear on reels 2, 3 and 4. These dice are wildcards and also increase your multiplier on winning paylines only! <br/><br/>The Golden Chest Feature.<br/>The Golden Chest screen appears with 10 underwater treasure chests. The Octopus allows you to select either 3 or 6 chests. In each chest are either 3, 7 or 10 free games. The free games wins are all paid at triple normal pays.<br/>During the free games a new Golden Chest symbol is added to reels 1, 3 and 5. Each time a Golden Chest appears the free games multiplier increases by 1 and all Dolphin Wildcards on screen lock in place until the next spin in which no Golden Chests appear. There is no maximum multiplier! If no Golden Chests appear in a spin then all wildcards unlock and the multiplier returns to 3.<br/><br/>The Wild Dolphin Feature.<br/><br/>Never seen a dolphin in a tuxedo? You have now, and he is wild and triples your wins! You'll be swimming in cash! The Wild Dolphin Feature awards 20 free games with all wins tripled.<br/><br/>Every 5 free games played one additional Wildcard Dolphin is added to each reels AND the lowest paying symbol is removed from the reels. A maximum of 5 Tuxedo Dolphins per reel can be awarded. Once all 9, 10, J, Q, K, A symbols have been removed from the reels no further symbols are removed. <br/><br/>The Crab Jackpot - win up to 750,000 virtual dollars!<br/><br/>The Octopus can award the crab jackpot - and you can also win it during free games when 3 gold crab symbols appear.<br/><br/>Open any 6 crab traps to reveal 2, 3 or 4 crabs inside. You need 10 crabs to fill each crab-o-tron. If you fill both crab-o-trons you win the jackpot! If you don't fill both crab-o-trons you win a consolation prize per crab found. <br/><br/>This game is for entertainment purposes only. No real money can be won or lost. <br/><br/>The odds of winning in this simulation are not the same as in real slot machines. Real slot machines are designed to make you consistently lose.<br/><br/>You must be aged 18 (or 21 in some areas) to gamble. <br/><br/>Pokie Magic supports responsible gambling and appropriate parental supervision.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cb/0cb9e8a15d98bedd57325f12ca41c018.jpg", "website": "http://facebook.com/pokiemagic", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["616 Digital"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["616 Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
