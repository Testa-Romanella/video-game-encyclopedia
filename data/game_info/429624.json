A preliminary investigation found that the sounds were coming from the Conde residence, just north of the\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Neighbours have also reported that, in some nights, a telephone keeps ringing incessantly. We have attempted to phone the house, but it seems like the number was changed without any of the city authorities being notified.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>We need you to try and contact Mrs. Conde to see about these disturbances in person; also check on her wellbeing in general, and do a thorough investigation of the house.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>design + programming by Gukajogu<br/>art by Quina Barreto</p>\n<p><em>This is a work in progress.
