Then this is the best way to waste your time!\r\n</p>\n<p>A simple and small game to waste your time, where you jump and shoot enemies. Defeat enemies, bosses, dodge projectiles and upgrade some skills for longer duration with slightly increased spawn rate.\r\n</p>\n<p>It is my first project and I built it using a pygame library for <strong>windows OS </strong>only\r\n</p>\n<p>Built it with a<strong> windows 10 64bit</strong> architecture, so other windows version might have issue launching this game. But I'll add another file where it can run windows 7 32 bit version.\r\n</p>\n<p>It has a fixed screen size with <strong>900 x 521 pixels</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSome controls:\r\n\r\n<p>O - to shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - to jump\r\n</p>\n<p>A and D - to move (only for boss fight)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Its possible to change difficulty levels depending to your preferences\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThank you for the blessings:\u00a0\r\nBackgrounds:\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eder Muniz\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Olga's Lab\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 saukgp<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ansimuz\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Free and Premium Game Assets (GUI, Sprite, Tilesets) - Craftpix.net\u00a0</p>\r\n Sprites animation:\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0aamatniekss\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ansimuz\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 LuizMelo\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Rentro_Ghost\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p>I started this as my first simple game project for my resume and had no idea of programming at that time.
