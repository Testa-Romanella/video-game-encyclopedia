There <em>is </em>no chapter zero! =P<br/>The game exits when you choose 'start' from the menu; since there is no chapter zero, it was in fact technically true when I said you could play through the whole chapter zero. ;P</p><p>Though maybe we'll do a prologue demo. For real. =3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/001fac05fd19bdb56b385a0675edfe89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheDanaAddams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
