Some people see black &amp; white as limitations to creativity. We see them as boundaries to break.<br/><br/>From times, you might even realize that constraints might actually be your guide to appreciating the beauty of a particular perspective.<br/><br/>For instance, if your see the nature closely in black &amp; white, you might see living treasures like the Giant Pandas, White Bengal Tigers &amp; the Snow Leopard.  Even we human cannot deny we are somehow more attracted to the black &amp; white livings.
