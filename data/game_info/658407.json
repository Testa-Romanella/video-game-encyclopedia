Chocolate is a yummy treat. Oh and you can get betrayed by doors. It's free with possible donations so, what can you lose? It's short so you won't lose time. I might add more stuff in updates. This is my first 'finished' game so that's always amazing. Made only using Bitsy (www.Bitsy.com) but nowhere near reaching the full potential of it.\u00a0Don't trust game developers in updating their games, Don't trust doors and Don't trust Chocolate Co.<br/></p>\n<p>OLD too-long short description:<br/></p>\n<p>Made with www.Bitsy.org, this game was created for a game jam. You follow one short linear path, like a little treat. Maybe it'll be updated, maybe it won't. This teaches you three life lessons: Don't trust game developers, Don't trust doors and Don't trust Chocolate Co.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:01:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fec/fec594142f4da2a20887ec6af3ea2f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SquirrelTeam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
