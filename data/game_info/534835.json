What could go wrong? The answer is; EVERYTHING! This utopia of a journey did not last forever. Take necessities such as food from the\u00a0human kind and be welcomed by a raging plague rifling through\u00a0the ship for filling\u00a0their stomachs. Unfortunately, a nice little raccoon is the only thing left before turning to cannibalism. But you, the raccoon, need to escape. Choose the right path in order to survive and maybe help a friend out!</p>\n<p>Be brave and try hard!</p>\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong><br/>Benjamin Hanussek<br/>Pulkit Parashar<br/>Marie Biedermann<br/>Tom Tucek</p><p><strong>Source on GitHub:</strong><br/>https://github.com/pulkitparashar7/GSEGameJam<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baa/baa15cc0c5517ab6d363454c86102522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YenRye", "mcten", "pulkitparashar7", "vulvarine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
