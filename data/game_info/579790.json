Theme: Lost &amp; Found. You are lost in space and must find three key cards to get it working to get yourself home. Some keys are hidden behind puzzles where you must solve in order to progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We developed and tested this on an HTC Vive, allegedly this should work on other VR headsets but we are not able to test this for sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The....everything can use a little work, we know. There are plans to keep working on this but not anytime soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no title screen or end screen. The game starts and the game ends when you get the Thank You message. You must Alt+F4 to close the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The magnet wall behind you is a sort of inventory to keep track of items when you find them. Since there is not a lot of items to keep track of, there is no real purpose to it yet. Feel free to throw the cylinder object at it and watch it stick to it, it's fun I promise.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Sean Maguire</p>\n<p>Stephen Lane</p>\n<p>Sean Thompson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/65608ca4ac461e564930826d3806ad77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Maguire"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
