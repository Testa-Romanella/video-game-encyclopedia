You play as a tank, and blast your way through 50 levels with 10 unique bosses. This was the first game I released on January 19, 2005.<br/><br/><strong>Soldier</strong> is a 2d top-down game where you try to capture the enemy's flag without getting shot down. This was an earlier game from 2004, which I released in March 2005.<br/><br/><strong>Alteration </strong>is a \"Jumper clone\" with an elemental component. This demo is from March 2005 and only contains the tutorial level and first area. I lost the source codes to all these games after a thunderstorm that March.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alteration is by far the hardest of the three games. Soldier is probably the easiest. Amusingly, Soldier uses the same music as Battleground Zero. BGZ is the largest, and also has the most secrets - if you find all five hidden levels you can access a secret boss. <br/><br/>While I worked on several other projects in the 2000s (mainly point-and-click adventure games), I didn't release another game until A Starspangled Zephyr five years later, on April 5, 2010.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Note:\u00a0These are my three oldest games from 2004-2005. You may need to run them in Windows XP compatibility mode.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:13:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b121efe04eccaa792c823a89826d6c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dylan Cassidy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
