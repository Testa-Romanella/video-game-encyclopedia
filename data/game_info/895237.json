This game endlessly runs until an obstacle is hit then the player dies. The goal of this game is to get the best score in reaching further and further. With this comes the factor that the game gets faster as u go, as well as the obstacle, and involves many things like the themed music, style, and ideas.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong> All the things you see here are from the web and from tutorials online in the course to create this game.
