{"id": 450029, "slug": "the-fall-of-uriel-beta-test", "name": "The Fall of Uriel Beta test", "name_original": "The Fall of Uriel Beta test", "description": "<p>This is a development test game for you to have fun while I develop the technologies that will be required for CodeStory.<br/><br/>The Fall of Uriel is the first game developed in my special game engine, an engine with properties no available engine has. This engine allows interaction between different processes and is now able to create windows with arbitrary shape. So let's get to it and gamify the experience!<br/>I really hope you have fun with it and can make pretty images with the gameplay, some levels have been provided with a huge chunk of ink for you.<br/><br/>In The Fall of Uriel, you can ALTernate between being INSIDE and OUTSIDE of the game! You can also SHIFT between realms and CONTROL where you are.\u00a0 <br/>When OUTSIDE, you can avoid every trap you find in your way, but beware! Being OUTSIDE of a game makes you be recognized as a virus, so anti-viruses will attack you and put you back INSIDE.<br/><br/>You can also DRAW YOUR OWN SCREEN! Left mouse click to draw, Right mouse click to erase! Beware, you have a limited area to work with on each level, so you might need to erase your screen to get more. Erasing where you stand might make you go OUTSIDE.<br/><br/>The plot is currently incomplete, Uriel will find his way, but he may change during his journey more than he expects to.<br/><br/>Updates:<br/>-Currently has only 7 levels, comment on objects ideas to add inside levels.<br/>-Passing level 7 returns to level 1. Yea, sorry, no ending yet.<br/>-In need for artists and musicians interested in helping.<br/>-Show it to other people, thank you<br/>-Have fun!<br/><br/>WARNING: There is currently a huge bug when Uriel leaves the game region (by going close to left and up sides of the screen, or by going reeeeealy far to the right or down). This bug breaks the game, making it stop updating (and therefore, can't be closed by pressing X), and I should have fixed the ways that actually bring Uriel to the broken state, but I placed a timer that closes the game when it stops responding for too long (I hope it only kills the game when it stops responding, but no false positive so far during tests). This bug seems to only affect Uriel, doesn't affect spikes, windows, trophies or walls, which is actually what is so weird to me.<br/>Due to the bug, do not use resolutions higher than 1576:1032 for this game, on either coordinates! That's the current game region. People with higher resolutions will have their own game region in the future, but the bigger it is, the laggier the game gets.<br/>(1500:1000 is ok, 300:1200 is not, 1580:200 is not). I use 1366x768 with no problems.<br/>Do NOT execute Body.exe! Unlike CodeStory's, it is NOT protected!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77c0af748dfd623e9d47672838e4e0ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dupletor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
