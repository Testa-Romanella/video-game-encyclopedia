In search for the strongest warriors, Ayziz uses his dark and potent powers to create a multi-universe portal to teleport millions of warriors from different timelines and places around the universe. Arriving near butt-naked through the portal, with only a crusty cloth to cover their shame, the warriors are manipulated to believe that in order to get back to their homeland they must fight their way through blood, guts and glory. <br/><br/>Once, you were a great chieftain! You ruled with honor and justice. All that has changed when the dark portal appeared over the sky and sucked you into the \"IndieKingdom\". Now, you must win your freedom back by rising above all other warriors! <br/><br/>Will you be able to get back to your own time, your own home? Will you be merciful, or will you be vengeful, during your journey? Will you be able to wash your soiled loin cloth? What will remain of your home? Can Ayziz even be stopped? And why are we asking you so many questions?!<br/><br/>Find out in \u201cWarriors: Rise to Glory!\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e4/8e46a7673aa2db3aefe1efb4517ff3bb.jpg", "website": "http://www.warriorsrtg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 34, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gavra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gavra Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
