On the enemy phase, all enemies will step closer to the crystal you need to defend. In between those phases, you have as much time as you like to build and demolish towers (select a tower from the panel and then click on the grid to place) to prepare your defenses for the next enemy phase.</p>\n<p>If too many enemies reach the crystal, it's game over! For an extra challenge, try not letting even a single enemy reach the crystal.</p>\n<p>I've made all 4 levels unlocked from the start so that you don't have to play through them all in one sitting reach level 4, but I definitely recommend that you play through the levels in order.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty small game, and I've got no active\u00a0plans to add more levels at the moment.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Camera Movement - WSAD, or arrow keys</p>\n<p>Camera Rotate - E, Q</p>\n<p>Camera Zoom - R, F</p>\n<p>Pause - Esc</p>\n<p>Everything Else - Mouse</p>\r\nFeedback and Bug Reports\r\n<p>All feedback gratefully received, either in the comments, or to quadpoptowers@gmail.com</p>\n<p>For bug reports, email quadpoptowers@gmail.com, with as much information as possible about the bug you hit (screenshots are great) so I can fix it up in a future version.</p>Music and Art Credits<p>I'm not an artist, so thanks to the following creators for their assets.
