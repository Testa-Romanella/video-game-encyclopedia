Follow him as he finds a way to escape, fixing a boat and discovering what the seemingly abandoned\u00a0farm has to offer for him.</p>\n<p><strong>TRAILER:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURE LIST:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Horror and adventure</strong> - The game takes inspiration from different game genres, as well as some genre specifics from folktales. Even so, if you strip away the game\u2019s design and gameplay into fundamentals, it\u2019s strictly an horror/adventure game. The player should feel adrenaline from being hunted by the monster as well as feel adventurous while wondering what\u2019s next in the story.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Huldra and Norwegian folklore</strong> - Birk finds himself trapped in an abandoned Norwegian mountain farm, but he isn\u2019t completely alone. A female figure roams around him, and he has a strange nostalgic feeling towards her.</li><li><strong>Survive, escape </strong>- Trapped on a mountain farm, Birk wants to find a way to escape and get back home. Finding a blueprint of a boat, he wanders around trying to find it, only to find it\u2019s broken and need to be fixed.</li><li><strong>Interact with Hylja</strong> - Hylja\u2019s apparent friendly manner leads to Birk trusting her a little too easy. Her motives become clear in a short while, as she asks him to marry her. This is when Birk realises his situation; as he denies her love, she turns into a monster unlike any other, almost not recognisable from her previous state.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Outline of objects\u00a0might persist as you stop looking at them, which can be fixed by just looking at it again and then looking away.</li><li>Hair physics on Hylja do not collide with their meshes.\u00a0</li><li>Some materials emitting light are not present in the ship build, but is being worked on.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK:</strong></p>\n<p>We would\u00a0<strong>greatly</strong> appreciate feedback, and hope to hear your opinions on our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42acd6ad8358915e9c324d2404feb741.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Audizo", "elinab", "kristinalmvik"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
