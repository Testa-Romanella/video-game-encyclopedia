It was made over 30 days for the theme of subversive edutainment. It is an equipment simulator.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to replace the defective parts of the engine. Pulling the starter handle will trigger smoke to show you whatever is currently broken. You might need to dig in a couple levels to get to the broken part and replace them.</p><p>All the interactions are a simple click or drag. Drag the chainsaw to spin it, click and hold items to pick them up. Click and hold on parts to remove them if they are able to be removed.</p>\n<p>Replacement parts are strewn about on the bench.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately as a prototype there is a fair amount of bugs/issues. You can enter a failure state if a needed part falls off the table.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f03b5e413a98979696ee89d65cbc9c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elrobo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
