You can jump to interrupt any movement, and slide jumping gives you a significant forward boost.</p>\n<p>You can throw boots to collect blue mushrooms, or walk into them manually.<br/><br/>If you somehow get stuck (which has never happened to me as the dev) you can press R to respawn.<br/></p>\n\r\nPost your final time + thoughts down below! \r\n<p>Final time is after you loop back to the first level. Sorry the timer doesn't stop, I ran out of time to code it ;)<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made in one week by one person, for the 2022 UNC Collegiate Game Jam.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Gnome Soup uses photoscanned 3D assets for the entirety of its 3D models.
