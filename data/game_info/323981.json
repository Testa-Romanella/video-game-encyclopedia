Of course only a handful of people actually believe in this age-old Urban legend. Sasaki Jiro is not one of those people. He's never believed it not even as a small child, now he's finally returning to his home and his opinion hasn't changed in the least.<br/><br/>Plagued by strange visions as he returns to his hometown for his final year of high school, Jiro's younger cousin, Inoue Sora somehow manages to get Jiro to join the Astronomy Club. Among the two cousins in the club are Fujimoto Shiro, Jiro's childhood friend, Nura Misaki, a mysterious loner, Chitose Akira, the energetic class president, Hasekura Hinako, a preppy seventh grader, and Sendo Yuichi, a perverted honor student. Eventually, Jiro begins enjoying his time with the Astronomy Club but underneath all the happiness and playful comedy there are dark secrets lurking inside everyone's souls. The mystery of the Kiseki tree looms over Okaraka town in plain sight...</p><p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong><br/>Writing by Chris J.

The extras menu does not work as of right now since I figured there wasn't really a need for it yet. You only see it because it's a part of the main menu's imagemap. Also I did my best to proofread everything and make sure there were as little typos and grammar mistakes as possible, however I don't have an editor yet and am just one man, so there might still be a few issues here and there. Please do let me know if you find any.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:43:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/39472f5f27b46a3401d796528124e126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris J.
