Overthrow the tyrannical King Crambone by fighting waves of his armies and warm the tiny black soulless heart of the wizard Thaco in a Monty Python-esque strategy game!!! Use motion and gesture spell casting and build your defensive towers to take over King Crambone\u2019s kingdom one duchy at a time.<br/><br/><br/>This game is all about fine tuning your strategy so it makes Djinni &amp; Thaco instantly replayable and addictive. We also didn\u2019t forget the importance of story. With over 20 plus hours of game play across 3 unique modes, volumetric cutscenes, and a guest appearance by Lloyd Kaufman<br/><br/>Did we mention this is all first person? So there is no god/overhead view like a typical strategy game? Yes, you are right in the battle, not watching from above. This game is a nice departure from the countless zombie FPS shooters and rhythm games out there flooding the VR market. With easter eggs and multiple endings, you need to click \u201cadd to cart\u201d and start playing!<br/><br/><br/><strong>MAGIC with Motion, BABY! </strong><br/>Move your arms (motion and gesture) to cast spells, with almost no button presses. Just remember you need to build the right towers to unlock your magic abilities.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In Game Commentary, ya know like sports announcers?!?!?!?!?!</strong><br/>Burton \u201cThe Duke\u201d Archibald and Wolf Hawkins are your play-by-play announcers on the battlefield!  Their attitude evolves towards you as the story grows.<br/><br/><br/><strong>A narrative told with awesome tech!</strong><br/>The story is told with cutting edge volumetric video. Enjoy the story without the typical 2D screen that pops up in VR or the GAWD AWFUL 360 video.<br/><br/><strong>Keep your head in the addictive highly replayable game! </strong><br/>Hate cutscenes and just want to play? Our stuff is skippable! We\u2019ve all been forced to do tutorials all over again after playing the game, so we made that skippable, too!<br/><br/><br/>For support and any gameplay issues email: http://djinnithacosupport@darkcatt.com<br/><br/>**** No elves, demons, or dwarfs were injured in the making of this game.
