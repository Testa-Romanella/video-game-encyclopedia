He thought he didn\u2019t need the pity or coddling of the world around him. He flatly turned down the concern of anyone except his parents.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStruggling through life with that mindset, he marched forward only to fall flat on his face.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDespair. He only realized only at his lowest how much he had taken for granted. He was neither a genius nor special. He was no better than anyone else.<br/>\r\nBut he realized too late.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKnowing how he once treated those around him in the past, he felt unworthy of help. As such, he willingly succumbed to his fate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEven so, she dragged him out of that darkness and into the light. She gave him back his smile and made it brighter than ever. The world gave him another chance and gently embraced him, even though he didn't deserve it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinally rejecting his notions of invincibility, he returned to his hometown for the first time in six years, bringing her along with him. Still fazed from having emerged from such a dark period, he wondered what he should do as his next steps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen, something changed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe moment he got off that platform and breathed in the familiar yet unsettling smell of home, the world around him changed in a few timeless instants.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs jarring as a cold breeze in the middle of July, another girl's voice enters the picture. No matter what sorts of dark secrets it may reveal, the work of providence itself ensures that what begins on the platform ends on the platform.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c9/3c9ee40949b568d8b75de2c987dd1102.jpg", "website": "http://the9thday.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lingtanstudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["lingtanstudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
