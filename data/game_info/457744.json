It is a sequel to Irem&#39;s 1984 coin-operated video game Spartan X (released internationally by Data East under the title of Kung-Fu Master), which was later ported to the Family Computer by Nintendo in 1985. In turn, Spartan X was originally a tie-in to the 1984 Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (released as Spartan X in Japan). Spartan X 2 did not receive a North American release until 2016, when it was included as a built-in title for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console under the name Kung-Fu Master 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-18T15:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d1259753310db3705659913cc8429d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Tamtex"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Irem Software Engineering"], "esrb_rating": null}
