To make the game fun you have to challenge yourself with different ways to get to the end of the level (the only level there is). One way I have found to challenge myself with is to go all the way to the right of the platform and try to get to the end by staying on the edge of the platform.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T05:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfc26dedac0e7787916051f2fbd7ea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Terabyte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
