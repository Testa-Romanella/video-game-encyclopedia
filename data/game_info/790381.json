There's a ball that bounces around, and the players have planks on either side that they can move around and hit the ball with. The goal is to not let the ball get past your plank. For the player on the left, wasd keys are used to control the plank, and for the player on the right it's the arrow keys.\u00a0 You can also play against an AI opponent(the default game mode), and you'll be surprised at how hard it is. If you find it too hard though, feel free to go to the settings and decrease the ball speed. Hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/affdb6c5b80e1fb9d12667067a750263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuhil"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
