I was trying to made a small local multiplayer arcade racing game\u00a0 where you can loose parts and then fix/upgrade the car with money won by ending the race. Of course if your car is destroyed you start again from scratch.</p>\n<p>Made on Unity 2017 because I was trying to port it to PS Vita also (unfortunately it runs at 3FPS like this and I can't debug / use a profiler on the console)<br/></p>\n<p>Up to 4 players (Thanks to Rewired plugin), P1 and P2 can use the keyboard or you can use XBOX controller or equivalent game pad.</p>\n<p>First trial with toon shader since I was looking for Cel-shading effect on cars and terrain but I have a long way to go to master it.</p>\n<p>\r\nFirst \"real\" trial at 3D modelisation with Blender 3D for the car. Not so obvious but not bad for a first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Performance are sub-optimal. If I ever touch this prototype again I will check in the profiler what happens.</p>\n\n<p>Player 1 Keyboard:</p>\n<p>* Up/Down arrows: Accelerate / Brake<br/>* Left / Right arrows: Turn left / right<br/>* End: handbrakes<br/>* Backslah: change view<br/>* Backquote: respawn vehicle<br/>* P: pause</p>\n<p>Player 2 Keyboard:</p>\n<p>* Z/S: Accelerate / Brake\r\n<br/>* Q/D: Turn left / right\r\n<br/>* X: handbrakes\r\n<br/>* V: change view<br/>\r\n* R: respawn vehicle\r\n<br/>* P: pause</p>\n<p>XBox Controller:</p>\n<p>* Left/Right trigger: Brake/Accelerate<br/>* Left Stick X: Turn left/right<br/>* B: handbrakes<br/>* Right stick press: change view<br/>* Y: Respawn<br/>* Start: pause<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c29379cfccdff324ac6850f1c7ddeeb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["LaDropZone"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
