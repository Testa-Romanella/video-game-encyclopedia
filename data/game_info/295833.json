Right now I'm experimenting with player attachment to artifacts in a virtual environment, and making a space feel real by normalizing its\u00a0representational elements.\u00a0There is no explicit goal, but there are properties of the world and the objects to discover.\u00a0The build is packaged with one seed, so you will always experience the same world on the same system.</p>\n<p>This game also features the alt first-person control scheme I've been messing with. Inspired the run mechanic in Receiver, I wanted to make walking feel less cruise control. I'm also using simpler Doom-style look controls that reduce needless degrees of freedom.
