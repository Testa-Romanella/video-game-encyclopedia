It has been developed\u00a0 with Unity for the GMTK game jam 2021. The theme of the jam was \"joined together\". Its gameplay rely on joining different kind of worker, ressources and locations together in a big economic network to produce more and more advanced techonologies. It\u00a0proposes to illustrate how any product is the result of the joint labor of a multitude of people.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li>Drag the round anchor at the end of a wire on an empty place in the timeline\u00a0to build a new location.</li><li>Drag the round anchor at the end of a wire on an existing location to link two locations and create a new ressource.</li><li>The anchor that has been placed can\u00a0 be removed or moved only if no location depends on it.</li><li>The wire has limited size and the number of anchor that can be linked to a location is limited so be careful to not be stucked.

The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the\u00a0scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their\u00a0different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants and\u00a0carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those\u00a0workmen to others who often live in a very distant part of the country! How much commerce\u00a0and navigation in particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must\u00a0have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of by the dyer, which\u00a0often come from the remotest corners of the world! What a variety of labor too is necessary in\u00a0order to produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated\u00a0machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let us\u00a0consider only what a variety of labor is requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the\u00a0shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for smelting\u00a0the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smeltinghouse, the brick-maker, the brick-layer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the mill-wright, the\u00a0forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/13521e8e234f205d1bf46e5e9986e9f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["edmond00"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
