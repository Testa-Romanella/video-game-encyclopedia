It&#39;s sort of a love letter to those games. It was also the first game project I completed, so it&#39;s very roughly put together and really unpolished. I advise you to play the sequels instead!The game follows the story of Isadora, an orphaned child who goes into a forbidden land to attempt to ressurect her mother.<br />\nIt&#39;s meant to be challenging like an &quot;arcade&quot; game. I hope you enjoy it!Title screen artwork was drawn by Temmie Chang!<br />\nTroubleshooting<br />\n1 - Controller SupportUnfortunately, this game does not support any controllers natively. I recommend using a program called &quot;antimicro&quot; that allows you to bind keyboard keys to controller buttons.2- If you are having trouble running the game, please try the following:Open Task Manager, go to the &quot;Services&quot; tab and disable &quot;Spooler&quot;.Make sure your .NET framework, DirectX, Audio drivers, and Video drivers are updated.Alternatively, try running the game with XP compatibility mode or in Admin mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-04T17:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3c8f1fc441d21fe2850c45eb367b0da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bombservice", "rdein"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
