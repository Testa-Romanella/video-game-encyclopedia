The game resembles the old-school jRPG titles, and made with RPG-maker \u2014 a set of software tools designed to make traditional RPGs. <br />\nWith an average playtime of 5 hours, Skyborn offers a world populated with Skyborn race. The Protagonist, Claret Spencer, becomes drawn into the adventure of saving his home city and reclaiming the right on it. The game includes many NPCs \u2014 one of the primary focuses was to write down all of the game dwellers&#39; personalities as detailed as possible. The plot of the game is catchy, well-designed and does not look like a typical RPG-Maker game \u2014 such titles do not even reach the greenlight often.<br />\nThe gameplay, however, is widely considered to be borrowed from classical jRPGs \u2014 the typical mission includes traveling throughout vast locations and bringing the items. Given the low density of playable content, these quests happen to be quite burdening in the sequence of the continuous plot uncovering.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T13:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/8657fc8f962f3e76ed1cea190323c4ef.jpg", "website": "http://www.dancingdragongames.com/2012/skyborn/", "rating": 2.38, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 97, "owned": 1525, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 19}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 63, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 63, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dancing Dragon Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Degica"], "esrb_rating": null}
