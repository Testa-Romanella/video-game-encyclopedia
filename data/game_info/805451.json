{"id": 805451, "slug": "portal-connection", "name": "Portal Connection", "name_original": "Portal Connection", "description": "<p>This is a\u00a0<strong>Game Jam entry</strong> with the theme of <strong>connection</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This is a very early build which does not even have gameplay elements thrashed out yet, but does have the spaceship flying mechanics, and working radar inside the ship. Enjoy the flight.\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>In a nutshell, sci-fi theme, you are a '<strong>traveler</strong>', a special class of being,\u00a0 in a future world. A traveler must only stay in a world for a limited time, cursed if you like, to continually travel between worlds to survive, a continual connection between worlds is a thin connection to life.</p>\n<p>This period of life begins in their 27th year (traveler years), and\u00a0 must pass through 27 connection gates, or portals, with the clock ticking down before each portal closes. Passing through a portal takes them to a new place.\u00a0Failure to pass through it\u00a0 in time\u00a0means instant death, or worse, stuck in the same world, eternally.\u00a0 Passing through 27 successfully would grant them life. Missing the portal by a short distance (27 traveler units if the truth be known) may cause great instability and unknown consequences to the portal, the area around the portal, or even the world therein. Seeing a connection here perhaps? Yes, there is a connection, a cosmic connection, between the number 27, and travelers.\u00a0 I've noticed the prevalence of this number in my life for a while now.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these ancient portals are often in disrepair, and parts may be scattered about, or have been taken, or worse,\u00a0 sabotaged. You will need to find them, using your portal radar equipped in your ship.\u00a0Once you find them they will automatically return to the portal, using your magical traveler powers.<br/><br/>Be careful, in each world there are\u00a0enemies of the travelers.\u00a0\u00a0A fierce, passed down through generations,\u00a0rivalry, lasting a millennium, ready to prevent you from leaving this world, ridding the galaxies of all travelers, is what every world has planned for. Nobody remembers why.\u00a0 Perhaps, the answer lies somewhere above with portal instability, threatening worlds.</p>\n<p>There was a blind prophet, from a mere century ago, who had forewarned, what he had seen in his dreams, that if enough travelers, had coexisted in one moment in time during their travel phases, in enough worlds, then they would be granted super powers, and eternal life. Naturally, this has led to fear of travelers. Is it all a myth, a wonderful story?</p>\n<p>This program will likely only contain the first level initially.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f2959b276584873277bcf9b70e9e30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loucsam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
