JK, I actually have one.</p>\n<p>This is a visual novel I made using Renpy.</p>\n<p>This is the story of someone who is about to lose his job and be replaced by automated machines, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Of course I spent time working on the story, but most of the time I spent was on the way the player and the game interact with each other, which led to some interesting(maybe? hopefully so) results. See for yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is not very long.
