So I recreated it as a totally new game with a New Theme, New Homemade Graphic's,\u00a0 and More Levels.\u00a0 For this game I made a 40kb NROM version and 64kb UNROM version that are both Identical games. Encase one version doesn't fit the rules.</p>\n<p>This only has 32 levels out the 64 that Retro Puzzle Maker allows but I figured after 32 levels you would get bored of this game plus I wanted to get this entered into the Compo as soon as I could as I am already Kinda Late. I estimated that it would take about 18 minutes to play through the whole game, but I played through on a speed run in just 14 minutes, so it's a bit short.</p>\n<p>All My Games Present and Future will be made available for downloading Free of any Charge or Payment, but If you would like to donate to my Nes Game Making Efforts you can do so here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/171/171f290b5eed61eacb57f83165c32bb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Debiru"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
