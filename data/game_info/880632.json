You've been at it for a long long time. So long, in fact, that your clientele is getting quite old. So old, in fact, that all their hair is falling out and you will no doubt soon be out of business. This simply will not do.</p>\n<p>But, you have a plan. A genius plan that only you could have come up with. you will simply sneak into a top-secret government facility that your uncle works at and accidentally leaked at that one Christmas dinner and steal their Grow Gun. With it, you could grow back your old clientele's hair and they'll be forced to come back to you for haircuts. Yea, you're a genius.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD to move\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click to grow\r\n</p>\n<p>Right-click to shrink\r\n</p>\n<p>Made in one week for the Game/Music Jam.
