At the start an empty map presents itself to you. You are free to place cells (small black squares) wherever you want on the map with the left click. Disable the pause with the space key and let the \"magic\" happen.<br/> You are probably wondering how simple cells can give rise to such forms ...</p>\n<p>This world is governed by only two rules:</p>\n<ul><li>A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive (it is born);</li><li>A living cell with two or three living neighbors remains, otherwise it dies.</li></ul>\n<p>And yes ! That's all !<br/></p>\n<p><em>(The rules of this game are not my creation, they are those of John Horton Conway</em><em>)</em></p>\n<p>There are many possible forms:</p>\n<ul><li>Ships</li><li>The cannons</li><li>Spacefillers</li><li>The gardens of Eden</li><li>etc ...</li></ul>\n<p>A minimap is present to help you keep an eye on everything ...</p>\n<p>The keys:</p>\n<ul><li>Left click -&gt; add cells</li><li>Ctrl+Left Click -&gt; remove cells</li><li>Right click -&gt; move on the map</li><li>Scroll -&gt; Zoom / Unzoom</li><li>Space -&gt; pause / play</li><li>R -&gt; reset the map and the generation counter to zero</li><li>C -&gt; change the color of the cells</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/030d7350c438924b3c59744457392ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raiden"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
