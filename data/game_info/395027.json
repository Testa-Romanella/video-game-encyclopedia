Each hero has 1 passive skill and 5 active skills. Each skill can be upgraded to be more powerful. You can upgrade 2 skills per hero. You also have a budget of 3,000 coins to buy equipments for your heroes. Each piece of equipment is unique, you can only have one copy of them per team.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat System:<br/></strong> The fight begins with a placement phase where you must place your 3 heroes on the board on the starting tiles of your team (cyan or orange). You can see the details of your team as well as the opponent team at the bottom of the game screen. Once both players have placed their heroes, the fight starts. The cyan team begins. Each of your heroes have several actions and movements (3 and 4 by default). Actions allow the use of skills or usable objects and movements allow to move on the board.
