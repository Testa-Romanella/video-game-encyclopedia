She feels like her beloved legends are trying to warn her about the return of an ancient murderous monster. Will she be able to save the people she cares about when they say that monsters aren't real?</p>\r\n\u2746The setting:\r\n<p>The story takes place in a fictional world resembling Middle Ages Europe with the religion being close to Christianity.</p>\n<p>Hidden deep in a snowy forest lies a secluded Weissfield Monastery. Said monastery shares the name with a nearby village, which, in turn, was named after it's founders - the Weissfield family, whose descendants still rule the village.</p>\n\n\r\n\u2746The characters:\r\n<p>Eleonora (Nellie)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The protagonist and the narrator of the story. A 16 years old novice in Weissfield Monastery. A bookworm and a daydreamer, she is very curious and gets swept away in fantasies easily. Nellie is brave and loyal, and would do anything in order to protect the people she loves.</p>\n<p>Cybill</p>\n<p>Nellie's best friend and a fellow novice. Being 2 years older than Nellie, Cybill is more mature and, at the same time, more rebellious.</p>\n\n<p>Sister Vanessa</p>\n<p>Smart, serious and beautiful, this lady is respected by many nuns and the chief of Weissfield village himself. If only she wasn't so scary when she loses her temper...</p>\n<p>Sister Monica</p>\n<p>This woman loves fancy things and teasing people. Maybe she is a little eccentric for a nun, but Sister Monica's cooking is so good that everyone overlooks her odd behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Nathaniel (Nate) Weissfield</p>\n<p>The son and the heir of the village chief. He has romantic feelings for Nellie and shares her fondness of legends.</p>\n\n\r\n\u2746The team:\r\n<p><strong>Concept and planning:</strong>\u00a0Shoggoth on the Roof,\u00a0AnankeKeirin<br/><strong>Writing:</strong>\u00a0AnankeKeirin<br/><strong>English translation:</strong>\u00a0Shoggoth on the Roof<br/><strong>Sprite/CG sketches, sprite/CG edits, GUI, programming:</strong>\u00a0AnankeKeirin<br/><strong>Sprite/CG lineart and colouring:</strong>\u00a0Shoggoth on the Roof</p>\n\n\r\n\u2746Features:\r\n<p>- kinetic novel (= no choices)</p>\n<p>- about 12800 words</p>\n<p>- 11 CG illustrations</p>\r\nContent warning: violence, depictions of blood, character death,\u00a0screen shakes and flashes\r\n<p>P.S.
