The Throne of Bernicia is a fond homage to the RPGs of my youth, pretty much played straight and without any big twist on the formula. It was a whole lot of fun to work on, and hopefully you'll have fun playing it too!<h3>Credits &amp; Attribution</h3><br/>This game was made using Kadokawa/Enterbrain's RPG Maker MV, mostly with the stock assets that came with the program.
