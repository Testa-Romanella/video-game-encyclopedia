There's a group of happy children staying in the Camp. You and your six Camp Counselor friends are watching over the kids while enjoying the lake and the wilderness. The days are bright and sunny. The nights are cool and clear. And Jason is on a rampage.\r\n\r\nIt's up to you to stop him, but it's not going to be easy. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood sucking bats and hordes of mindless zombies everywhere you turn. You must also help any friend who is in danger, or else you can just kiss them goodbye. And hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe won't keep you safe \u2013 Jason will find you anywhere. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason face to face, and destroy him.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b99942ae00d3f4a78f5a8deeacd03e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["LJN"], "esrb_rating": null}
