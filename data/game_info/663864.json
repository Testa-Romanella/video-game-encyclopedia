Not much is known about it, but the label reads \"A True Simulated Nature Experience\"\r\n<p>Made for A Game By its Cover 2021, based on the Famicase Exhibition art by NAT KING <br/></p>\n<br/>My game is dedicated to online spaces/games from the 2000s that no longer exist. <br/>I had bigger plans for it that didn't get included (my energy is pretty low due to lockdown + work), but I fell in love with Nat's Famicase art and had to make something even if it's only a small experience! I really like it and hope you do too :)<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b1d6c2315a7a44f4e794fe679d5f6ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Olivia Haines"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
