(well, except Medicine)<br/>It's a danmaku experience full of poisons and suffocation.<br/><br/>That means, this is a shooting game (bullet hell), where the screen is full of enemy<br/>bullets which you have to avoid, and enemies which you have to shoot.<br/><br/>Your goal is to defeat the enemies and clear the levels one at a time, in sequence,<br/>to solve the incident affecting Gensokyo.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[2.Story]</ul>Gensokyo suddenly plunged into a huge miasma of toxic fog, and the lands are now<br/>gloomy and lifeless. But that is not the only problem: Children\u2019s spirits have flooded out<br/>en masse to possess nearby phantoms and fairies.<br/>The source of these strange phenomena is the Nameless Hill, a forgotten land of sin.<br/>These spirits have overwhelmed the lands, from the Sai no Kawara to Gensokyo, and the<br/>miasma\u2019s spread has taken the usual human incident resolvers out of commission.<br/><br/>In response, the sage Okina Matara held a discussion with the other sages of Gensokyo,<br/>and sent out her two dancers to solve the incident. Meanwhile, in the Primate Spirit Garden,<br/>Keiki Haniyasushin sent out her pride and joy \u2013- Mayumi Joutouguu \u2013- to investigate,<br/>in the hopes of expanding her territory into Gensokyo.<br/>As for Medicine Melancholy, someone who dwells in the Nameless Hill itself, she appearsto have set off on her own. In particular, she is conducting her affairs, in her own time,<br/>separately compared to the others, as if with her own agenda in mind.<br/><br/>Thus, the four of them headed towards the Nameless Hill.<br/>Coincidentally, all four of them are doll-like beings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[3.Controls]</ul>Up, down, left, right : Control your character<br/>Shot key (Z) : Shoot<br/>Bomb key (X) : Spell card (bomb) (limited use)<br/>Slow key (Shift) : Slow down your movement.<br/>This puts your character in a focused state (focusing),<br/>so your character\u2019s hitbox and grazebox will also be visible. <br/>Pause key (Esc) : Pause the game<br/>User 1 key (C) : Perform a Spirit Release (explained later)<br/>User 2 key (V) : Press and hold this key after the first text box of any dialogue scene,<br/>to skip subsequent text boxes.<br/>In-game, only Satono and Mai can use this key, to swap between each other.<br/><br/>Please see the \u201cconfig.exe\u201d file next to the game executable,<br/>for reference and reassigning of the controls above.<br/><br/>Alt+Enter : Toggles between window mode and fullscreen mode.<br/>Left Ctrl: Speeds up replays and the Staff Roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[4.System and items]</ul>Spellcard item : Gives you an extra spell card (bomb).<br/><br/>Point item : These give you score, and also raise your M-Point Item Value.<br/>The height at which you collect them is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Infant spirit item : Collecting this charges up your Spirit Release for use.<br/>See the relevant section for further details.<br/><br/>Infant Spirit Meter : When spirit items are collected, the Infant Spirit Meter on the right<br/>of the screen fills up. See Spirit Release for further details.<br/><br/>Heart\u2019s Poison Meter : This is a meter of lily of the valley flowers (a.k.a. suzuran, or<br/>convallaria majalis) on the far right. As you graze bullets, the<br/>meter fills from right to left. Once full, it turns white, and<br/>you unlock a Last Word, an optional end-of-level extra<br/>attack. Last Words do not take away lives or bombs even if<br/>you fail, so they are always beneficial to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[5.Spirit Release]</ul>Defeated spirits and fairies drop a fixed amount of infant spirit items.<br/>Infant spirit items fill the Infant Spirit Meter on the right of the screen.<br/><br/>When it is full, you can use a Spirit Release with the User 1 key (C), and release the<br/>infants\u2019 spirits around you. This creates a shockwave attack that keeps you invincible,<br/>and clears away enemies and their bullets, like taking candy from a baby.<br/>Except you\u2019re taking the babies... and you\u2019re throwing the babies at enemies...<br/>and the babies have long since passed away. (there\u2019s no candy either lol)<br/><br/>There\u2019s no candy, but each Spirit Release produces a free spellcard item (bomb) for you,<br/>so use the Spirit Release proactively!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[6.Miasma Promptuary]</ul>A list of the poison clouds you will see in this game is provided below.<br/>Pink : Has a diamond texture. Collect it for an extra life! Oh, how refreshing!<br/>Red : Staying inside for too long is dangerous; you will lose a life after 1 second.<br/>Orange: These clouds fire out bullets, so stay far away.<br/>Yellow : You\u2019ll be immobilised as long as you\u2019re inside it.<br/>Green : You\u2019ll move faster as long as you\u2019re inside it, for better or worse.<br/>Light blue : Totally safe; guides your way through poison. Can still visually distract you.<br/>Indigo : A puff of pacifism. You won\u2019t be able to shoot when inside.<br/>Purple : Perhaps you\u2019re already familiar with purple miasma; it slows you down.<br/>It\u2019s an old friend! But you have no camera to help you this time.<br/>Use the Poison Lab found in the main menu to practice working with the poisons'<br/>appearances and effects for yourself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[7.Advice for Novices]</ul>Pink poison clouds with diamond textures are Extends (extra lives). Get extra bombs from<br/>Spirit Releases. Please look for the pink clouds and frequently use Spirit Releases! Pink clouds<br/>have diamond textures, but there are also dangerous red poisons -- you must tell them apart.<br/><br/>If you see suspicious objects approaching, a basic strategy is Streaming and Restreaming.<br/>Focus (press Shift), then slowly move sideways, thus gathering aimed bullets together behind<br/>you, giving you space. When running out of space, do a quick dash in the same direction, wait,<br/>and let the aimed attacks target your new location. Then you can stream back in reverse.<br/><br/>Remember to use spell cards (bombs) anytime you feel threatened; it\u2019s wiser than wasting<br/>all the bombs you currently have after accidentally getting hit. (The excess WILL be lost.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[8.Scoring]</ul>For advanced players looking to reach a high score, it is essential to avoid getting hit<br/>needlessly, capture spell cards successfully, and collect point items, which do not change their<br/>value depending on your height. Having lots of lives, spell cards, and point items ensures the<br/>end-of-stage score bonus is higher.<br/><br/>Grazing helps, but is not single-handedly enough to greatly influence score.<br/>Of course, you should ensure you graze enough to unlock the Last Word, in order to get its<br/>spell card bonus and point items as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>[9.Flower Wreath of Death]</ul>If you are hit by a bullet, a flower wreath effect appears on you and shrinks away in<br/>half a second. Using a spell card (bomb) during this time produces a deathbomb.<br/>Deathbombs are almost identical to normal spell cards (bombs), but there will be an<br/>additional flower wreath that expands outwards from you. Continuous damage is dealt to<br/>enemies enclosed within.<br/>Do note that deathbombs will always consume TWO spell cards. Only one spell card will<br/>be consumed if you have exactly one left.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T02:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a17e2bb3b81aac72ca59333defde0693.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5e78\u6b78\u9234\u5712"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5e78\u6b78\u9234\u5712"], "esrb_rating": null}
