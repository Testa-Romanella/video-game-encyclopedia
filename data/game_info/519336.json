The first wave always starts with a charging phase, during this phase both players are subject to the same rhythm pattern and must hit the notes accordingly to gain attack points. Once the first wave is over, the first attack phase starts and the player on the left side is allowed to attack (this will switch to the right player in the next attack wave). Simply press buttons accordingly to spawn notes on your opponents bar if you are attacking, your opponent will then have to hit the notes to the rhythm that you created, otherwise take damage. The attack phase is only considered over when the attacking player has spent all their attack points, by then the wave switches back to the charging phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls for left side player:</strong></p>\n<p>- A for black notes</p>\n<p>- D for white notes</p>\n<p>- W to attack with black notes</p>\n<p>- S to attack with white notes</p>\n<p><strong>Controls for right side player:</strong></p>\n<p>- Right key for black notes</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Left key for white notes</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Up key to attack with black notes</p>\n<p>- Down\u00a0key\u00a0to attack with white notes</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing/checking out my game, I hope to release a full version soon without being rushed.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a9/6a908c02f61f383c450a94d716848339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBroook"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
