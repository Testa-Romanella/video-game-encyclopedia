Shoot space rocks to collect points and get the required amount of points to move on to the next level. There are power-ups like the Laser which enables auto-fire for several seconds and the Shield which gives the ship a 3-hit shield to bounce space rocks around. There are secrets at Level 5 and Level 10 but be warned, the difficulty quickly increases.</p>\n\n<p>Still has room for development. May be adding more to Level 10 and balancing spawn-rates and stuff.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of my\u00a0first games so constructive criticism is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fdde9f516a57f17c1e736413e1dee37f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Treethan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
