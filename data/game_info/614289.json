Blocking incoming shurikens lets you deflect them and redirect them.</p>\n<p>You also have three useful dashes to dodge attacks or move fast recharging over time.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get to the the flag at the end of the level after killing every enemy. But beware, just one hit from the enemies and you will be dead!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>wasd - move</p>\n<p>mouse - look around</p>\n<p>left click - attack</p>\n<p>right click - block</p>\n<p>spacebar/shift - dash</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plans for the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Because it's still in development, only 5 levels are actually playable. And they are all playable from the start.\u00a0In the next versions I want to:</p>\n<p>- add the remaining 5 levels (maybe even more)</p>\n<p>- add at least 3 new enemies</p>\n<p>- time slowing ability</p>\n<p>- traps</p>\n<p>- maybe a final boss</p>\n<p>- save files</p>\n<p>Tell me what I should add or change!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Download Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Download the .zip files, unzip it and open the Roningasa\u00a0 Game folder.
