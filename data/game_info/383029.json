There are <strong>5 levels</strong> in total with <strong>2 different enemies</strong>, who should make this game impossibly difficult, but your ability to slow down\u00a0time with your movement makes it a cakewalt if you plan your moves right...</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>SUPERHOT</strong>\u00a0<strong>time moves as you move</strong>. You use this game mechanic to <strong>dodge bullets and plan your shots carefully</strong>. This makes it much more <strong>strategic</strong> than other singleplayer first-person-shooters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our game the <strong>focus is more around dodging bullets</strong> and trying to make your way to the enemy before <strong>jumping on them</strong>. If you get too close, they stop shooting, which gives you an opportunity to kill them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game was programmed completely from scratch by me,\u00a0<strong>Murlchjeller </strong>and<strong> IronLe</strong><strong>o</strong> in <strong>Construct 2</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would greatly appreciate some feedback and ratings!</p>\r\nHave fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:06:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d37a763ed8b117ac24cd3ca585d8e7e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
