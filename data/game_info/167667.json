There are a multitude of levels from 1 to 40 in which the time gets shorter and the words get longer. In each level you are given unique words which you must type when they are presented to you, of course, you have limited time to complete all these words. Don't worry because any incorrect spellings will be ignored but if you run out of time, you lose. This game has a nice amount of sound-effects and basic animations to not bore you. All animations are in the actual game-state of my game and they include Trex eating D-xert. When you start the game you will have access to only level 1. when you complete level one you will unlock level two. Once you finish level 40 you win the entire game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e615f4a12b9b3d1d30ef05a1f69a9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["whisked"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
