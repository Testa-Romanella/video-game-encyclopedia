The time limit was 2 hours but I went in to overtime 10 times. A over time being 10 minutes. So the actual time of creation was 3 hours and 40 minutes. Not bad for a first attempt at this quick style, but it is a -10. The prompt I generated was handicapped motorcycle and medicine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d69/d69570000b8a331bcb784b5dbf201844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["20potter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
