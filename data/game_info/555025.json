The prompts for when to use each will appear on the game screen.</p>\n<p>This game was made in three days\u00a0for the Nokia 3310 Jam 3. I've released it in the original 84x48 Nokia resolution (the 'lo' version), as you might have played it on your phone\u00a0back in the day, as well as a more playable 840x480 resolution (the standard version). I hope you enjoy it.</p><p>The game is built in the Godot game engine, and all the art was made using Aseprite and Krita.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b1081ea51b1ad32da55e5ad0f825fbe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jeff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
