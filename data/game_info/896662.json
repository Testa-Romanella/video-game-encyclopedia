Each level is slightly different and can be completed in a matter of minutes. Build up a tiny but perfectly formed city block from randomly generated tiles, try out a variety of colour palettes and map sizes, then sit back, relax, and bask in the glory of your adorable creation!<br/><br/>Like my last project The Ramp, The Block is designed more as a \u2018digital toy\u2019 than a game: a short, satisfying experience that\u2019ll make your day a little bit better and costs less than a slice of pizza. <br/><br/>Thanks for checking out my page!
