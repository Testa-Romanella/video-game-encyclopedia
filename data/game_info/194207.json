To do this, you need to burn fat by exercising. However,do not forget to eat and go to work. All seemingly simple. But, that is not all. The food is equally useful. The energy is recovered not only from food, but also recovered independently at intervals. So, if you have not stalled, just relax and recover some energy. But, be careful if your weight doubles instead of reducing it is not good for your health.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82afb8d92865e89862400ebab3775c3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SmartFrog"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
