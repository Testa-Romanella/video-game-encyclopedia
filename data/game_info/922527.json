There are five levels complete, and you advance to the next level by beating the specified number of baddies.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Left Mouse Click - Fire</li><li>Right Mouse Click - Activate Special<strong>\u00a0(</strong>with full energy)</li><li>Press 'R' when dead to restart the level</li></ul>\n<p><strong>UI</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ships</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently two ships available, the SHIVA and the ODIN. The hope was to add more.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>SHIVA - Basic ship, mostly all rounded with a slight edge to attacking. The Special ability will set your ship's cannon to rapid fire mode.</li><li>ODIN - A defensive wall. The Special ability will dramatically increase your shield regeneration.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>PowerUps</strong></p>\n<p>There are three powerups to help you get through the game. They have a chance to spawn in place of an enemy.</p>\n<ul><li> \u00a0 - Restores health</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0- Restores shield</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0- Restores energy</li></ul>\n<p>This game is incredibly broken and not very balanced, but was fun to make in the short amount of time I\u00a0had to make it. I also am not 100% sure if it's beatable with the ODIN ship, but you're more than welcome to try! As always, feedback is greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Audio/Music</p>\n<p>Main Menu Theme - Hero Immortal by Trevor Lentz<br/>Chararacter Select Theme - Title Screen by Juhani Junkala<br/>Level 1 BGM - Level 3 by Juhani Junkala<br/>Level 2 BGM - Level 1 by Juhani Junkala<br/>Level 3 BGM - Rainging Bits<br/>Level 4 BGM - Mars by SketchyLogic<br/>Level 5 BGM - Level 2 by Juhani Junkala</p>\n<p>Background/Enemy/Player\u00a0Assets</p>\n<p>I\u00a0can't find the file I\u00a0had that kept track of where those assets came from.
