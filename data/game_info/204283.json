It was the second in a series of 5 'games' created for my semester one, year one studies at RMIT university. \u00a0Unfortunately, this game can only be played in the browser and with a computer. Please don't download it and modify the files, or post as your own. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this game caps out when the score reaches 288 and no longer works. There is some slight flashing (should not be too prominent) so if you're sensitive to flashing lights then please refrain from playing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2ff76b729eeb9a1d386d18ba236b331.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
