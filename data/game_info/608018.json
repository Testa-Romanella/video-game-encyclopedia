You are a novice mercenary in a war-torn world.  Hire your team, choose your classes, upgrade your equipment, and see how long you can survive.<br/><br/>Whether you want to hack your way to victory with powerful soldiers or strategically maneuver in the battlefield to maximize your profits, you can enjoy the game. <br/><br/>Created by a solo developer, Cascade Tactics seeks to recreate the fun of customizing and progressing a squad of characters (Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre). Cascade Tactics' strengths reside in its strategic gameplay, extremely smart AI, and highly customizable team.<br/> <br/>There is an option for AI to control your units if you are not a fan of micro-managing your characters; as well as an option to speed up animation time for quicker battles.<br/><br/><strong>Interactive Mechanics</strong>:<br/>Status Effects are linked (or channeled). Deal damage to the caster to stop the status effect.<br/><br/>Many actions take time before they are executed.  This gives the opponent time to react. Deal damage to the caster to stop the action.  Move / Push / Teleport units into or out of danger.  Protect the target with another action before he is hit. Change the target of the caster with <strong> Silencer's</strong> Redirect. These opportunities allow the battles to feel fun and interactive.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> Features a <strong>Dual-class</strong> system with interesting synergies.  <br/><br/>A <strong>Commander </strong>can issues commands to other units.  A <strong>Ninja </strong>can attack twice with his weapon.  When a character's two classes are Commander and Ninja you can issue commands to other units to attack twice.<br/><br/>A <strong>Sentinel</strong> can guard tiles with his weapon. A <strong>Pyromancer </strong>can deal damage to an area with Flames.  When a character has both classes, he can guard locations with Flames: casting it anytime an enemy walks on the tile.<br/><br/>An <strong>Archer </strong>can add any magical ability to his weapon attack. A <strong>Necromancer </strong>can raise a Skeleton if the target of his ability dies. When combined, you can raise a skeleton upon killing a target.<br/><br/>A <strong>Lancer</strong> can add cast time to his weapon to deal more damage or add cast time to a spell to increase its area-of-effect.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cc/8cc97716c2015d4a5ce9c9bfcedebafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MythicMachine", "Mythic Machine Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mythic Machine Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
