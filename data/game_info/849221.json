The feel is similar, except there are additional velocities acting on you due to the maelstrom and ocean storm!</p>\n<p><strong>Your objective</strong> is to\u00a0to save people before they get sucked into the middle of the maelstrom - all while avoiding sharks! If you let someone die, or you get sucked in yourself, you lose!</p>\n<p>See how long you can last!</p>\n<p>Tip! Just like the original Asteroids!, objects can wrap from one side of the screen to the other.
