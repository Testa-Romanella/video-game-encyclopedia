You'll use the crank to rotate the ship; turning the crank clockwise will rotate your ship clockwise, and turning the crank anti-clockwise will rotate your ship anti-clockwise, because doing it the other way round wouldn't make sense.\u00a0You must navigate your ship through gates without crashing into them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I realise while writing this that the name of the game may be misleading, as the objective of the game is to not crash into the gates. I apologise for this, and those responsible have been fired.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Gatecrasher is also available on\u00a0iOS and\u00a0Android.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T14:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae5fd3e20b5ffb73568a51cd31cfaf6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benzgrant"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
