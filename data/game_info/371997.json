It is a game about sifting through the memories of our lives together. It is about revisiting the past, and making meaning for ourselves there.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What inspired this game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Recollection </em>is inspired by K-pop songs yearning for something lost. It is inspired by a belief in a  history made up of little moments. That a grand narrative can be composed of all the times we fell in love.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How do you play <em>Recollection</em>?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In <em>Recollection, </em>we<em> </em>play out scenes from our memories together, collaboratively interrupting, correcting, and rewriting the past. As we play, we are also guided by an oracle deck, giving us additional tools towards remembering what has passed.<br/></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, we generate characters together, determining both how our characters got together, and also what led us to drift apart.</p>\n<p>The rest of the game is a process of discovery, as we remember what happened between all of our characters, and what we learned, ultimately, about love, together.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Recollection</em><strong> </strong>is a 2-5 player game. It plays in about 2-3 hours.\u00a0It is GM-less. It requires a deck of playing cards.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is a submission to Jammi Jam Jam!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Recollection</em> owes much to Jammi Nedjadi's <strong>Stories of Love in Manila</strong>. It also owes much to Ben Robbins' <strong>Microscope</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1ecff6b777d42f1675eb3eaa855af86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kazumi Chin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
