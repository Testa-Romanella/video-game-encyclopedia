I would be very grateful if you let me know about the bugs you found, thanks in advance for helping with development and just for playing my game :3</p>\n<p><strong>LORE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is a slight semblance of lore in the game, but it is not served directly and it may be difficult to understand it. It is also worth noting that since this is a demo version, a lot of the game will not be explained.</p>\n<p><strong>FULL VERSION RELEASE:</strong></p>\n<p>if you are interested in the game and you want to play the full version, then its release will take place in the summer of 2022. But since I am working on the game alone, the game will probably be released at a later date, but it will definitely be released in 2022 :&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>also after the release of the full version, I plan to further develop the project. As far as possible, I will release DLC to the game and patches.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba37ecd50920d33f9a753f1063af480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Project Future"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
