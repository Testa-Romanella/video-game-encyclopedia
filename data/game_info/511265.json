Enjoy different musical and graphical themes, as well as some minor puzzles as you progress through the worlds.</p><p>Exoterrestrial is a game inspired by this game jam's theme, and started out as a small sample test.\u00a0I\u00a0began developing it late, about 5-6 days after the jam started, and over time, I added more and more to it all the way up until the submission date.</p>\n<p>It's a small demo of a walking-simulator/exploration game where you take the role of an astronaut travelling from planet to planet between slipgates. Since the theme was 'A Different Planet', I\u00a0thought of travelling to a different planet for each level of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming\u00a0 by https://mark-kawucha.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Art\u00a0 by\u00a0https://bearson.itch.io/\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0https://mark-kawucha.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Music by https://soundcloud.com/kami-oh</p>\n<p>Royalty-free sound obtained from freesound.org</p>\n<p>Royalty-free\u00a0font obtained from dafont.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:05:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c20c16eed32e1c8abab8df7cd50d482e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MKStrandholm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
