You are Fried, an adventurer tasked by the Royal Library to stop these monsters.  Traveling through dungeons alone is no fun, so make sure to recruit from the 16 different heroines willing to join you on your quest!  Each heroine can be assigned subclasses, and from there branch into even more powerful classes.  Form your strategies around those team members, as that will be key to winning your battles!<br />\nDangers lurk around every corner.  Normal fruit-shaped monsters are a cinch, but how will you fare against the more powerful monster girls?  Defeat them in battle and you\u2019ll get to seal them away in a book.  However, these books are more than they seem, as they take on the special properties of the sealed monster and boosts up your whole party! Collect all the books to survive.  But don\u2019t forget the essentials of dungeon traveling: strategy, heroines in your travel party, and monster girls ready to be sealed into books.<br />\n1 player(s)<br />\n2048KB Minimum<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
