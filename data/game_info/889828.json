The game is still very much unpolished and quite far from what I wanted to accomplish, so expect some bugs and issues, sorry! Also I know it can be confusing but generally main goal of the player is to always find the axe to move forward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T21:25:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9fe4680e348e5c69af0d2a64d9308b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tystnex"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
