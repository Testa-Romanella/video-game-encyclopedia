It has been an amazing help in combating both. Its pre alpha but you get the feel.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I designed this game to be picked up and put down at any time. It requires no serious time to complete. Each level is standalone with a few features that carry over between scenes that hopefully add some character to the game.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I programmed this in c# and 3D modelled everything in the game myself using Blender, except for the trees (Which I am currently making) and used a combination of my own textures and free commercially licenced textures to make the world feel like real life. I have credited all the authors for the textures used in the credits section.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Although I made this game myself, I had a lot of love and support from my friends, I had help bringing Paul to life with the help of my amazing actor friend Andy. Also I learnt to program in HTML and CSS with the help of my best friend Tony.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:50:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/0595b06e3e901be9fd5205ae14350c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlphaPhases"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
