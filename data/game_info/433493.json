Keep an eye on your energy, because shooting and colliding with aliens reduces your energy. Once it turns zero, you won't be able to shoot and a single hit will kill you. Luckily, shooting aliens tend to drop an energy booster, which will replenish your energy if picked up.<br/></p>\n<p>There is no music because I couldn't find a decent royalty free music to use in the game. The sound fx I've generated using Bfxr. All of the crappy art (except background) was done by yours truly.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Since this is my first ever gam jam (let alone Ludum Dare) entry, please be gentle. <br/></p>\n<p>Despite the simplistic nature of the game, I hope it's fun even if only for a brief while.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to rotate and shoot</p>\n<p><em><strong>Browser + Windows builds available.<br/></strong></em></p><p>Changes:</p><p>*\u00a0Fixed spelling mistake in the main menu (you're -&gt; your).<br/>*\u00a0Added windows build.</p>\n<p><strong>Other credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Space background:<br/>https://itch.io/queue/c/322720/space?game_id=217389</p>\n<p>Fonts:<br/>Orbitron Black, SaucerBB from https://www.1001fonts.com/science-fiction-fonts.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a060e084604635143d5b097f24fb2657.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KnightOrc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
