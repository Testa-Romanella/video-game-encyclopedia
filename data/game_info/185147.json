Super short, rough, buggy, unfinished etc. Sorry for the huge, windows-only build! I'm going to see if I can get iOS/linux builds working, but I can't make any promises that I'll have them available soon.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>There are three ways to make it past the second sign (and only the one for the first sign). None of them are as well communicated as I was hoping to make them, so I'll leave three hints below for folks who are interested but stuck.<br/></p>\n<p>Plays a little bit easier with a gamepad. Main controls are Left/Right shoulder buttons [or left/right shift] to slow down or speed up the camera, start [esc] to pause the game, and also all of the other controls!</p>\n<p>I made the mistake of thinking I could squeeze in\u00a0sound/music at the last minute, which just didn't work out, so there's no audio. :(\u00a0</p>\n<p>The state-saving system isn't totally iron clad. It might start getting a little mushy after numerous switches (especially if you're hopping way forwards/backwards) which can affect the game in weird ways.\u00a0You can reload the level if things start seriously misbehaving (pause-&gt;backspace).</p>\n<p>Engine is UE4; models made in blender; where there are textures (try and count them) they're free from poliigon\u00a0\u00a0(dont ask me about that entryway hardwood). Thanks to Oliver for help throughout!</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>Three spoilery secret hints :\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>here they come</p>\n\n<p>1. The\u00a0refrigerator!\u00a02. The super scary incoming storm!!!!\u00a03.\u00a0 Seeds need water!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n\n<p>Buffer zone for people who want to post comments but dont want to know secrets....</p>\n\n<p>Hello comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad161e3c76ef9a4459b5aa36bb1955e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["andrehupe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
