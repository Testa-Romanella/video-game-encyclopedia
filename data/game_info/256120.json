Mancala games play a role in many African and some Asian societies comparable to that of chess in the West, or the game of Go in Eastern Asia. <br/><br/><br/>Features: <br/><br/>1.

Players take turns to sow. In the process of sowing, all the seeds from a hole are dropped one-by-one into subsequent holes in a motion wrapping around the board. When one player no longer has any seed in his holes, the game ends. The player with the most seeds in designated hole wins the game. <br/><br/><br/>***************************************************** <br/><br/>Fatbird is greatly honoured to bring you Mancala \u2013 Deluxe HD and will continue to add new features, please don\u2019t hesitate to rate us, we love to see your support and suggestion! <br/><br/><br/>Fatbird also brings you other games: Ludo, Checkers, Tic Tac Toe, Gomoku, Dots, Othello, 4 in a Row, Chess, Backgammon <br/><br/><br/>***********************************<br/>If you love FatBird Games, please:<br/>Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FatBirdGames<br/>Follow us on Twitter: @FatBirdGames", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b14a1cfde135256690500755091cf8b.jpg", "website": "http://www.fatbirdgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fat Bird Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family"], "publishers": ["Richard Lee"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
