David Gunderson. He\u2019s a 35 year old scientist and he had a plan. He was going to turn everyone into zombies by giving them black and green striped candy that he made himself. The reason he\u2019s doing this is because everytime he tried to get candy as a kid, he would always get sour patch kids, only candy he hates. At the age of 14 he stopped trying and spent Halloween at home. He wants to get revenge for always getting the wrong candy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/cee0d612453ab979a5be5ed34ae50ef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bernardstrachan", "BeanGod", "SlyWasHere"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
