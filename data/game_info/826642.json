You even had prototypes in the works of personality driven AI that could remain loyal. However, a general in the military turned traitor and ran with two of the prototypes. It wasn't for a lack of effort that he couldn't take the third however, as being the first of the three you had apparently made her more loyal to you than anyone else. Unfortunately, he had a backup plan and swapped out her combat training data for dummy data, and fully unlocked her emotions. You had to spend the next few month getting her to a state of relative stability as the full range of emotions wasn't ready to be unleashed yet. During that period, the war rapidly turned against your nation, to the point where the opposing forces has reached the final viable chokepoint to defend. The AI while stable, outright rejects anyone else but you piloting her. So as the last defense, you must pilot Lindwurm against the waves of the opposing army. <br/></p>\n<p>Dev notes: Or, it would be like that, but I can\u2019t really call this a game since a lose state doesn\u2019t really exist and combat barely exists as it is.. I really debated uploading this, but I still went ahead with it if only as a statement to myself of the learning pains of trying to develop a game in a limited amount of time as we as the mistakes I made and the time I ended up wasting. And doing stuff at last minute late at night when I really should be not.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Ahimay's Twitter(give her love for Lindwurm's bust) https://twitter.com/ahimaysokamu<br/></p>\n<p>HeartBeasts' RPG tutorial:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn1JgK_mavg7ym6nvchF9Yjb<br/></p><p>GGBotnet's Ava font:\u00a0https://ggbot.itch.io/ava-font<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T14:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d2dbcf079edb4c7f38a926e0b9cf80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JetDungeonDragon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
