But she doesn't know her journey is just begining and a new adventure awaits her, along with the strangest and wicked characters she have ever met.<strong>The Characters</strong><br/><br/><strong>Erin:</strong><br/><br/>A weirdo who refuses to kill her foes, so she goes around doing weird stuff like cutitng their clothes off or crippling them for life. She thinks she doesn't have enemies, only potential friends. Erin fears stupid things like rainbows and butterflies. She love videogames, but really sucks at them.<br/><br/><strong>Rina:</strong><br/><br/>A greedy little thing who would betray her mother for the right price (if she had a mother). Erin and Rina agree to find together the witch's treasure, but they end up involved in a much bigger deal. At the end of their journey, she may find that the real treasure, is friendship... pfffff! of course she doesn't!<br/>Most people asumes she's a fairy, a sprite or an imp, but the truth is unkown.<br/><br/><strong>Star:</strong><br/><br/>Erin's adoptive sister, she's also her \"best friend\". Her usefulness doesn't go beyond letting Erin save the game every time she calls by phone. She hides her insecurities by wearing provocative clothes. <br/>Star loves animals, specially kittens. Like Erin, Star is a videogames fan, her favorite franchise is \"Acid Princess Durazno\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>ShyGirls:</strong><br/><br/>While they call themselves bounty hunters, the truth is, they are just a bunch of good for nothing bandits who go around looking for the ultimate treasure. Their attire comes from a misinterpretation of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale.<br/><br/>If you want to know more characters, better play the game. You don't want me to spoil everything here for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60e53f382546d6f609ec932954bda459.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/ErinyeGame/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 106}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karosu-Maker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Karosu-Maker"], "esrb_rating": null}
