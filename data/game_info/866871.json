Recently, a young sun goddess has discovered the isle, and seeks to claim it as a site\u00a0for her first temple.\u00a0 Luckily the moon is your patron.\u00a0 <br/><br/>With the power of a mystical plant called Ether, the Lady of the Moon\u00a0can stave of the encroaching daylight.\u00a0Send your people across the land to collect Ether from nearby farms. If you can procure enough extra Ether, she will accept some in exchange for additional boons. Be careful though, if you ever run out, nothing will stop the deadly dawn.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>- Hold Left Click &amp; Drag to select vampires<br/>- With vampires selected, Right Click a location to send them there<br/>- Send vampires to farms to collect Ether<br/>- Click the Moon Goddess to spend Ether for Boon Cards</p>\n<p>A Jelly Fountain Game:<br/>- Wyatt Senalik (Lead Programmer)<br/>- Eslis Vang (UI Programmer)<br/>- Bryce Cernohous-Schrader (Gameplay Programmer)<br/>- Sam Smith (Environment &amp; Gameplay Artist)<br/>- Sunny Hanna (Character &amp; Menu Artist)<br/><br/>Sound Credits:<br/>\"Ambience, Night Wildlife, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of\u00a0Freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T10:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8616339d00c35dbf54e6ad864ed91fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NannoOnTheMoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
