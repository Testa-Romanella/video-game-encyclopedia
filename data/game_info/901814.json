Every time you ruin your word, you lose a heart. Lose all 3 and you're <strong>done</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>Press an option, and press the tick, to confirm your selection.</p>\n<p>For each word, there is a <strong>minimum length</strong> the word needs to be before it is acceptable. The xs after the current letters show how many letters are still needed.</p>\n<p>As soon as what you've made is both <strong>a word</strong>\u00a0and <strong>long enough</strong>, congratulations, you get a point! Now you get the start of another word to build!</p>\n<p>Get 10 points, and you win!</p>\n<p>Try chilled, regular, and difficult modes each day, and see how high a rating you can get! Words are rated based on their relative rarity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T06:24:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/156de483a415006760292b01c3338e55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["SKYLE"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
