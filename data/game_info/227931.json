You are in command of the US led UN amphibious force tasked with stopping the initial North Korean offensive before they control the entire peninsula. The second part of your mission is securing the lasting peace on the area by conquering the entire land mass of Korea - and if the Chinese Red Army crosses the border to Korea you have the authorization to engage them to push communist forces out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.<br/><br/>+ Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.<br/><br/>+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.<br/><br/>+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.<br/><br/>+ Challenging: Crush your enemy quickly and earn the bragging rights on the forum.<br/><br/>+ Settings: Various options are available to alter the look of the gaming experience: Change difficulty level, hexagon size, Animation speed, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL) and cities (Round, Shield, Square, block of hourses), decide what is drawn on the map, and much more.<br/><br/>+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.<br/><br/>+ Good AI: Instead of just attacking on direct line towards the target, the AI opponent understand encircling, smaller tasks, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you want to test this WWII game, a free 20-turn version is available<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password.

The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming mechanics TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any solo indie developer could dream of. If you have feedback about this board game series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth chat without the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if there is a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will get back to you.
