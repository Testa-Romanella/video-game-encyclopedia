You cannot interact with the world directly--only through commands which your bots execute. There are three types of robots: Builders, Miners, and Scavengers: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Build-Bots construct, upgrade, and sell towers. When you place a tower  from the shop into the world, a Build-bot must visit the site before the  tower can function.</li><li>Mine-Bots harvest stones, and deliver them to the crystal base. Stones are required to construct towers.</li><li>Scavenger-Bots pick up gold off the ground, and deliver it to the crystal base. Enemies have a chance to drop gold when killed.</li></ul>\n<p>You can click or hover over towers to see what they do.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Pause = Space</li><li>Change Game Speed = Tab</li><li>Toggle Fullscreen = F4</li><li>Quit to main menu = Esc (while paused)</li><li>Cancel a build, sell, or upgrade = Right-click it</li><li>Select Tower = Click it</li><li>Upgrade Tower = Click [Upgrade] while tower is selected</li><li>Sell Tower = Click [Sell] while tower is selected</li></ul>\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Enemies won't attack your bots, but they will attack your towers if they decide it's faster to go through them than around.</li><li>The stone-price of towers increases as you build more of them. Make sure to build enough mining bots!</li><li>You can sell and upgrade Rocks.</li></ul>\n<p>This was made in one week for the Pygame Community Jam 2 (4/1/21 - 4/8/21)</p>\n<p>The game has no sound because the planet they're on has no atmosphere~</p>\n<p>Made by Ghast with pygame / PyOpenGL. Full source can be found here.<br/>The base engine (which I use for all my pygame projects) can be found here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcf6e37f0812088c240cea22c161ae37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghast"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
