You will meet 6 Great ZenHeroes that will warm your heart with their fun adventures! Help ZenHeroes defeat their biggest enemy, the all-mighty Kremshteta! Kremshteta is a selfish Queen of the Villainous VinDome who wants to invade ZenDome's ZenMannor and sabotage Wowly's and Zumra's wedding ( Wowly's and Zumras's becoming Kind and Queen of ZenDome ceremony). For sabotage technique, Kremshteta decided to steal ZenMannor's power source, The Goop. Kremshteta used some kind of black magic to drain ZenMannor's power and put the fuel (Goop) in silver buckets and spoons. Clumsy as she is, Kremshteta somehow dropped all of those Buckets and Spoons filled with Goop all around the ZenDome. To restore the ZenMannor's fuel source, ZenHeroes must unite and collect all of those Buckets and Spoons filled with Goop (known as GoopBuckets and GooSpoons).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Join ZenHeroes, their adventures, and the journeys through the ZenDome!</p>\r\nThis Game is still in development, so it's not finished and bugs and glitches can occur.
