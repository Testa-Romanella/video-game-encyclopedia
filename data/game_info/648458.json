The result is Harold VS the RPG. Play a very short Visual Novel game where Harold and Valerie don't really want to be there, and neither does the narrator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along the way you will encounter:</p>\n<p>-Sample maps! As the mapping team is on strike.</p>\n<p>-Harold at 20x normal size. Because why not?</p>\n<p>-An epic plot between good and evil and (ed: How did you write that with a straight face?)</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, the game is 5 - 10 minutes long.

Or at least get a laugh out of it. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:17:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a8ebde504ba2c432678792a5a772308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bgillisp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
