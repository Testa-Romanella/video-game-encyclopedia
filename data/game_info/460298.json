Therefore you've to seek for fishes. The minimap will tell you where they're swimming around. In order to catch one you have to go to jump into the water.</p>\n<p>But don't stay to long in the water or you will get killed. And take care that your baby is not running into the water. It will die instantly which means: Game Over. </p>\n<p>In order to avoid this just be nearby your baby and click [F]. Then you can pick it up and place it somewhere else. But only on ice!</p>\n<p>At that point just one more hint: you can only carry one thing at the time. So either your baby or a fish. That means: While you have picked up your baby you can not catch any fishes.</p>\n<p>Goal of the game is to catch as many fishes as possible within 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>Check out other ice floes. There you will find collectables which will refill the ocean with fishes.</p>\n<strong>Why no web version?</strong><p>The reason is quite simple:\u00a0the game doesn't perform well on web. This game also was an experiment. The models I've created are way more detailed than in the games before.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T06:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfc/dfc66508dcf4d73d68fbf58b97eb28c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
