Trash80 provided the music used in Darwinia, all low-tech electronic sounds reminiscent of early videogames. Rest to Reset was written and performed on 4 GameBoys, and recorded live. I think it\u2019s beautiful.</p>\n<p>This game is intended to provide an experience that supports that music, with everything that happens in the game happening in response to something in the music. Like an interactive music video. Or like Audiosurf, but sculpted just for this one track. It\u2019s an experience rather than a challenge. Although you can treat it like a challenge if you want to \u2013 there\u2019s a score of sorts displayed at the end.</p>\n<p>You control a spacecraft as it launches from a planet and ventures on its first journey into space.
