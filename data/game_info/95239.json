Hey the game wasn't stupid but no!</strong></p><p>This game is all about control, you thought it was easy to fly as a bird? You were wrong. This game truly tests your manoeuvring skills, good timing and speed. Put your fingers to the test or be a lazy guy and use a controller(don't use on(it's much harder(trust me(please)))) in a game where <em><strong>SPEED IS KEEEY!!!</strong></em> Customise your bird to look emo dark or angel white, your choice, I already made some ducks and what not.. But never mind that!! *Update* I made the bird go <strong>even faster</strong>. cool. My friends played this and raged because they don't have the true potential to be a bird. <strong>Do you have what it takes?</strong> Try now. (actually paying for this game is really nice and helps me in real life) Thank you.</p><p>Gamejolt - http://gamejolt.com/games/birdies/84784</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ecbeea41545d2f1cc2d133d97bfb177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Robin"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
