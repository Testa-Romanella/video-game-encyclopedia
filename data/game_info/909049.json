Sickle in your hand, you remembered your exit from afterworld. This sickle... It demands souls. Fill it.</p>\n<p>Harvestile is a simple strategy/card game in which, as a Reaper, you need to harvest 1000 souls from towns on the map! To do so you have to place buildings around towns that will weaken or strengthen them. This will either speed up or slow down the process. Beware! If you harvest too much, you might destroy a town and you won't get any souls from it. Destroying all towns before reaching 1000 souls will count as a loss! Take your time and have fun reaping!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81cb3c98fcf5f5b6f7967359d1434efb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["JamesBoink"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
