In other words, for me it was a 24h instead of 48h jam. I ended up with too little time for the actual game, none for sound and almost none for graphics (what you see are actually modified story cube images).</p><p>In game controls are left and right arrow keys to change direction, R to restart. Escape or Return also usually do something.</p><p>The Windows and OSX versions are untested, please tell me if the game does not run there.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/889dca2e1fe26625e25ecdbe518cacf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["murks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
