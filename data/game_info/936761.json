In the game you take control over Hoshi, a teenager who has problems with nightmares. To help Hoshi out, a familiar friend appears in the dreams - Shiki. Shiki is a star shaped cuddly toy from the real world, which will help you on your journey to end Hoshis nightmares. In every of the three levels you are faced with different fears of Hoshi (height, narrowness and darknesss). But don't worry, Shiki will be able to help you out - with her abilities and also emotionally. <br/></p>\n<p>The game was created as part of a university project, so feel free to give us feedback!\u00a0<br/><br/>Greetings from the Devs <br/>Laura &amp; Luke</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: <br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em><br/></p>\n<p>Run Left | <em>\"a\"</em></p>\n<p>Run right | <em>\"d\"</em></p>\n<p>Jump / Climb vine | <em>\"w\"</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Shikis abilities:</em></p>\n<p>Spawn vine |<em> \"q\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>Protect Hoshi | <em>\"e\"</em></p>\n<p>Shine | <em>\"r\"</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Dialog / UI interaction:</em></p>\n<p>Talk to Shiki (open / continiue dialog) | <em>\"spacebar\"</em></p>\n<p>Activate menu buttons &amp; Hoshis answers | <em>\"left mousebutton\"</em></p>\n\n<strong>\ud83d\udc1b KNOWN BUGS: <br/><br/></strong>\n<p>- <em>Enemies</em>: With the opponents it can happen that a calculation is not done correctly and Hoshi jumps through the opponent. <br/>Hoshi should actually defeat this opponent. However, the enemies' attack is prioritized and Hoshi is dealt damage incorrectly.  </p>\n<p>- <em>Checkpoints</em>: If you reach a checkpoint and play normally in the level or finish the level, there are no problems. <br/>But if you pause within a level and go back to the start menu through the dialog and then restart Somniphobia without quitting, <br/>you will find yourself at the last save point in the middle of the level without the previous item count. </p>\n<p>- <em>Dialog</em>: Within the first dialog of the level the button of the last selected dialog option is always highlighted. </p>\n<p>- <em>Climbing mechanic</em>: At the end of the vine you can force a higher jump if you press the \"w\" key frequently here.</p>\n<strong>\ud83d\udc9c SOURCES &amp; FURTHER ATTRIBUTIONS (sorted alphabetically):</strong>\n<p><em>Graphics and Animations: </em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Background Winning Dialog: Image by vector_corp on Freepik. </li><li>Bases for Hoshi's Sprites: Image by @bakawasemi / invidens on deviantArt. </li><li>Enemy Sprites and Animations: Assets from the Unity Asset Store.  </li><li>Item Design + Animation: Assets from OpenGameArtUi.
