{"id": 443658, "slug": "shape-hunter", "name": "Shape Hunter (itch)", "name_original": "Shape Hunter (itch)", "description": "<p>Shape Hunter is a 2D platform game inspired in the aesthetics developed by graphic artists and designers of the early years of the Bauhaus. <br/></p>\n<p>The player controls a white acrobatic character, whose goal is to advance through the levels under time constraints (initially 100 seconds, as an homage to Bauhaus anniversary) to get to the portal leading to the next. On her way, different obstacles and perils are in place, as well as a series of collectables, represented by the basic geometric shapes (circle, triangle and square) in different combinations of outlined or filled, and the primary colours. Each element has its own effect: speed up, slow down, add and reduce time, open and close gates, add points, or teleport. On occasions they are helpful, on others they add difficulty to the task.</p>\n<p>The character will have to run and jump over planes, angles and curves, in a landscape made of geometric overlapping shapes, drawn out of 20th century posters. The colour scheme of each level is composed by shades of a single plane tone, giving the scene a minimalist but bold feel.</p>\n<p>The bright palette and comic character animation go together with upbeat music and whimsical sound effects, coming together in an uplifting and enjoyable game.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by students using Unity in the <strong>8-Bit of Bauhaus</strong> project module of the\u00a0 Bauhaus-Universit\u00e4t Weimar, mentored by M.F.A. Gianluca Pandolfo. It was presented in the Open-Labs of Bauhaus' Summaery 2019. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Authors</strong><br/>Chanadda Janthivanont<br/>Pik Ying Lo<br/>Irene L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708f1ba6eaca0634388456541375c9a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Shape Hunter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
