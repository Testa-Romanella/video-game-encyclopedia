But once there, he finds more than he bargained for... For within these walls, madness lies.. And it is beckoning him inside.</p>\n<p>Madness Beckons was supposed to be a grandeose eldritch horror game where you walked through the Sunken City of R'lyeh, domain of Cthulhu, but due to time restraints I had to turn that down to an insane asylum. The game may feel a bit rushed, but I hope you will enjoy playing it all the same.</p>\n<p>Credit for relevant assets is given in game.<br/><br/>Update: Due to some mentioned errors, I have uploaded the newest version at our company website: http://unuslupus.com/files/brackeysgamejam2021/Madness%20Beckons%20(Windows).zip</p><p>For reviews it is still recommended you download the itch.io version for the initially submitted version.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7dd124ef0d8e826818a4ba5db2dfa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnusLupus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
