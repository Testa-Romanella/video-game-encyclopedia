{"id": 51891, "slug": "christmas-at-morleyville-mall", "name": "Christmas at Morleyville Mall", "name_original": "Christmas at Morleyville Mall", "description": "A different take on the horror genre, Christmas at Morleyville Mall lets you choose from a variety of roles with a varied degree of haunted activity: store employee, Food Court worker, chef, maintenance guy, or paranormal investigator.  Either switch between roles or try to make it as far as possible as a single character in the ... unique... business environment which Morleyville Mall offers.<br/><br/>Granted, there have been a few unexplained occurrences in the building. Staff complain about apparitions, disembodied voices, poltergeist activity, people being crushed by falling mannequins or Big Baby Bob Five-Foot Beanbag Plushies (tm). Waitresses in the Gnibbling Gnomes Family Restaurant complain that the \"gnomes are (g)naughty at (g)night\", whatever that means. Burger-flippers in the Food Court claim that someone else flips their burgers, usually on the floor. Customers sometimes run screaming from stores claiming to have seen a \"dark figure\".<br/><br/>The mall management has issued the following statement: \"Management asks everyone to remain rational. Ghosts do not exist, mannequins do not fall unless someone pushes them over. Teenage pranksters are the likely cause for many of these incidents, in fact security has caught several such hooligans. Other incidents have obvious natural causes. For example, the giant Big Baby Bob Five-Foot Beanbag Plushies (tm) are so abnormally large and tippy that they will inevitably topple over on occasion, especially when store clerks insist on placing them on the topmost shelves. Claims of apparitions and voices can be attributed to bad indigestion from people eating too much in the Food Court, although we are obviously not discouraging anyone from enjoying the delicious food there. But the public should rest assured that the mall is a safe and fun place to shop, socialize, and dine, as well as a great place to run a business.\"Key Features:<ul><li> First-person 3D gameplay. <br/></li><li> Multiple roles. Play as a paranormal investigator, store employee (preparing food, stocking shelves, putting up Christmas decorations, etc) and other roles. <br/></li><li> Variety and replay value. Randomly-generated paranormal activity, hidden items, and secret areas insure a different experience each time.<br/></li><li> Detailed setting with a history. There are dozens of stores and a backstory for the location.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942b793a0b577b15275a8d07fe0d6f10.jpg", "website": "http://www.starving-indie-developer.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StarvingIndieDeveloper"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StarvingIndieDeveloper"], "esrb_rating": null}
