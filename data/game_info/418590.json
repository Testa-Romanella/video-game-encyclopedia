This was one of those projects that fell through after I realised my concept didn't work entirely. I was focused on the message, which I still think is very powerful and could still be done, but with my limitations and development knowledge I was not able to achieve what I wanted. Although this game did not come to fruition I think it's important to show poor attempts too.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Death Sphere:\u00a0\u30df\u30ce\u30ab\u30ba\u30e4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e27/e276245c77e168f92fa032765460b57a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reece L Jones"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
