Check it out!<br/>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-S7nP-ojqo&amp;amp;list=PLjQh_Yi8CoBzW3k1QavOOaseD7XeN_xK_<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEver wanted to learn vector calculus? <br/>\r\nSee some crazy parametrized functions? <br/>\r\nDid newton invent or discover calculus? Are we living in a simulation? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThese are all questions this VR experience may be able to answer. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCalcflow is here. Open your mind to mathematics. <br/>\r\nExplore the secrets to the universe. <br/>\r\nEverything starts with the math. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCalcflow features intuitive ways you can learn the foundations of vector calculus. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can finally explain the complexities of vector calculus to your friend! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nManipulate vectors with your hands, explore vector addition and cross product. <br/>\r\nSee and feel a double integral of a sinusoidal graph in 3D, a mobius strip and it's normal, and spherical coordinates! <br/>\r\nCreate your own parametrized function and vector field! Don't worry, if these mean like crazy mumbo jumbo, you can always explore some of our awesome presets and sample problems! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also create your own notes while you're exploring these amazing mathematical properties! Simply push the track pad and write away in 2D or 3D!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-02T12:06:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38ebc6f887a622ae95bdb5cf86f54010.jpg", "website": "http://www.calcflow.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 104}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nanome"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["Nanome"], "esrb_rating": null}
