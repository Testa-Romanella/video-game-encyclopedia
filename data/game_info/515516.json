So he called in someone to help him. Maybe YOU can help the recipient reach the goal?</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>THIS IS JUST A PROJECT FOR MY COLLEGE CLASS!! SO OF COURSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE BEST QUALITY!!</p>\n<p>1) I don't know how to get rid of Unity-chan's menus. They were beyond the skill level I had at the time of making this, and I SEVERELY underestimated the aspects of the asset.</p>\n<p>2) The invincibility item on LV4 is implied to the player tip-toeing at such fast speeds, movement's not an issue. That's why there's no animation</p>\n<p>3) Credits at the end. Violet Beauregarde (Willy Wonka, Roahd Dahl); this credit piece is the one thing I forgot to include.</p>\n<p>4) I was concerned w/ functionality over aesthetic. So there was no enemy animation. Also past my current skill level.</p>\n<p>5) Apologies for the tiny UI text. They were normal-sized in-engine, and I don't know what happened.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c6/4c646b6928edcb205db3cb60d4395310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Living Glitch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
