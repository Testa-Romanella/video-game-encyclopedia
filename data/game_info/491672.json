However, this brought an enormous task of disarming several planets and satellites.<br/><br/>During the work on Titan's moon (<strong>on Saturn</strong>), the central computer (<strong>the \"Tupan\"</strong>) of the \"Anhanguera\" base understood that the war is not over yet and began the sequence of launching ballistic missiles to various planets.<br/><br/>Now it is up to you to use a mechanical vehicle (<strong>the \"Lampi\u00e3o\"</strong>) and disable all defenses on that base and stop the attack, even if it means having to make way with the use of unnecessary force.<br/><br/>You shouldn't expect this to be an easy task, because the place is full of automated weapons (killer robots, missile launchers, traps ...), so get ready for a turbulent descent on Titan's surface.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18c/18c4a255073f6ea78edcedb5e73422c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.indiedb.com/games/havoc-runner", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drailton Lima de Andrade"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Guara Logic"], "esrb_rating": null}
