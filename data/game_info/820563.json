The rotation matters and a left/right rotation is different\u00a0from an up/down rotation. Depending on the combinations of turns, you\u00a0can end up at the same square with different orientations (think of a rubik\u2019s cube)! Thus it could be that only\u00a0one path is correct.<br/></p>\n<p>// Credits<br/>Creator: randomnes<br/>Audio &amp; Art: finagled together from\u00a0various asset packs.\u00a0<br/>Engine: Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/4648931b0e3ed2fc4145c707bc536dfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["randomnes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
