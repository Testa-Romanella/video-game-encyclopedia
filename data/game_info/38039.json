In the world of Crystal Core, you will follow the perspective of the protagonist Cao Zuo'an (cza) to launch a fantastic adventure.<br/>\r\nIn the open world of 3300*3300, there are all kinds of environments, such as desert, city, forest, underground city, ocean and so on. There are all kinds of organisms, such as pigs, chickens, cattle and sheep, and other ordinary creatures, as well as huge tentacles, stone people, mushrooms and so on.<br/>\r\nIn addition to the plot of the main task, you can also consume in the city's restaurants and tea shops, and you can do whatever you want on the streets, but you can't escape the sanction of the law. If you don't like the life of the city, you can catch fish all day at the lake or seaside, hunt in the woods, dig in underground caves, visit museums, attack strongholds in the desert and so on.<br/>\r\nThe operation of the game:<br/>\r\nWSAD: Mobile<br/>\r\nF: attack 1<br/>\r\nR: attack 2<br/>\r\nT: Attack 3<br/>\r\nNumber key 1: Place TNT<br/>\r\nNumber Key 2: Throwing Axe<br/>\r\nNumber key 3: assassination<br/>\r\nM: map<br/>\r\nE: interaction<br/>\r\nQ: left<br/>\r\nTab: Knapsack Interface<br/>\r\nEsc: pause<br/>\r\nCrystal Core is the second game I made by myself using Unity3D. After the release of my first independent game Home Land, I received a lot of comments, whether good or bad, and I am very happy.<br/>\r\nThe reason Home Land is no longer updated is that my source code is damaged, so I have to put the feedback from Home in Crystal Core.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T02:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/980/980f49adfaedb2de41ad7fab6d35ae09.jpg", "website": "http://crystalcore.crystalspace3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 436, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Core Team", "Z.A.Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crystal Core Team", "Z.A.Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
