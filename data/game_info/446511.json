Made by Rachel, Yiren, and Suyi</p>\n<p>A Day in\u00a0the Museum is a short 3D level about meeting up with your friend in a natural history museum.Your goal is to reach certain spots and find certain exhibition items inside the museum with the information given to you by your friend via text messages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This level is inspired by Rachel\u2019s experience of visiting The American Museum of Natural History. There, she found an amazing collection and specimens, but wasn\u2019t able to go through all of them because she spent most of her time trying to navigate around the museum due to the lack of guidance and organization of the space. Therefore, for this project we wish to create a visually stunning but also confusing level that can be both enjoyable and an overwhelming experience for the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The layout of the space is also based on the The American Museum of Natural History, as well as other similar museums and references from other 3D games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1045e4f5cd12c79135c8fc559e0e60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diaosuyidsy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
