{"id": 380877, "slug": "in-passing", "name": "In Passing", "name_original": "In Passing", "description": "\"We need to talk...\"<br/><br/>Those words shattered everything, ruined everything. Alone with your darkest thoughts, you find yourself in a waking nightmare. The world is broken, fragmented, and your memories inescapable horrors. Sinister whispers bombard you, the world nearly impossible to navigate, and creatures move in the shadows. As a voice you thought long buried goads you, a simple light shines. A glimmer. Hope.<br/><br/>In Passing is a first-person 3D platformer set within the confines of a broken mind. Undertake a harrowing journey of recovery, tackling the relentless throws of toxic thought as you make your way back through fragmented memories. Jump, dash, and race through a mind intent on destroying you, pushing against the insidiousness of depression. Duck out of the way of turrets, vault over chasms, run along walls, and re-assemble the shattered pillar of self at the center of the maelstrom of melancholy swirling around you. <br/><br/>Featuring striking visuals, a gripping tale of a broken mind, challenging platforming, and a beautiful soundtrack from Lucas King, In Passing challenges players mechanically and mentally. <br/><br/>With care and poise, even the most broken mind can be healed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T03:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/729/729b07a4c17576387a2a866944886325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CelleC Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CelleC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
