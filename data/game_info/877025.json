How is this game relevant to the theme?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The game explores renewal by telling Shiny's story of renewing traditions she took on from her ah mah as players engage in the traditional muah chee making.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What sort of experience/message are you hoping your game will bring across to the player?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To be a little more conscious of our relationship with traditions, how are we engaging with them (if at all), and a perspective on how traditions can transform with each generation.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why did you end up choosing the direction of\u00a0 your game?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I found the idea of collaborating with someone outside the game industry very appealing. I also like the idea of the muah chee making mechanics relating directly to the voice clips\u00a0being shared and adding that layer of resonance to the story. I'm also just hyped to feature a local business.\u00a0I tried Shiny's muah chee once and it was damn good, you can really taste the shallot oil \ud83e\udd24</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T11:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf0/bf08e4fcd67b5c151ff088ae3efc0450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zmcn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
