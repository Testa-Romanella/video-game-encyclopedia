Ongoing construction has brought chaos to the goose kingdom, and it\u2019s time to fight back. Coordinate bumbling flight physics to bonk construction workers on the head and force them to halt their work, but be careful! It is a well-known fact that geese are bloodthirsty creatures, so the construction crew has come prepared with defenses. Dodge attacks from foes, don\u2019t hurt your allies, and battle to be the supreme goose!\r\n</p>\n<p>Goose on the Loose is an action platformer inspired by Yoshio Sakamoto\u2019s Balloon Fight for the NES. 1 to 4 players choose a Goose and duke it out on the many construction sites of George Mason University. Watch out for disgruntled workers, thrown tools, electric shocks, and other Geese as you navigate through the treacherous levels. Get the most points by killing the most enemies, surviving the longest, and not hurting your fellow Geese brothers to become the ultimate Goose king of GMU.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goose on the Loose:</strong> Goose on the loose was originally designed for a Winnitron cabinet but is available to play on PC using the controls listed.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>4 selectable characters: </strong>The four characters that you can select are different types of geese, player is the white goose, player two is the Canadian goose, players three and four are the blue and green geese.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Become the Goose King:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Collect powerups to recover lost health and to stay in the fight longer and to outlast your rivals.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Stomp some heads and kill enemies to earn points and to outplay your rivals on your quest to becoming the Goose king of GMU.
