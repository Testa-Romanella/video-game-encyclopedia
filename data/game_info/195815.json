You might not make it out of this alive but you're gonna give em hell before you go!</p>\n\n<p>Explanation:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aliens can drop fuel cans. Collect the fuel cans and refill your generator to power your turrets. Turrets increase fuel consumption while activated. You\u2019re going to need to use them to survive but you also have to make that fuel last because you\u2019re gonna need it! Generator health and fuel bars are on the top right. If it runs out of health or fuel the turrets shut off. Add in more fuel and you can activate turrets again as long as it still has health. If the generator is dead, you\u2019re on your own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/alien-swarm<br/></p>\n<p>controls:</p>\n<p>movement = wasd</p>\n<p>fire = left mouse click</p>\n<p>interact = e</p>\n<p>escape \u00a0toggles hide mouse</p>\n<p>mouse y axis tilts the gun up and down</p>\n<p>mouse x axis rotates player</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c708c793cd52daa5fd6f7e0adf5ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ox"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
