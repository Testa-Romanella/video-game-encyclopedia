{"id": 274545, "slug": "orb-defender-ld-43", "name": "Orb Defender (LD #43)", "name_original": "Orb Defender (LD #43)", "description": "<p><strong><em>Orb Defender</em></strong> is a tower defense game with a difference: the source of the power you use to defeat the waves of spawned enemies is the very thing you are trying to protect: the Central Orb.</p>\n<p>Drag individual orbs from the Central Orb onto a tower to power it up. You can attach multiple orbs to a tower, and doing so will increase the tower's attack strength and range. <br/></p>\n<p>You can then move orbs between towers, or indeed move them back to the Central Orb if need be. To move all orbs attached to a tower, left click and drag; to move a single orb, right click and drag.</p>\n<p>Do you sacrifice the strength of your tower arsenal, or the power of the Central Orb, in order to survive the longest, defeat the most enemies, and ultimately attain the greatest score? The choice is yours, but one thing is certain: <em>sacrifices must be made</em>!</p>\n<p>Created for Ludum Dare 43. Theme: <em>Sacrifices must be made<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Important note:</em></strong><em> I struggled to find enough time to dedicate to this project, so the game isn't as complete as I'd have liked it to be. Most notably, there's no audio, despite the fact that I actually <strong>did</strong> manage to create sprites for the sound button, which I then hid when I realised I wouldn't have time to implement any sounds. On Sunday afternoon, I was in two minds as to whether or not I was actually going to aim to submit, but in the end I wanted to share what I'd managed to create, even if it's not quite everything I'd envisaged!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f8fb9b059000c655813c3cab1a7cd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JoshyOshKenoshi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
