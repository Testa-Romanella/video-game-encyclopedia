Guard your base while trying desperately to tear down your enemy's. Good luck. <br/><br/>A new enemy has drifted in from the unknown and that enemy is...your friend!<br/>In a galaxy, so far and distant from Earth, is a battlefield where strategy is the name of the game.<br/><br/>This space fighting game features 3 galactic power-ups that will randomly appear on your side of the screen in lottery-style rotation. These power-ups will either be a nuke, a generator killer, or a wall breaker. The nuke will kill all enemy ships (YES!), the generator killer will basically destroy most upgrades that your enemy has done to defend himself (You what?!) and the wall breakers will penetrate straight through enemy ships leaving you a nice path to raid their base. The wall breaker will basically downgrade your enemy's wall one step at a time. These power-ups are a huge game changer!<br/><br/>Watch out for the wandering meteoroids that will collide into your spaceship throwing off your tactics or maybe just your enemy's. You can tap to destroy them which might help you save a wall breaker.<br/><br/>Grab a friend, cousin, sister, an assailant, brother, dad, grandpa, landscaper, local fast food employee, your mailman, or your enemy and press Ready! to take on the best strategy challenge of the day! Maybe even train your cat to play...the possibilities will only stop with your lack of imagination.<br/><br/>If you love this game make sure to review it and tell your friends to download it.<br/>Enjoy and thanks for downloading.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T08:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5504fc29123d849177f6258f131a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["FAD Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["FAD Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
