The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed.</p>\n<p>Portal, for the C64, was written by Myself, with Graphics by Del Seymour and Music by Roy Widding, all rights to the characters and storyline etc belong to Valve, this is purely a fan homage to such a great game.</p>\r\nHow to play...\r\n<p>Portal, for the C64, was designed to feel like a modern PC game, and so was designed with mouse and keyboard as the control method of choice.<br/>To play using a mouse you will need a 1351 Commodore Mouse (or compatible adapter etc) plugged into port 1.<br/>To play using a joystick, plug it into port 2.<br/>Either option you choose is purely to control the aiming, keyboard is always used to control Chell.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\nMouse Mode:\r\n<p>W=Jump<br/>A/D = Left/Right<br/>E - Action/Pickup/Drop etc<br/>Mouse Move = Aim Portal Gun<br/>Left Mouse = Fire Blue Portal<br/>Right Mouse = Fire Orange Portal<br/>Run Stop = Exit Level (you can start again from the last level)</p>\r\nJoystick Mode:\r\n<p>W=Jump<br/>A/D = Left/Right<br/>E - Action/Pickup/Drop etc<br/>Joystick Move = Aim Portal Gun<br/>Joystick Button = Fire Current Chosen Colour Portal<br/>R = Switch Portal Colour (this also happens automatically after shooting a portal)<br/>Run Stop = Exit Level (you can start again from the last level)</p>\r\nPlaying...\r\n<p>Navigate Chell (1) through each level, making your way to the exit point (2), there are a number of obsticles in your way and puzzles to solve, along the way you'll encounter switches (3) which will release your trusty companion cubes (4) you can use these to activate pads (5) which will open certain walls (9). they can also block the wayu of turrets (6) . there are also different kinds of walls, red ones (7) allow you to walk through but not shoot trough, green walls (8) can only be shot through, not walked through.\r\nGlaDOS will appear before every level to give some occasionally useful tips!\r\nAnd don't forget to keep a note of the level codes (10) so you can restart at that level next time you play.\r\nIMPORTANT: Portals can only materialise on the light grey blocks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba669bd84a2a57766212bcded92a656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamie Fuller"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
