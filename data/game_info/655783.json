I didn't have enough time to make the boss fight I planned, but the core gameplay is sort of there. The enemies respawn after a minute. Hover over things for tooltips and let me know how the gameplay feels. It was tough to make a game like this in a week and it was my first time using Unreal's AI and Navigation. Unreal Engine has a ton of weird stuff with how navigation gets generated so there are going to be places I missed masking out, but it should generally work somewhat well.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out the game.</p>\n\n<p>Many assets used from quaternius, some from\u00a0sakuyo,\u00a0yughues, and\u00a0LFA. on\u00a0https://opengameart.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0ded7c7511c5003e3b2ea45e712b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mattxm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
