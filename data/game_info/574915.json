The purpose of making this game was to better understand Twine and the interactive story process. That may sound simple, but it\u2019s true. I believe Twine is an incredibly interesting software with a ton of potential. I built this project so that I could explore everything Twine had to offer and really test it\u2019s ability as an interactive media software. I also wanted another portfolio piece, which this project helped with. With this project, I wanted to achieve a fun and interactive story that grips the viewers attention. I wanted to make something that was both funny and engaging. The game itself is a sort of parody of more serious choose your own adventure games. Instead of fighting an evil final boss, you fight the evil 7/11 cashier. I did this because I believe a parody like this would allow me to do more with the medium and allowed me to get as goofy or as outlandish as I needed to. In order to make the game engaging, I added several features. It keeps track of your name and what snacks you get and those pop up throughout the game. You can choose where you go, what snacks you get, and how you interact with the various enemies in the game. There\u2019s a mugging sequence where you have to trick the robber into not wanting to mug you by lying about what you have. There\u2019s also a final boss fight where you must successfully take down the evil cashier. Finally, there are photos on almost every page that help make your simple journey to 7/11 truly immersive. All together, I hope this creates an enjoyable, funny, and entertaining interactive adventure anyone can enjoy. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T03:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816e12ab38884c0029250baf6b4f96fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["smvgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
