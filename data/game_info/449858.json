We thought it would be cool to make a small 3D edition as our way of saying thanks for the support. This edition of worst tanks is close to being the same as the original edition with 3 extra tough 3D levels. As per the future of this edition it may receive few updates for levels or bug fixes however most likely this edition of the game will not be a replacement for the original edition.\u00a0We hope you enjoy the game.
