The theme for this jam is Delay the Inevitable. For this game, full screen is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>In this game, water is slowly rising around the island and you have to keep it from overtaking the entire island. If you hit the rising water, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to find sticks around the map and pick them up, and sell them in the pond at the top of the mountain. 1 stick sells for 1 coin, and you can buy super sponges which will automatically lower the water level surrounding the island for 2 coins per super sponge. Every time you use a sponge the water gets faster</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Shift to run</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>P to pick up sticks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12ede170345718297bc2a6016fe56901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["firescape games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
