Although it runs, the game is at very early development stage. Quite a number of bugs and features under intensive development are known to exist.</p>\n<p><strong>I have no experience playing the original KSP. Any comments/suggestions/feedback is highly appreciated!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ignition\u00a0</strong>is a space flight simulation sandbox physics game inspired by Kerbal Space Program aka KSP. \u00a0It is at a very early development stage at the moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Disclamer</strong>. <strong><em>It is totally realized it makes very little sense to try to reproduce even a small part of what has been made by huge KSP community. It is purely a hobby project and an attempt to learn something new.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Currently I have implemented</p>\n<p>1) Vehicle assembling.</p>\n<p>2) Player character can board/unboard a vehicle.</p>\n<p>3) Planet surfaces are procedurally generated.</p>\n<p>4) Planets move along perfect Kepler orbits.</p>\n<p>5) According to Matt Lowne and Scott Manley\u00a0in the original KSP\u00a0 a spacecraft is destroyed if it gets too far from a player controlled spacecraft. Here it is not the case. Spacecrafts physics is simulated regardless of how far apart they are.</p>\n<p>6) When in space a vehicle can either move along a perfect Kepler orbit (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic) or use numerical integration for some\u00a0boundary cases when Kepler motion equations degenerate.</p>\n<p>7) Planet orbits can be visualized for trajectory planning purposes.</p>\n<p>8) Time acceleration/deceleration. For now time acceleration works\u00a0up to x1000 and deceleration down to x0.1. Physics is simulated when time dilation is below x10. For time accelerations greater than x10 only planets move.</p>\n\n<p>TODO list so far.</p>\n<p>1) \"Map\" (zoom out)\u00a0mode in order to see the whole vehicle trajectory.\r\n</p>\n<p>2) Better lighting</p>\n<p>3) Atmosphere drag model<br/></p>\n<p>4) Spacecraft under control trajectory visualization</p>\n<p>5) Delta V points on a trajectory</p>\n<p>6) Realistic sounds<br/></p>\n<p>7) Better 3d models</p>\n<p>8) More planets</p>\n<p>9) Due to there is no problem with physics simulation for distant vehicles it is possible to implement multiplayer. However, so far I don't logically understand how to gracefully control time acceleration in the case of multiplayer mode.</p>\n<p>All controllable entities have a control group. It is selected in the menu window. The menu window shows up when an icon is clicked. Currently active control groups are in upper right corner of the screen.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Initially a character is controlled. In order to make in move it is necessary to pick a control group and select overlapping control group in upper right corner. For example, select character control group to be \"Group 1\" and also select \"Group #1\" check box.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls are W,\u00a0S,\u00a0A,\u00a0D for movements. Z,\u00a0X to change engine thrust. I, K, U, O, J, L for rotation control. Space bar\u00a0for engine on/off.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any comments/suggestions/opinions are highly appreciated</strong>!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/15129a53d3e4379ce0c73da10cf6da25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["litedictteam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
