A huge amount of challenges, objects and traps will keep you enthralled for a thousand years.<br />\nTo the natives the legendary Crystal Dragon was a myth. An evil sorcerer by the name of Ariath had spent a lifetime searching for the artefact, that would give him the ultimate power. He led his armies of darkness on a swathe of destruction in search of his goal, and many years later found a great beast inhabiting a vast cavern protecting his prize. Ariath reached out to touch the Crystal Dragon and the guardian awoke. A fierce magical battle ensued between the two rivals. Ariath won by he could still not fulfill his dream; he summoned all his powers to create a magical fortress to study and gain the secret that the Crystal Dragon held. One day he would have his reward and evil for evermore would become reality. Are you brave enough to confront him before the powers of darkness prevail?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-21T13:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d51c079336d8c7e48b3932d1f1bfada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Magnetic Fields"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Black Legend"], "esrb_rating": null}
