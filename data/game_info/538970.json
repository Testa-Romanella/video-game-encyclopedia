I started a bit late and the player controller script took me way too much time to get it working properly.\u00a0This is the 4th Jam that I finished and for the 4th time I have aimed way too high. That's why this game has bare bones, barely working gameplay loop. In\u00a0conclusion -\u00a0scope small and focus on the main gameplay loop first.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move - WSAD<br/>Quit - ESC</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game uses these sounds from freesound:<br/>\"FIREPLACE\" by leosalom\u00a0licensed under CCBY 3.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84c5322e0b8a6a40c8388cb69a488d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["V I R T U _"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
