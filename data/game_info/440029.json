{"id": 440029, "slug": "versatiles-final-demo", "name": "VersaTiles (Final Demo)", "name_original": "VersaTiles (Final Demo)", "description": "<p>VersaTiles is a unique puzzle rpg game inspired by games such as Pokemon, Tetris, and 2048 (game). Each turn, you select tiles on a 4x4 grid (16 tiles). All tiles are randomly generated, so pick your tiles wisely. You can select a tile and form a 4-tile sequence When making a sequence, the order in which you select them MATTERS. The sequence goes from left to right. Tiles can be used to deal damage to enemies, refill your HP (Heart Points), refill your CP (Command Points), or receive Commands. The player is given 25 seconds to form a sequence (the penalty timer can be turned off in the game). Once the timer reaches 0, if you haven\u2019t made a 4-tile sequence, the remaining selected tiles will be used.\u00a0After the player finishes their turn, each enemy\u2019s counter drops by 1. When it reaches 0, the enemy is given a turn to attack. When you defeat all the enemies, you move to the next wave. At the end of a level, you face off against a boss.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game\u00a0is to clear all the enemy waves without having your HP reach 0. If your HP reaches 0, it\u2019s Game Over.</p>\n<ul><li>5 levels (3 Jungle, 2 Casino)</li><li>5 unique bosses</li><li>Over 16 enemies</li><li>Simple level up system</li></ul>\n<p>Disclaimer:\u00a0 It's the final demo for my Video Game Design class. Currently, I have no plans of commercializing this game.\u00a0Any constructive feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:46:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/96695c82dae61f6865d4ee537c7bea77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamluigi"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
