It's an asymmetrical puzzle game where you control two soul-bound mages at the same time; each having different, but complementary abilities. The purple mage (controlled by the left side of the controller) has the ability to shoot orbs to activate switches, while the green mage (controlled by the right side of the controller) is able to generate a shield to reflect the purple mage's orbs and nullify dangerous projectiles.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe puzzles require you to use both characters in order to solve them. No one is left behind. You work together or you die together.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t This game was made in 48 hours during the 2nd annual Sudbury Game Design Challenge where it placed first. Rather than a traditional game jam where the contestants are given a theme or mechanic, we were given a title for our game and designed around it.
