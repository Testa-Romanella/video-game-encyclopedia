Climb a strange tower and its many floors and discover what lies at the top! Master the controls and mechanics while enjoying the detailed pixel art and the haunting soundtrack. Checkpoints are plentiful, but death is never far...</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>Each of the spire's floors ends with a fully illustrated story cutscene. What kind of story do they tell? <br/>I dunno. You tell me.</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>Game can be played with a keyboard or a xinput controller. <br/>It also features an 'invincibility' mode for people who don't want the challenge: just press the 'i' key on the keyboard to toggle it on and off!</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>The game is free because I want everyone to be able to enjoy it and can personally afford to have it that way for the time being. However, donations are immensely appreciated and will go towards future projects.<br/>The soundtrack is available for free as well: <br/>https://june-flower.bandcamp.com/album/washout-spire-ost</p>\n<p>Have fun dying a lot!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T05:07:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29dd194a8d572a7541af732d901c7a59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["June Flower"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
