Including advertising on social networks.<br/>After the company - there were zero downloads. And that's all. Nobody sees this game in the market. Nobody plays. And I only got one real review from a user. That download game, play, and says (in short): \"the game is depressive and I'm impressed\".. (or something like this).</p>\n<p>In the hope that absolute zero in downloads is some kind of error xD<br/>(Even if the game is the worst game ever made in-universe. Random and statistics, hello?)</p>\n<p>And here's the question.<br/>Will I give up? Not.<br/>Will you give up? Not recommend. And it's not just about the game =)</p>\n<p>This is not a standard game. Most likely this is a performance to support the \"NEVER GIVE UP\" principle.</p>\n<p>This game is aimed at making money.<br/>This game is just a creative act of sincerity with which I wanted to express some of my feelings and thoughts via visual sound effects and gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>PS (once more):<br/>Thanks if you read this.<br/>Thanks if you play this game.<br/>Thanks if you TRY to play xD (yeah sometimes game can be hard)<br/>Feel free to make reviews and leave comments.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>Vasiliy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad4f0487a663d0dcf55f64c2b6ebfe67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["foreverplane"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
