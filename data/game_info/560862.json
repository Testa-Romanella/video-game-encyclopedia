Unfortunately, planes overhead drop bombs that get buried on your island. You have from 8\u00a0AM until 5 PM to dig up all of the bombs and safely detonate them. If you're not quick enough or careful, you can blow yourself up.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Each level has 3 secret chests you can dig up. Each needs to be opened with a key you find buried, and each contains a unique item - a bomb shield, a bomb detector, and a health increase. It will be a good idea to check as many places as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/WASD - Move</p>\n<p>J/X - Interact, Dig</p>\n<p>K/C - Cancel, Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef8ab4e8571c712f9e29b312d6f6ddc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MetaphysicsStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
