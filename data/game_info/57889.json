It was re-released by Codemasters for the Game Boy Color in 2000. It was the first entry in the eponymous series and was followed by TOCA 2 Touring Cars in 1998. The player takes control of a driver who races for one of the eight works teams that contested the 1997 British Touring Car Championship against fifteen AI competitors on one of the nine championship circuits. A championship mode is available for players with the objectives of earning points to continue competing and unlocking new features.</p>\n<p>Development of the game began in 1996 and continued for the next eighteen months in which Codemasters worked closely with the British Touring Car Championship's organiser TOCA to faithfully recreate the series in the virtual world. The game features the former racing driver Tiff Needell as the commentator. Reception was generally positive with critics directing their praise at the gameplay and the excitement it gave the player. The game was a commercial success with 600,000 copies sold Europe in the first six months of its release and was ranked third in the United Kingdom video game charts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e7917df54d1d5d84e09b1472da289d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["THQ", "Codemasters", "3DO"], "esrb_rating": null}
