{"id": 675854, "slug": "genomancer", "name": "Genomancer", "name_original": "Genomancer", "description": "<p>You\u2019re a Genomancer, whose abilities are controlled by your unstable  genome. Your genome is composed of codons - the four elements, and a  stop codon. You can have up to 4 abilities, and passive effects. The  abilities are encoded by unique codon combinations, and any \u201cexcess\u201d  codons improve the ability.\r\n</p>\n<p>Kill endless waves of enemies, and every few levels, mutate - voluntarily or not!\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Move: WSAD\r\n</li><li>Ability 1: Left Mouse Button\r\n</li><li>Ability 2: Right Mouse Button\r\n</li><li>Ability 3: Q\r\n</li><li>Ability 4: E\r\n</li></ul>\r\nEffects on player:\r\n<ul><li>Earth: max health\r\n</li><li>Water: max mana\r\n</li><li>Fire: bonus damage\r\n</li><li>Air: movement speed\r\n</li></ul>\r\nEffects on abilitites:\r\n<ul><li>Earth: splash damage\r\n</li><li>Water: lower mana cost\r\n</li><li>Fire: bonus damage\r\n</li><li>Air: lower cooldown\r\n</li></ul>\r\nHere\u2019s the list of abilities, if you don\u2019t want to figure them out yourself (F: Fire, W: Water, E: Earth, A: Air, S: Stop):\r\n<ul><li>F - Fireball\r\n</li><li>FF - Fireblast\r\n</li><li>FA - Firestorm\r\n</li><li>FFF - Chaosbolt\r\n</li><li>W - Water Cannon\r\n</li><li>WW - Bubbles\r\n</li><li>WWA - Snowball\r\n</li><li>WA - Frostbolt\r\n</li><li>E - Earth Spike\r\n</li><li>EE - \u201cEarthquake\u201d\r\n</li><li>A - Wind Strike\r\n</li><li>AA - Hurricane\r\n</li><li>AF - Lightning Bolt\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>So, for example, if your genome is the following:\r\n</p>\n<p>FFW S WAA S EEEEEWW\r\n</p>\n<p>This means you have 2 abilities, and character passives:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fireblast with lowered mana cost\r\n</li><li>Frostbolt with lowered cooldown\r\n</li><li>50  health and 20 mana from the rightmost gene. Be careful, there is no base health or base mana. If you lose all earth  codons from your passives, you\u2019ll have 0 max health and die.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>So, how do mutations work? Every 3 levels (later on, every 2 levels) you can select a mutation:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>adding a codon - a new codon is inserted before your selection - probably the one you\u2019re going to choose the most,\r\n</li><li>substituting a codon - the selected codon is replaced by a new one,\r\n</li><li>removing a codon - the selected codon is removed,\r\n</li><li>inverting part of your genome - the entire part of genome between your first and second selected codon is inverted,\r\n</li><li>swapping 2 codons - two codons swap their places.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>You also mutate randomly every 3 (later on, 2) levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>Play now!<br/></p><p>\n</p>\n<p>---------------------<br/></p><p>Attributions:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>https://soundbible.com/653-Catapult.html\r\n</li><li>https://soundbible.com/1356-Flame-Arrow.html\r\n</li><li>https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/26012/ The Great Battle by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The  abilities and codons icons and the missiles images are not ours either,  but we\u2019ve made the wizard and the knight images and the floor.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:45:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["adventure_dev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
