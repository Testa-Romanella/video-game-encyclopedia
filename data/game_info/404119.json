I was passionate at the start but quickly lost interest at the end. I\u00a0usually just delete my projects, but figured I\u00a0actually got far in this, and just ended it. This game represents what I\u00a0see and think in my mind. It's also a Non-RPG RPG Maker game, so if you expect crappy basic RPG battles, you are wrong.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25a/25a6ef8f8c52a49470711fe124ba9be1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaminboi2864"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
