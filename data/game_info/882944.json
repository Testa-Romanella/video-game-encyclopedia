You don't have to stack three identical stones in a row, but on the contrary, remove obstructing stones so that the stones that fall as a result form a horizontal or vertical row of identical stones. The game has a timer. Your time is also reduced when you remove a row of stones, and also added when a row is counted by the game. With the growth of points, move to another tier of difficulty and get less time for counted rows. When the timer reaches zero your game will be over and the points will be reset to zero.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMinimal graphics<br/>\r\nRelaxed logic game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T03:45:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de105a1188ce3e47b3ba759311b21940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoMedia"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GoMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
