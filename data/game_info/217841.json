Just relax, chill out, de-stress, pop some bubbles and watch the other bubbles drift around the screen.<br/><br/><br/>2. For the more competitive out there - try and score as many points as possible by bumping bubbles of the same colour into each other. <br/><br/>For example if two yellow bubbles bump then you get a point. The faster they bump together the more points you score. Any score over 100 is good, but scores much higher are possible with careful planning and fast small bubbles.<br/><br/>Either way we hope you have hours of fun Popping Bubbles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f5/9f5609be2f3463d9e140644e50253dd7_uJECYF7.jpg", "website": "http://www.galaticdroids.com/bubblepopping.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Galatic Droids"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Gold 5"], "esrb_rating": null}
