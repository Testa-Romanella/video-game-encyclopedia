The catch is in traps that are standing on its way - you have to move left or right to avoid them. Your player moves on its own and all you have to do is control its jumps left or right.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLEVELS:<br/>\r\nLevels in this game are put together and they are visible in the difficulty of gameplay. The further you get - the harder levels are. The faster you move - the better your chances of success are.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraps include obstacles and loops, if you avoid all of them - you're at the edge!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f864589661f68137a3a6787895ecd03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silicon Echo", "Broadplay Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
