For one year, two teams of students worked on this project. During the first semester, there were Third Year and Second Year students on this project, but for the second semestre, there were only the Second Year students who worked on it.</p>\n<p>We had to do a <strong>prototype</strong> of the game. So we made a 5 min gameplay to introduce the differents mechanics to the client.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This project is a <strong>God Tactical Game</strong> in which the player can control a crowd\u00a0 full of protesters which are fighting Policemen. There is two ways of playing the game, you can lead your protest toward violence against the Policemen but you will not have the favor of the Journalist, or you can just protest peacefully without any\u00a0 damage caused. It's up to you to choose your way !</p>\n\n<p><strong>TEAMS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FIRST SEMESTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Producer</strong> : Julien Barande (Thrid Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Developper</strong> : Vincent Pettineo (Third Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Developper</strong> : C\u00e9dric Chauvin (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Designer</strong> : Pascal Galibourg (Third Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer</strong> : \u00a0Louis Erra (Third Year), Lucas Sanchez (Second Year), Timoth\u00e9 Courtier (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Graphist</strong> : Paul Meyer (Third Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Graphist</strong> : Eliott Tirant (Second Year)</p>\n\n<p><strong>SECOND SEMESTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Producer</strong> : Eliott Tirant (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Developper</strong> : C\u00e9dric Chauvin (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Developper</strong> : Victor Chiorean (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Designer</strong> : Lucas Sanchez (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer</strong> :\u00a0\u00a0Oscar Chenevier (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Graphist</strong> : Lo\u00efc Andriantsoa (Second Year)</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Designer</strong> : Timoth\u00e9 Courtier (Second Year)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T03:07:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e37d2f214a188b48fed34b8c4d2d7fcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["F4ilortrue", "Habide", "Cedric-chauvin", "Miaro", "Rouscar_IIM"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
