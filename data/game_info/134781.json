You play one month at a time with the goal to become the largest landlord tycoon in town. However not all is sunshine and rainbows. You will be forced to make difficult decisions between moral based problems. Do you decide to shut down your businesses during the weekend of JFK's assignation as a sign of respect? Or do you force your workers to come in because you might not have enough money to feed your family?</p>\n<p>How you will build your tycoon? Which shade of grey will you be painted on the moral spectrum?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game is for the Pizza Jam. The theme was movement. We took a different approach than most people. Instead of having say, a platformer with moving parts, we wanted to make a game about being a landlord where tenants move in and out. Cashflow in and out. Movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/3086e2be2f9f9acc5e8837c4db7c85ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LukeTrynchuk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
