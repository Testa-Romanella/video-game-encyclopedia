Slider's Intro from Animal Crossing on the Gamecube), but the rest of the music and art is completely original.</p>\n<p>Also for those unaware, the \"oombs\" are myself, jojo of @washbearzz, snail of @goobygaba, and mars of @dreamtdebrisall on twitter. Also, Ian refers to Ian Wright, the footballer. Again, this is littered with inside jokes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T19:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89aa03ce89bc2de18ddb59da4a0914b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["napcast"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
