I've been playing some JackBox games lately and was inspired to see what I could do.\r\n    <br/>\r\n    My secondary goal was to learn how to use JSON feeds. With a background in webdevelopment I have been itching to give it a try in Unity\r\n    <br/>\r\n    I am please to say that I succeeded on all fronts.
