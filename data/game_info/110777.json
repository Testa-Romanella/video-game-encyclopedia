This is the main premise behind the RITG story.</p><p>Instead of Austria GP, we have Mars GP. But the space travel is so advanced that the human race reached all the galaxy. A new championship was made where every year the best pilots of the galaxy are gathered on a <strong>huge spaceship</strong>.</p><p>This spaceship holds all the team manufacturers, staff people, pilots, journalists, and so on. It is <strong>like a city that moves from planet to planet every other week</strong>.</p><p>It is in this context that all the game events happens. There will be events occurring while you are on the ship. Industrial <strong>spies</strong>, <strong>saboteurs</strong>, and all that.</p><p>Every year the planets participating on the championship changes. The pilots never know what challenges expects them. (You can keep playing after finishing the championship)</p><p>Welcome to the Race In The Galaxy Championship.</p><p>TLDR; read the bold text.</p><p>The game can be divided into <strong>2 parts</strong>: <strong>Inside and outside the cockpit</strong>.</p><p>You will start your campaign creating your character. You will <strong>choose a name and appearance</strong>.</p><p>This character is not famous (yet), so you have to prove yourself on a minor championship (tutorial) in order to get attention from the big teams on the RITG.</p><p>(you can always skip the tutorial and go directly to the team choosing part)</p><p>In each new game, <strong>the teams will have different names, colors, logos, preferred car, and technology level</strong>. Depending on your difficulty settings, you will get a list of teams with more or less popularity and technology levels.</p><p>You will start as a \"secondary\" pilot, and sometimes you will be asked by your team to let your partner, the primary pilot, to finish in front of you.</p><p>Depending on <strong>your decisions to accept or disobey your team</strong>, and the different outcomes (get at first or last place, for example), your <strong>relationship with your team and partner</strong> will be altered.</p><p>These <strong>relationships</strong> will affect directly on the different <strong>random events</strong> that might happen between the races.</p><p>Eventually some other pilot will become your <strong>rival</strong>. This will be a character that will receive special attention on your <strong>interviews with journalists</strong>, and it will affect some random events, impacting on your <strong>popularity</strong>.</p><p>The game has a <strong>procedural technology system</strong>, and the way you get <strong>new techs</strong> is by <strong>keeping your team popularity high</strong>. This represents the money received from sponsors.</p><p>In order to gain popularity, you need to <strong>win races </strong>and <strong>stay out of trouble</strong> (or not).</p><p>Now, <strong>inside the cockpit</strong>.</p><p>The game will feature <strong>10 different cars</strong>, with different attributes.</p><p>These attributes are: <strong>Speed</strong>, <strong>Acceleration</strong>, <strong>Turning </strong>and <strong>Defense</strong>.</p><p>Each car will give you a <strong>unique way</strong> to play the game. You can try to destroy your opponents, keep your advantage on long straights, play carefully trying not to crash... It all depends on your <strong>attributes</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>skills </strong>and <strong>modifiers</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>The way you control your car is different from a normal racing game, because <strong>your car is floating on the air</strong>. You will have to <strong>think in zero gravity</strong>. If you stop accelerating and turn your car, it will keep going forward, until you accelerate again. This means that your break/reverse is a backwards impulse.</p><p>The game will feature <strong>car explosions and pilot deaths</strong>. Be careful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/8054a64478a894d0c176a2543e2abf22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Turtle Hearts"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
