The Gargantua is all about being in a body that doesn\u2019t seem to fit you at all. It\u2019s grown too large too fast and things are so much more awkward than when you were younger. Bumping into things is a minor worry compared to the destruction you know you can unleash. A type of destruction you may point inwards to spare everyone your clumsy attempts at being normal.</em></p>\n<p>The Gargantua is a Skin about growing up without growing wiser. Teenagers have bodies which often feel like they are betraying them in one way or another. The Gargantua has a body that many would envy, but they know the true pains of not being used to what is happening to them.</p>\n<p>This Skin for Monsterhearts 2 is about trading control for physical advantages, explore scenarios where your imposing nature can help and hinder you, and get pushed around by adults who still control you no matter how large you get.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/900f38bf89c48a3b612a0790f294f58a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
