Context turned around to find himself face-to-face with some sort of green 3-eyed generic alien dude. \"It seems you haven't payed for entry,\" the alien stated. \"And what might that be?\" Conhead said, feeling cocky. \"Why, your soul, of course!\" the alien exclaimed. \"Okay sure but let me just tell my mom to feed my cat real quick,\" Conhead said, unfazed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Ah, a spunky one, eh? I could use a little of that here,\" the alien said. \"How about this?
