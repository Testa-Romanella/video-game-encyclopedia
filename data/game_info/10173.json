{"id": 10173, "slug": "muv-luv", "name": "Muv-Luv", "name_original": "Muv-Luv", "description": "<p>The Muv-Luv series is an epic saga told in three parts: Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and Muv-Luv Alternative. What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it\u2019s this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you won\u2019t even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don\u2019t fall for Extra\u2019s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you\u2019ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you\u2019ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.<br />\nThis game contains the first two arcs: Extra, and Unlimited.<br />\nThe final arc, Muv-Luv Alternative is the story\u2019s massive climax, and is nearly the size of the first two combined.Muv-Luv Extra<br />\nTakeru is your average unassuming high school senior whose entire world gets turned upside down one morning when he awakens to find himself in bed with the heiress to one of the world\u2019s largest international conglomerates. She calls herself Meiya, and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who\u2019s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn\u2019t act fast, she might just lose him forever. All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he\u2019ll need to decide between the girl who\u2019s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they\u2019re bound together by fate.<br />\nBut that\u2019s only one side of the story.Muv-Luv Unlimited<br />\nJust as the page turns on Takeru\u2019s happily ever after, he awakens one morning in a world not his own. An alternate timeline, humanity on the brink of extinction. A world infested by alien invaders locked in a war that\u2019s been raging on for decades. And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still here, albeit dilapidated and barely standing. His school is still here, though it\u2019s now a military academy. And even though they don\u2019t recognize him, all his friends are here too\u2026 with one exception.<br />\nWas this all just a dream? Or was the world he thought he knew really a dream all along?Muv-Luv Alternative<br />\nTo avoid spoilers, we only recommend visiting Muv-Luv Alternative Steam page after finishing Muv-Luv Unlimited.Features:A Dating Sim - Date any of the heroines, get to know their personalities and backstories, and fall in love with each other!<br />\nAvailable in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.<br />\nThe User Interface has been reworked, so it&#39;s compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.<br />\nUser save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.Muv-Luv Reviews (Original AppID)https://steamcommunity.com/app/449830/reviews/?p=1&amp;browsefilter=toprated&amp;filterLanguage=all</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2003-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T05:51:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca5e0650fbae8d942621d1983a9b3eb8.jpg", "website": "http://www.muvluv.moe", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 150, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 10, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Pqube", "Anchor", "ixtl"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project", "Degica"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
