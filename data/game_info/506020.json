As you're heading to class, a mysterious man hands you a starter deck. Those cards have real power! Who knows what kind of strange things await on campus of the Card Game University!</p>\n<p>Inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh: Eternal Duelist Soul for the GBA - but with a Philosophy twist!</p>\n<p>Created in 1 week as a submission for the 3rd Philosophy Game Jam! The Game Jam Demo edition has the following features:</p>\n<ul><li>Select between 3 different decks - Greek, Psychoanalysis and Marxist.</li><li>Contains basic functionality for the card game.</li><li>Battle 3 different players - Thomas, Liz and Bruce.</li></ul><p>Because the game was made so quickly I didn't produce a tutorial, so here are controls/mechanics:</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>By default, the controls are:</p><ul><li>Arrow keys = move around</li><li>Z = Select</li><li>X = Cancel</li><li>A = Left Tab</li><li>S = Right Tab</li></ul><p>You can rebind the controls by going into %appdata%\\WhatIsPhilosophyAnyways and modifying the keyboard.json and gamepad.json files.</p><p><strong>Mechanics:</strong><br/></p><p>Each card has an attack and defense stat. When you select your main philosopher, you will attack with their Attack, plus the boost from any overlays they have, minus the defense of the opponent's main philosopher. After you perform your attack, you can switch your main philosopher with someone on your bench, at the cost of their overlay, if they have one. This way, you can switch to a defensive strategy while your opponent is attacking.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:</p>\n<ul><li>Machinic Unconscious Happy Hour Podcast</li><li>celibatevicky_</li><li>criticalfaerie</li><li>Liam C</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6fc80c009debb79261a13b2e54ebe76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punished F\u00e9lix"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
