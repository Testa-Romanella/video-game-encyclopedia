Little did I know, my first day would become a nightmare. I screwed up, and suddenly, everyone pointed fingers at me, blaming me for something I didn't do. It's not my fault, you know. It's like I stumbled into a place filled with secrets and lunatics. I despise this place, and I'm not too fond of the others either. Survival seems to be my only option now.<br/><br/><br/>Hmm... It's kind of hard to explain all the details, but I was forced to start at this new school. It wasn't by choice; my parents practically pushed me into it.

Well, you know how that turned out. Did you manage to contact my advocate? I have a feeling I'm going to need one.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, Beatrice, she was an absolute stunner! It's like I've never laid eyes on such breathtaking beauty before. And then there's Hitomi, the quiet, nerdy girl. She might be a nerd, but she's intriguing in her own way.

Veronica is on a whole different level; she can master anything through sheer dedication and hard work. But, my goodness, there's something about each of them that's utterly bewildering!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c9460022178deea5f4a659bde32b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alperen Torun"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alperen Torun"], "esrb_rating": null}
