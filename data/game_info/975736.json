Did your teacher give you a failing grade in math because you didn't know the area of the square? Then the best solution to relax is Bounce ASMR!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can simulate the movements and jumps of the geometric shape as you like!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn total you have the Square, Circle, Triangle, Pentagon and Hexagon. (only the Square you get, the others are included in the DLCs, but that's ok, they are only worth one euro! )<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat are you waiting for? I say start the game and relax your eyes a bit.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d50f096d7b8f0a61b0a735c2f81bb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["edybtt Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["edybtt Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
