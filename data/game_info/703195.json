What to do?\r\n<p>In the main game, press [ESC] to open the pause menu. Then uncheck \"Fullscreen\" to run the game in windowed mode, and reduce the size of the window. This makes the game run at a lower resolution, which should increase performance on lower-end GPUs.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to play the game in fullscreen mode anyway, you can reduce your desktop resolution by right clicking the desktop and selecting \"Display Settings\" (e.g. if you're on a 1080p screen, you can drop down the resolution to 720p and it should run much faster)</p>\r\nI beat the game and I want to replay it.
