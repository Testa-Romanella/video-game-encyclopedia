They're armed and they're invading. It's up to you to protect the homeland from defeat. <br/><br/>Puzzle Bloc Invasion is a genre shifting, classic arcade shooter built around powering up your shot, igniting color combos, and clearing out levels as quickly and efficiently as possible (for maximum reward).<br/><br/>This is an arcade game in the truest sense. It's about trying to best your high score and setting new time records. It does NOT include: story, multi-player, DLC, micro-transactions, skins, crates, cosmetics, etc. It simply hopes to capture that quick pick up and play, just one more game spirit.How To Play:<br/><br/><ul><li>Build your power-up by destroying blocks that match your ship's color.<br/></li><li>While powered up, shots unleash chains of destruction on all neighboring blocks of similar color.<br/></li><li>Matching shots also build your score multiplier.<br/></li><li>Mismatched shots reset your multiplier and power-up.<br/></li><li>Level bonuses for speed, accuracy, and skill.</li></ul>Key Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>Each level randomly generated.
