Manage to survive multiple levels of typing challenges. Compete against your friends to see which one of you is the ultimate typist. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>More than <em>70 000</em> different quotes, which you will have to type out. Try to beat all of them. <br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Good luck soldier! </strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for visiting my game's page! I appreciate all of you players around the world.</p>\n<p>This is my very first try at creating a game. I'm a CS student and this was my summer holiday project, mainly to learn Unity. I tried to recreate a game from my first year at high school which was made in Greenfoot. You can download that game too if you want (Download -&gt; wordpunk.gfar), but you will also need the Greenfoot IDE.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy the game and if you do, donations are always welcome! At least I can get a coffee &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/622603b4eb44fd6f141bc70d6a674364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shiftoss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
