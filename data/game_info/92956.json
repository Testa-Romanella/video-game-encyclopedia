I'm a scientist and I believe in human experimentation. Prisoners deserve to be experimented on, and be useful to society at least once. I work with two other scientists, Mike Hawk and Andrew Allen. I mostly work with Mike Hawk since I'm mostly stuck in his lab, but it's great to work with Andrew Allen more since he can make greater advancements than Mike and I both. Mike and I created a virus that makes prisoners go insane, but thanks to Mike laziness, he became infected too. Now I need to escape his lab and get to Andrew as soon as possible.</p><p>The music was created by Danny Baranowsky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a43c15e3b3b31e32a3f705ed51bc124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evilrakion"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
