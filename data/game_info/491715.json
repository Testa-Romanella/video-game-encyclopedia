Prologue", "description": "The full story:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/680830/Wait_Life_is_beautiful/<br/><br/>The process of playing <strong>Wait! Life is Beautiful!</strong> is similar to watching a film that stimulates a nerve, especially when the viewer finds themselves immersed in the protagonist's anxious state of mind. At the center of the plot is a young guy, an ordinary clerk, he is not at all a hero, and certainly not a magician. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Watching him, we are instilled with his emotions such as tiredness from the monotony of life and depressing thoughts about the meaninglessness of life. However, there is a desire to change his life for the better, to look for a new meaning - in empathy, compassion, while helping others.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As we try to engage in dialogue with potential suicide victims, we can study their problems and carefully choose the right words in an attempt to talk them down. This can be difficult because the main character tends to cover up his fear with black humor and an ironic attitude to what is happening. This is his defensive reaction. Against the background of stress from the stories he heard and his regrets about the departed, the main character begins to see dark psychedelic dreams that give rise to a feeling of approaching madness.<br/><br/>However, do not forget: all events and characters in the game are fictional. Moreover, the game does not aim at saving everyone. The only purpose is to make you think.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9ec2fd562af05d67b20a2c062ba72a0.jpg", "website": "https://wlibgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GameNet"], "esrb_rating": null}
