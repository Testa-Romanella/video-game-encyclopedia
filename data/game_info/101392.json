The cost is only a way of supporting the further development of the project.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you charge for this?</strong></p>\n<p>I would like to be able to do pervy games and toys for a living. For now, I can't do it full time because I need to have a more normal job. Also, because it's not free to make either.\u00a0I will make a free demo version in the coming days. Free demo is up.</p>\n<p>If you go to my Patreon, you can get the following builds for less that this price. You can also receive multiple in-progress builds as I work on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find more?</strong></p>\n<p>dorumeka.tumblr.com\u00a0is where I show what I'm doing and what I'm thinking.\u00a0patreon.com/dorumeka\u00a0is my Patreon.
