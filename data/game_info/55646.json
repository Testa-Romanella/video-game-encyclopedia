(1990)", "description": "<p>Spaceward Ho! is a turn-based science fiction computer strategy game that was written by Peter Commons, designed by Joe Williams (Joedelta) and published by Delta Tao Software. The first version was released in 1990, and further upgrades followed regularly; the current version, 5.0.5, was released on July 8, 2003. It has received wide recognition in the Macintosh community, for example being inducted into the Macworld Game Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>Spaceward Ho! can be categorized in the 4X game genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) with a theme of galactic conquest. It took many elements of its design from the earlier Reach for the Stars, but expanded on many of that game's basic themes while taking advantage of the larger memory and better graphics available on the Mac platform.</p>\n<p>Version 5 is available for Classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X versions before 10.7 (there is no universal binary) and Palm OS. Version 4 is also available for Windows and version 2 for Amiga.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7359657fee98df9a6d7bd0cb47b9d165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Delta Tao Software", "[http://www.ariton.com/ Ariton](iOS)", "[http://mobilefreon.com/ Mobilefreon]"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Delta Tao Software", "[http://www.ariton.com/ Ariton](iOS)", "[http://mobilefreon.com/ Mobilefreon]"], "esrb_rating": null}
