The exit is in a light pillar. This game can exercise your memory. You need to choose a road at a fork in the road. When you can't walk, you need to go back. This requires your memory and sense of direction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no BGM in the game, because I think every player plays maze in a different mood and needs different music to express, so I hope that players can play their favorite music in music software.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt present, there are not many game levels, mainly do not know how many people are interested in this type of game, if someone is interested in this game, it will always be updated.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63a0f7f0ed840fce9adb59e585fd80f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HuYu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HuYu"], "esrb_rating": null}
