It has a lot of issues, one being the terrible art ;P</p>\n<p>I'd love to get some feed back on this\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks and Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Link to Trijam Page:</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/trijam-24<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:39", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMTU5NjAucG5n/original/SwOtjv.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["CedarBishop"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
