After you click play and configured the grid, you press the \"Start\" button, which would run the simulation.<br/></p>\n<p>3. On the left panel, you will have several dropdowns which you have to choose correctly based on the number of the zone.</p>\n<p>4. The game has 4 zones:</p>\n<p>Zone 1: Deadly zone - a zone where after 10 generations every cell dies.</p>\n<p>Zone 2: Standard zone - Conway's rules.</p>\n<p>Zone 3:\u00a0Lucky zone: a zone where a\u00a0living cell with fewer than two living neighbors does not always die from underpopulation (same for overpopulation);</p>\n<p>Zone 4:\u00a0Friendly zone: a zone where living cells with fewer than two living neighbors\u00a0do not always die from underpopulation. Instead, they survive if there are other living cells nearby.</p>\n<p>5. Keep in mind that the above-mentioned zones are abstract. On the physical zones of the grid, they will be placed randomly each time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9aff9c20e9d0d732c39768a3fcb5c6d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frunzze"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
