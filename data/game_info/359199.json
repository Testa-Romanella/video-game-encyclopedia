{"id": 359199, "slug": "mojib-ribbon", "name": "Mojib-Ribbon", "name_original": "Mojib-Ribbon", "description": "<p>Mojib-Ribbon (\u30e2\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3, Mojiburibon) is a music video game created by Masaya Matsuura as a spin-off of his 1999 music game, Vib-Ribbon, which was released for PlayStation. A direct sequel called Vib-Ripple was released in 2004. The releases are comparable to the releases of the earlier PaRappa series (also a Matsuura series) where the original was followed by a pseudo-sequel and then a direct sequel a few years later.</p>\n<p>Whereas in Vib-Ribbon the gameplay centered on the player&#39;s interaction with the melody of the song being played, in Mojib-Ribbon the gameplay centers on the player&#39;s interaction with the lyrics. As such, the music employed in the game is heavily lyrics-oriented rap music. The game&#39;s art-style is centered on traditional sumi-e and Japanese kana calligraphy. This has led to claims that the game is incomprehensible to non-Japanese audiences, however the simplicity of gameplay have allowed numerous import gamers (typically also fans of Masaya Matsuura&#39;s works) to enjoy the game as well, and guides exist online regarding menu navigation instructions for non-Japanese speakers. </p>\n<p>Source: Wikipedia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T21:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da8de0a98aca25967e33fb498660f6fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["NanaOn-Sha", "NanaOn-Sha co."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
