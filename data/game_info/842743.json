The game has a fixed turn order, always changing between teams and with a turn consisting of a move and attack phase, both skippable.</p>\n<p>The relevance to the theme is that the prey are together protecting themselves against predators.</p>\n<p>Made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 (https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8)</p>\n<p><strong>The rotate camera buttons are (maybe?) not working.
