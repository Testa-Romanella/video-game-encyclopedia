With a helpful reference to reivew which numbers have been called already, you can be the life of the party as a Bingo master everywhere you go!</p>\n<p><em>This game will be best played on a\u00a0playdate, but since I don't have one yet, it is currently built to run in your browser.</em></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Press A to start a game with virtual players,\r\nor press B to just call and track numbers.</p>\n<p>Spin the mouse wheel to spin the bingo cage. (I\u00a0recommend scrolling up so your entire browser window doesn't scroll as well)</p>\n<p>Up/Down Arrow Keys will scroll the call history.</p>\n<p>Press B to go back to the main menu.</p>\r\nFuture of this game\r\n<p>I built this game while waiting for the playdate handheld console to open up for pre-order and release the SDK/dev tools. It's very much only a game in the loosest of terms. As for actual gameplay beyond purely a Bingo caller, I do want to add some interactions with the virtual players. I'm experimenting with what kind of interactions would be most fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T07:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4343d988694e3e8842caf8b471b277b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nathan Heffley"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
