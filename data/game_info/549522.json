Theme : Adventure, Limitation : Death as a core mecanic.</p><p>##### ##### ##### #####</p>\n<p>My first idea was to have a lot of traps and use them to finish the level. Since it would've been more a platformer, I continued my search. My second idea was to make the reaper a mecanic of cores but I didn't know where to go from there.</p>\n<p>The first prototype I went with, was with a game where the hero had the power to die and pass through walls as a ghost. He had to be quick because a healer was running after him to resurrect him back to life. After some tests, it wasn't as fun as I tought it would.</p>\n<p>Still on my to-do list :</p>\n<ul><li>Add more levels</li><li>Have Shad find ways to forfeit his life spark to summon Lily instead of by pressing a button</li><li>Allow Lily to pass through phantom-fences only in shadowed areas</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks :</p>\n<ul><li><em>Graveyard tileset by angrysnail</em></li><li><em>Sound effects by\u00a0Juhani Junkala</em></li><li><em>Background music - Village Ruins - by\u00a0isaiah658</em></li><li><em>Win music - Trop la win - by\u00a0loyaltyfreakmusic</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd2a2a8b1955582da6c11095937c93d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pierrol"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
