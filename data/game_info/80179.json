When you hit a target there\u2019s always some sort of reaction\u2026 Hitting a light is actually location sensitive, so the part of the lights you hit actually go out instead of the whole thing. My favorite effect of all, however, is the flaming bat when you\u2019re \u201con fire\u201d\u2026 From the crack of the bat against the ball to the clunk when the ball fell short and hit the wall, everything sounded right.  As a result, Batter Up Baseball scores a home run in my book.\u201d<br/>Technobrains.com<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Always thought you were major league material?
