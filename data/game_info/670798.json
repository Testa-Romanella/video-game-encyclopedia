This is the first episode in a four-episode series that will help build the lore of the game. All four of the episodes will be free releases.

If you do, however, thank you very much all proceeds will go to improving the main game and upcoming episodes of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One thing that came back from beta testers was that an error would pop up when they changed the sound and this was called an EPERM error. If this happens the solution is to change the location of the change on the hard drive as it has tried to write something onto the file and it can't. The error resolves itself when the program is moved to a readable directory or drive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any issues or questions please feel free to contact me through Twitter at @Kallisti777.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec89396f56c63af6f2302cc836443e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kallisti777"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
