Throughout the game, you can use up to seven unique hand gestures to communicate with people and fiddle with your environment. Careful though, try not to anger people too much \u2013 your life could depend on it!<br/>Helping Hand works with a keyboard and mouse. Each finger within the game relies on a separate input. By default, the controls are:<br/><br/>\u201c1\u201d for your pinky finger<br/>\u201c2\u201d for your ring finger<br/>\u201c3\u201d for your middle finger<br/>\u201c4\u201d for your index finger<br/>\u201cSpace Bar\u201d for your thumb<br/><br/>As you press each button, your finger will bend. If you bend your fingers in the right combination, you will form a gesture. Check out the instruction screen if you\u2019re stuck and feel free to change the finger inputs inside the game!<br/>Good luck! And try to be nice to Nurse Barbara\u2026<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/39631b135ebdb9b71f9ca213200c0aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hubblegum"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hubblegum"], "esrb_rating": null}
