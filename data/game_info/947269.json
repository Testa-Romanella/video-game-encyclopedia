He must embark on a long journey to defeat the Dark Lord- Sounds familiar, right? There's only one problem...</p>\n<p>Bill refuses.</p>\n<p>He has no desire to go on an adventure, but the gears of fate has already started turning. This RPG is a parody of a typical \"Chosen One\" story, with a heavy emphasis on humor. It's my first game ever made with RPG Maker, and I had originally intended for it to be much, much bigger. Despite that, I hope you give this game a try, enjoy it, and look out for more projects from me using this engine!\u00a0</p>\n<p>(PS: If you encounter any issues with the game, leave a comment and I'll make a patch!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T09:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f3fb00356b28bba38994e405fdf95a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BLSturton"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
