Build decks in your card collection and play with your own creations. You are only permitted a maximum of 2 of each card in your deck. Find out how you can make your deck even better with new cards.<br/>2. Each type of Gem (Fire, Water, Air, Earth and Spirit) has different advantages. Combine them with matching Turn Spells and Battle Spells for maximum points.<br/>3. Balance: The relationship between Beast Cards and Spell Cards is crucial to your strategy. Experiment and find the right balance for your strategy.<br/><br/><strong>STRATEGIES</strong><br/>1. BLOCKING: Block your opponents from forming combinations by using the blank edges on your Beast Cards. This prevents your opponents from making high-scoring Beast Card connections.<br/>2. MANA POOLS: Mana Pools can be unlocked when they are placed smartly. But be careful \u2013 your opponent can also unlock them!<br/>3. OPPONENT\u2019S HAND: Become a true Book of Beasts master by analysing and taking into account the opponent\u2019s cards in your own turn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T02:08:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a1c16d42cce9c4e6064a2e2045c8c9f.jpg", "website": "http://playbookofbeasts.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gbanga"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gbanga"], "esrb_rating": null}
