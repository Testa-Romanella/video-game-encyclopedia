You can only control one squadmate at a time, but you can activate <strong>alert mode</strong> to cover your flanks as you move from objective to objective. <strong>Alert mode </strong>will attempt to shoot any enemy that enters the cone drawn from the character.<br/></p>\n<p> Carefully advance to the objectives, marked by blue squares,\u00a0 to earn points. Make sure that you cover all your flanks, because enemies can come from anywhere on the border of the map.</p>\n<p><strong>Alert</strong> cones will work best if they are holding long angles. Watch out, because enemies can approach your characters from the side, rendering their <strong>alert</strong> useless. Pay attention and keep all of your squadmates alive, lest you get surrounded and outlflanked.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Quit game - Esc<br/>Select character - Number keys<br/>Move - WASD<br/>Aim alert cone- Hold RMB<br/>Activate alert mode - Stand still and release RMB<br/>Manually aim - Hold LMB<br/>Manually fire - Release LMB</p>\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<p>GAME WONT OPEN:</p>\n<p>If the game wont open then you need to install the newest JRE here.
