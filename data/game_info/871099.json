So I had to find a way to destroy asteroids without using a weapon.\u00a0You only have a speed boost\u00a0so <strong>you have to crash into asteroids to destroy them</strong>.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>I suggest you to use a Gamepad to play:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Analog to move</li><li>A to boost</li><li>B to slow time</li></ul>\n<p>If you only have keyboard at hand:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>\u00a0SPACE to boost</li><li>SHIFT to slow time</li></ul>\r\nPointless development goals\r\n<ul><li><strong>Adaptive camera movement</strong>: the camera follows the spaceship based on it's speed and direction.</li><li><strong>Trauma based screenshake</strong>: some events produce an amount of trauma that is added to the camera and produces a shake. Trauma depletes with time producing a natural effect.</li><li><strong>Slow motion:\u00a0</strong>useless but cool</li><li><strong>Use a finite state machine for player states</strong>: you always have to implement a FSM to manage player states</li><li><strong>Color palette shader</strong>: I created a color swap palette shader to limit the game to 6 colors. I could also change colors at runtime but I didn't use that feature in this game</li><li><strong>In game debug layers</strong>: see this tweet and this tweet\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music: Stars\u00a0by Decktonic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T13:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6ea07c5f05fba3f3b27fb5a88a642370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["annoiato"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
