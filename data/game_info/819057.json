{"id": 819057, "slug": "dice-guessing", "name": "Dice Guessing", "name_original": "Dice Guessing", "description": "<p>Dice Guessing is a game about two players rolling dice, and trying to guess who has the higher roll. You can only see how many dice your opponent rolled before making a guess. The computer will always choose +/- 1 die from whatever you rolled, to keep things interesting.</p>\n<p>So you're rolling dice literally, but also taking chances on limited information and odds. Each guess is a metaphorical roll of the dice.</p>\n<p>I had fun putting this game together, and hope you enjoy playing it for a few minutes. You could easily play this in-person with real dice with just a few tweaks to the rules. I think inventing games with common pieces like playing cards or standard dice is a fun exercise. Most of the game design comes down to making fun rules.</p>\n<p>How would you make the game more exciting? Maybe some betting rules? Perhaps a fixed pool of dice over a set number of rounds, so you have to strategize when to roll more or fewer dice? <br/></p>\n<p>Made in Godot 3. Credit to Kenney.nl for the dice sprites.
