Shields can be accumulated indefinitely, but health cannot exceed the maximum.  <br/>There are currently five levels, the first of which is a simple kill game that is completed by clearing all enemies.  For the rest of the level, the enemies will flow out of the big transport helicopter, which must be destroyed first, and then the rest of the enemies will be cleared.  Note that the enemy will come to the rescue when attacking the transport helicopter.  <br/>Fight when you're ready!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad7b557f03409895f73997518f4528a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Youth Game"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Youth Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
