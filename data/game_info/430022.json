I need someone to continue the investigation if the worst happens to me. The last months have been very tense in this monastery. Every few weeks, a monk is found in the morning shredded to pieces and splattered in blood. Even if the abbotts say they already sent a letter asking for help, it shouldn't take this long for help to come. It's clear they're hiding something from us. <br/></p>\n<p>So I've decided to take action. Whoever - no, whatever - is doing this must be inside the monastery. One night, I eavesdropped on the abbotts, and heard about some creature, called <strong>MAY'TAH</strong>. I headed to our library in order to find more about it, but came empty-handed. Weeks of research led to nothing at all. Now, there is only one place left to check - the <strong>RESTRICTED SECTION</strong> of the library. No one aside from the abbotts can go there, and whoever tries to enter and gets caught, is sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>I know I'm putting my life on the line. But I can't stand knowing I might be the next victim, and that the abbotts are doing nothing about it. So, on this night blessed by the full moon, I'm heading there. I'm going to search books about the <strong>MAY'TAH</strong> in the <strong>RESTRICTED SECTION</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><strong>Arrow Keys / WASD</strong>: Move / Select<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Z / Q / E / Enter / Return: </strong>Accept<strong> </strong>/ Interact</p>\n<p><em><strong>Heavily inspired by the Restricted Section scene in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</strong></em><br/><br/><em><strong>Made for the </strong></em><strong>Haunted PS1 Wretched Weekend Jam 1</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/55343c49c32747f47815cc5d651ab1ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caique Assis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
