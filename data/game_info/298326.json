This is my very first game, the first one I manage to finish! I hope you will enjoy this! This is a short JRPG that lasts around 15 hours because I work solo. I did everything myself, from graphics to music. I promise I'll make a sequel to Neko Ex Machina, with a vaster world, references and a deeper gameplay! I used RPG maker MV, because I am an artist before being a developer, so I took an easy shortcut to realize my dream. But hey, I customized everything! I hope you will enjoy my game! Cheers!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/0889105e2fca90c3988a904490bd3cf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frelon-K Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
