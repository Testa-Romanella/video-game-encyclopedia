It was inspired by the old Minecraft mini-game \"One in the chamber\" where you only have one shot, and recieve one ammo on kill. If you miss, you are screwed. So, I implemented that design idea into a top down setting, where the player is rooted in place. This makes the game only about aiming. There-fore, there are multiple \"Only One's\" with this game:</p>\n<p>-Only one bullet</p>\n<p>-Only one task</p>\n<p>-Only one enemy type</p>\n<p>-Only one chance</p>\n<p>Check out my Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLheCDe9nkBY55_gXGhYmnQ?view_as=subscriber<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd10459e0e1ace7d4b38e3e5d6804127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["WillC_Squared"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
