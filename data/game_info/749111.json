Chase them away by whacking them! Don't hit the bunnies though, they're your friend!</p>\n<p>This game is a Whack-A-Mole style game, with two control types. On PC, either play with the mouse and click to whack the foxes or use your Numpad to whack the burrow that's in the same spot as the numbers on the Numpad. If you play on mobile, tap the foxes with your fingers to whack them!\u00a0The game starts off slow and gets progressively faster as time goes on. Can you get the full combo??</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Design: Rose Wang</p>\n<p>Art: Rylie Parker</p>\n<p>Sound: Fernando Valadez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d8383cea6c4b38ac0c057ab120e4cf90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["WoodenBucket Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
