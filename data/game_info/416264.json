{"id": 416264, "slug": "its-a-steal", "name": "It's A Steal!", "name_original": "It's A Steal!", "description": "\"It's A Steal\" is a\u00a0game about you trying to buy 2 products together that you have an insurmountable desire seeing as they're such good bargains.\r\n<p>This is a game for the\u00a0<strong>Random Theme Generator\u00a0</strong>jam, where the theme was \"Steal Insurmountable Odds Together\". I broke down the theme to it's barest components and found out every single definition for each word before beginning.\u00a0 As such, here's my breakdown:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Steal: </strong>Bargain - you're trying to buy something in an auction</li><li><strong>Insurmountable:\u00a0</strong>You can't not get you're hands on these bargains</li><li><strong>Odds:\u00a0</strong>Bids go up randomly.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Together:\u00a0</strong>Two products at the same time</li></ul>\n<p>Anyways, yeah, give this a go. I'm sure you'll hate it and find it as boring as I do (I'm good at selling this, aren't I?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d22b8ecaf73fa96dc15177bec91b44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabid Colonialist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
