The game has over 18 different weapons to tailor to your playstyle. Will you be a ghost only killing when absolutely necessary? Or will you embrace your bloodlust and leave nothing but corpses in your wake.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to story mode there are two other game modes, Arcade Mode is where you are dropped into a level and have to complete a number of objectives before a time reaches zero and escape. Should the timer reach zero an insurmountable number of enemies will come to try and stop you. The second mode is Apocalypse mode which is set in an alternate universe and tells the story of how a bad job almost destroys the world. These modes will receive three free updates over the next year adding new weapons and levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/095fd4fe3143d4f529080a9f0677924d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Unit 02 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unit 02 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
