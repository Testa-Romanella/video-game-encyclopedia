Moving Truck", "description": "<p>Generic, terrible little driving game made for DJam 6, the theme of witch was <strong>tiny town</strong>.\r\nIf you're wondering how I managed to create an  abomination below even my usual standard, the answer is simple: I  restarted after ~13 hours. <br/></p>\n<strong>Premise / Excuses to make this fit into the theme somehow</strong>\n<p>You're the owner and sole employee of Mick's Moving Assistance, Mick M. . You transport boxes containing important personal belongings, furniture, and the like between your clients' former and future residences.</p>\n<p>Your latest client had the bright idea to move to a <strong>tiny town</strong> in the middle of nowhere, on the other side of the state. To make matters worse, they're not your only client that day, so you have to rush through the country roads, which due to their  rare usage have managed to accumulate quite a bit of obstacles. Every time you collide with one, you lose some boxes due to the doors on your van being not exactly functional.\u00a0However,\u00a0you're\u00a0in\u00a0too\u00a0much\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0rush\u00a0to\u00a0pick\u00a0them\u00a0back\u00a0up\u00a0--\u00a0so\u00a0you\u00a0should\u00a0just try\u00a0your\u00a0best\u00a0to\u00a0avoid losing\u00a0them\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>There's 1 short track in the game, the only replayability factor is the scoring system, and I didn't even have the time to implement a highscore index.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, also there's a shitty \u26c7 reference that has a 20% chance of appearing every playthrough. It's not worth replaying for, I'll tell ya that much.</p>Credits\r\n<p>All the sprites in the game were made using the Indecision palette.</p><p>The fonts used are m6x11 and nicomoji+.<br/></p>\r\nUpdate clarification\r\n<p>The original (linux) build has been updated in order to fix some audio issues.
