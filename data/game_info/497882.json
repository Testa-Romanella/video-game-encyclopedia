You can see where enemies will appear 10 seconds later and even shoot them before they appear in the present. However, future enemies are already your enemies and can shoot your ship, too!</p>\n<p>I hope you can beat the game! It's pretty difficult but also short. If you want to test your skills, try beating it without losing health or getting a high score.</p>\n<p>This was made for Mini Jam 63. The theme was \"Future\"\u00a0 and there was a limitation in place to only use a specific colour palette. It is also the first game I ever released.</p>\n<p>By the way, yes, this game is inspired by Touhou.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:30:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c10d7da1b5ad18d41741b690d3aaaf8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ravenglass"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
