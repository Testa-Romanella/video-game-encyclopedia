But there is a twist! The left and right sides of the screen show different rooms in the same dungeon. When displayed, these two rooms act as one larger room. Going through a door will only change the side of the room that the door is on. Navigate through the dungeon to get the correct rooms on the right and left side of the screen to open a\u00a0 portal and escape.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:31:41", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fortisrufus", "67sivad"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
