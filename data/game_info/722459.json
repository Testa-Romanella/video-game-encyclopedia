Fixes some bugs present there. https://kitty-saya.itch.io/photophobia. Contains no new additions.</p>\n<p>Original description:</p>\n<p>Explore the abandoned city of Kriladam as you hide from the  streetlights, as the city's electrical network itself is bent on killing  you. Search the abandoned houses for a way to the network's mainframe  as you slowly uncover the truth of the tragedy that struck the city  years ago, with people turning up missing or dead every single day.  Solve puzzles caused by the disrepair of the city and dodge the light as  you try to destroy the machine.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This short (20 min.) horror game was made as part of the 4th RPG  maker horror game jam hosted by Beregon. This is not only my first game  jam game, it's also my first RPG maker game inspired by the likesof The  Witch's House, Ib and Mad Father. II hope you enjoy it!\r\n    </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Game by Kitty_Saya\r\n    </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Music by Cryodawn\r\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4f75ddce3b350597d928adcbf7c03f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Kitty Saya"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
