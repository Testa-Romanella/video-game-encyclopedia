Made with RPG Maker Bakin.<br/><br/> A controller is recommended but you can play without one.\u00a0 Pressing F4 will minimize or maximize the window in and out of Fullscreen.<br/><br/>I will most likely not continue this game, as I have ideas for more that I'd like to get started on soon. And these super-power fantasy adventures really can just go on forever, so try appreciate this adventure for what it is.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/549082a85b2ee096dca7a4f74a51b278.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneCardPony"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
