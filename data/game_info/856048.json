You must use your abilities to put out all of the fires before the earth sets to flames! You however must time your ability to freeze and melt with the obstacles that are thrown your way, and to find a way to utilize your multiple forms, and put them to many uses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>This is my first ever project in Unity. I want to give special thanks to CurdleGames for helping and guiding me through the process of learning a new engine in a jam. I hope you enjoy this little jam game we made!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard / <strong>Controller</strong></p>\n<p>Z or C / <strong>X</strong>\u00a0- Interactable\u00a0(Paddles, Springs, etc.)</p>\n<p>X or Space / <strong>A</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p>Shift /\u00a0<strong>B</strong>\u00a0- Change Form</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys /\u00a0<strong>Left Stick</strong> - Move</p>\n<p>R /\u00a0<strong>Select</strong> - Reset Level</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>StraightUpGruntled - Programming, Design, Music<br/></p>\n<p>Mr_Afroduck - Shader Code</p>\n<p>CurdleGames - Unity Help<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Asset Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>3D Models, Sound Effects - CurdleGames</p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gloria+Hallelujah</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T18:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47fb3bd8d1cb1d2e789e95dc0213bce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["StraightUpGruntled"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
