(ScoreSpace Jam)</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Left mouse click and drag for jumping and sliding. (You have 3 jumps and slides before falling to a ground) Longer you drag upwards, stronger you jump. Draging downwards lets you slide.</p>\n<p>Right mouse click and drag for moving objects. Longer you drag, stronger you push them.</p>\n<p>Space for Start/Pause/Resume/Next Level</p>\n<p>Collide objects with eachother for score! If you manage to collide them without letting them thouching to a ground for a several times, they give more points.\u00a0But beware of the time. If you complete a level faster, your score gets multiplied, if you complete it slower, it gets divided.</p>\n<p>Might include some bugs but it shouldn't be too bad.\u00a0</p><p>Sorry for the clumsy movements and wierd control descriptions.</p>\n\n<p>Attributes:</p>\n<p>The human model and sounds are CC0 assets I found on OpenGameArt.
