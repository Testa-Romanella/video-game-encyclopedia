In number 1 you will wander through to a city and explore (that\u2019s not all)\u00a0If you find any bugs please let me know down below ;)</p>\n<p>I will be releasing versions for windows and Linux, maybe android. Sadly I can not yet make it for iOS on the program that I am using. It may be iOS in number 2, but I am also trying to get it to work online. Also it does say that this works for touch screen but that will only be able to be used online, and that does not yet exist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T08:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597b7019c4eb9aaf872aec215bf0c42b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Bob the robot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
