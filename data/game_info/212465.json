A good way to test this is to select a movement, then shoot, then a movement. Like;</p>\n<p>1. Move Forward</p>\n<p>2. Shoot</p>\n<p>3. Move Backward</p>\n<p>I didn't know how to package my game...it's\u00a0my first time doing this :(</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>AD - Move Selector</p>\n<p>Space - Select</p>\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrows - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Blue Button - Shoot</p>\n<p>Right Blue Button - Start</p>\n<p>Blank Red Button - Remove Move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/66066a2a95f948272721e779cab882ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diddy kong"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
