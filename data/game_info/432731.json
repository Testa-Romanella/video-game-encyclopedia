I lost my all game files after my hard disk crash and I wasn't using any cloud system so I hadn't saved to anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>You was be able to add your song and make something like ball that come from 8 ways  also sync with beat like in guitar hero. You could add ball  and other features manually then  it saves to xml. I meant there was a editor for edit map for your music. However in the apk there aren't these features :(<br/></p>\n\n<p>Probably\u00a0I was making this game in 2017 by using Unity3d. Now I just have a .apk not game files so I had to stop development</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:44:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218de7b95a5a21afa27eaa11b51621c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cenullum"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
