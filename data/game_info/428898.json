No two play-throughs will be the same, and every action you take \u2014 from accidentally killing cosmonauts in \u201cworkplace incidents\u201d to failing to correctly assemble spaceships \u2014 will have repercussions that you and the fleet will feel sooner or later.<br />\nBecome a citizen of the stars: In Kosmokrats you will earn medals to display in your awards cabinet, read the very accurate Official Party newspaper, entertain yourself between missions with your state-of-the-art \u042f-Box games console, adjust the game&#39;s difficulty level with the help of vodka, and more.<br />\nJoin the SPACE FORCE!
