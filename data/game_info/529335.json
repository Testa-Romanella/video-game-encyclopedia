(No points for these, just FUN and entertainment -- similar to Game Shows! HAHA)</li></ul>\n\n<p>The Goal of the game is to pass through at least 20 obstacle holes, after that its Freeplay -- if you wish. STAY SAFE and\u00a0HAVE FUN!</p>\n<p>Commands:</p>\n<p>Title Screen - Mouse to click buttons</p>\n<p>Pre - Game - A/D for navigation, Space bar to select ( Ready, Set, Go!)</p>\n<p>In - Game - W/S to go forward/backward, 1 2 3 4 5 to change positions</p>\n\n\n<p>In case of score not registering properly:\u00a0You may pass the obstacle multiple times but it will only register once.</p>\n<p>Tip:\u00a0When you've reach 10 points, the game will play tricks on you, and a disabled\u00a0button will appear to end the game, it will only be enabled when you reach 20 points.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support!
