The theme was \"Isolation\" with a special limitation of \"There are no living things\". Animated non-living things were allowed so naturally, I decided to use a zombie and try my hand at a classic, Paperboy. I learned a lot coding-wise for this project and integrated random generation for the street objects, obstacles and houses. I didn't get this one developed nearly as much as as I wanted to but it was a great learning experience and I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Zombie -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/zombie-30232<br/>Music + Sound Effects\u00a0-\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/ambient/horror-sound-atmospheres-and-fx-96731<br/>Materials -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/flat-textures-demo-141275<br/>Skybox -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-free-103633<br/>Street Pack -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-street-pack-67475<br/>Houses -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/building-kit-1-68179<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T05:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46c2feb04b187fe35cae594ec68359bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rompkins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
