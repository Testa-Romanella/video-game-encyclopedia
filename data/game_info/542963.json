{"id": 542963, "slug": "who-is-the-master", "name": "Who Is The Master?", "name_original": "Who Is The Master?", "description": "<p>Welcome and thank you for taking a look at <em>Who is the Master?</em></p>\r\nThe Game's Story\r\n<p><em>Who is the Master?</em>\u00a0is intended to be a direct sequel to the 1985 Movie, <em>The Last Dragon</em>, where you take the reins as the original movie's villain, Sho-Nuff. I had come up with a new story for this game in which Sho-Nuff returns to challenge Bruce Leroy, the movie's protagonist, once again after being incarcerated for some time. In this level, Sho-Nuff comes face-to-face with Leroy's Chi/Force/Dragon ghosts that are preventing the former Shogun of Harlem from accomplishing his goal.</p>\n<p>--</p>\r\nThe Development\r\n<p>This was made in Unity. I originally made this game in 2019 for my 2D-Game Prototyping Course and I had a lot of fun coming up with the concept and figuring things out in the engine. The class had us script using Playmaker and it was a huge help as it was the first time I had ever used Unity.<br/></p>\n<p>I created all of the sprites using Aseprite.<br/></p>\n<p>The music is comprised of\u00a0several tracks I do not have the license to currently (1/13/21), so they may be changed at some point. The point, though, was to get a feel for the time period as well as convey the mood of the game.</p>\n<p>--</p>\r\nThe Future(?)\r\n<p>Though I haven't touched it recently, playing it again has made me want to come back and add more levels as well as actually change the UI so that I can finally put in dialogue. I'm also looking into changing the menu screen to include volume and screen settings. Lastly, I'd want to improve the hit boxes and invincibility frames so that the player's health doesn't absolutely melt as soon as it encounters an enemy. Currently, the game plays much harder than I intended, which its own fun, but I wanted a journey rather than a panicked scramble for the end screen.</p>\n<p>--</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>There is currently no volume control, so you may want to turn your volume down prior to starting the game. This is your final warning.</p>\n<p>If you have any constructive feedback, please leave a comment. Thanks again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T04:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468aafb2fc9cc5da9b06a3504066f6a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dubsmcgee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
