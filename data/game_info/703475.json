It is a typical platformer shooter set in an abandoned mine. The player's task is to get as many points as possible during his escapade.</p>\n<p>The game was written in Python and Pygame. It is not a masterpiece, but I have learned a lot while working on it, which will make my future games much better.</p>\n<p>The game is not finished yet (and I don't know if it will ever be), however I still need to add music, sound and more weapons which I will do in the near future.</p><p>Edit: well, unconsciously\u00a0I made a game very similar to Spelunky. I even set the same controls. It was really a coincidence, I swear.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>arrow keys to move</li><li>Z\u00a0 to jump</li><li>X to shoot</li><li>C to use special attack</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Credits:<br/>idea, code: Tomasz Oszczypko</li></ul>\n<ul><li>graphics design: Piotr Szybiak</li><li>font: Zacchary Dempsey-Plante</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f99206356124143843cf89cbe6d0407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Badzianga"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
