I love it!\"<br/><br/>---<br/>LOTS OF FUN by Kym6erlee<br/>\"I just recently downloaded this game and after the first game, I was absolutely in love. It's challenging entertaining, and requires a degree of concentration but without too much stress. Very similar to Tetris but the tiles do not rotate so you need to place them as they appear and the set of three tiles will not be replaced until the three present are situated on the board. That's how you will either win or lose the game. I recommended it.\"<br/><br/>---<br/>WOODEN BLOCKS by Merina<br/>\"Ok, I hate the friend who introduced this fun and addicting game to me yesterday. I sat and played for 90 minutes straight, telling myself \"only one more game... \"I LOVE this game. Just when I think I've outsmarted the game it comes back and shows me who's boss. It's an easy, clever game, much the old Tetris, just not as fast. If you like fitting puzzle pieces together then this is your game.\"<br/><br/>---<br/>PUZZLE FUN by A oSmile for fun<br/>\"Brings me back so many years when first I played Tetris a fun game then a fun game now.
