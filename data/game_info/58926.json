This demo will NOT grant a copy of the final game (it will be deleted once the game moves into the paid alpha stage.\n<br/><br/>\nXenonauts-2 is a strategic planetary defense simulator that puts you in charge of a clandestine military force attempting to protect the planet from extraterrestrial invasion. \n<br/><br/>\nIt is a hugely complex strategy / tactics game that gives you total control of your organisation all the way from the command staff in your base down to the troops on the battlefield, updating and expanding the classic X-Com formula into something deeper and more distinctive!TACTICAL COMBAT: Xenonauts-2 delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible 3d battlefields. The combat is just as deep as it was in the first Xenonauts - but now you have a wider variety of missions to tackle, a larger selection of equipment to do it with, and more deadly enemies to face in battle!\n\nSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT:: You have been tasked with defending the planet against extraterrestial infiltration, trying to hold humanity together as the aliens try to spark a nuclear war that will end our species forever!

There is now more varied and exotic equipment for you to play with, and players now have the ability to further develop technology and equipment they have already researched - provided they can spare the scientists!\n\nPERSISTENT SOLDIERS: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-23T21:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51b996f17b74b01905a70e72401dafb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 95, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goldhawk Interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Goldhawk Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
