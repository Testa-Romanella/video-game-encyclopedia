Play as either the slippery, scaly Snake Army or the equally slippery yet furry Mongoose Force as you endeavor to turn the tide of this eternal conflict in your favor in a game that is half-MOBA, half-Battlefront, half-tower defense. Convince a friend to play with a second controller as the animal you less prefer! (Note: This game is not endorsed by psychiatrists as a method of conflict resolution.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:07:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a910db50e591c6ccaeaa9967280213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vandervas Generator"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
