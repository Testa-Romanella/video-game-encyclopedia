Most of if came out of just me experimenting with different stuff in UE4.</p><p>The basic controls are your usual FPS controls - WASD to move, space to jump, mouse to aim and fire. Standing over a pickup and pressing E will pick up or swap to that weapon/powerup and pressing Q will activate powerups. The red bar represents your health, blue bar represents powerup energy. In order to progress, you have to destroy the enemy spawner in the middle (enemies will keep respawning while it's active) and then kill all the enemies in the room. That will open the next door and you can move on.</p><p>On the intro screen, the resolution can be changed using these number keys (not numpad):</p><p>1 - 1920x1080 fullscreen</p><p>2 - 1366x768 fullscreen</p><p>3 - 1280x720 windowed<br/></p><p>4 - 1680x1050 fullscreen</p><p>Gameplay video:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16767d4862d85a6dae55dda6bf3c1f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["simkas"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
