Luckily, an Earth-like exoplanet within an achievable distance from the Solar system had been recently discovered. Pooling volunteers from around the globe, a first-of-a-kind interstellar spacecraft was built and sent to colonize the yet unexplored planet. The gargantuan ship was named Pilgrimage, embodying the hopes of all of the humanity. To everyone\u2019s dismay, shortly after a successful arrival, the Pilgrimage went on total radio silence. What caused it remains a mystery.<br/><br/><br/>13 years later, research starship Recovery has arrived on site to investigate the fate of the expedition. The player takes the role of the space scientist River Elea Catherine Jones. She is driven above all by a personal goal \u2013 to find her husband Ethan, who occupied a prominent position on the Pilgrimage\u2019s scientific crew. By putting the character up against events and phenomena which are beyond human grasp, the game aims to defy the conventional notions of personal accountability, choice and meaning of life. It is a story about our fragility as a species, about finding solace through surrender.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/4504e106a17d8d81db0373e96ff9b989_x2iRwMd.jpg", "website": "http://www.projectelea.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 33, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Kyodai"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soedesco"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
