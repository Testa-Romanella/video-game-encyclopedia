You likely aren't Bee, Bunni or McSmooth.</p>\n<p>While playing this game, keep in mind I only used assets from other people.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind the game is\u00a0unrefined, and I did not attempt to refine it.</p>\n<p>There will be notes in the game that aren't directed towards you; because originally, I\u00a0was just going to send the game to three people.</p>\n<p>Since that is no longer the case, I'm putting it out publicly. The game is open source: you can do whatever you like with it.</p>\n<p>Have a wonderful day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:00:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bbaaa5cfa648ed9a443b046e6990b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
