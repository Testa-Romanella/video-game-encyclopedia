Enter the category names, along with how much score should be for each difficulty level, into the software. After that show the game-board to your friends/classroom/etc. and let them choose categories and difficulties. If they answer correctly the corresponding piece is theirs and the software calculates their current score accordingly. If they lose, you can either make the space unavailable by using 'w' or leave it for the other team to answer. The team that has more points at the end, when the time or questions run out, wins.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun ;)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Risk! by TV Nova, inspired by Jeopardy! by NBC<br/>Assets by Kenney<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b463efdbcc680c3df4987705e6117b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["F_TEK"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
