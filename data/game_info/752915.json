There are some interactions that players can click on the <strong>Generation Settings, Explosion, Solar System buttons</strong> in the upper left corner. For the Generation Settings button, the user can change the appearance of the planet by changing various parameters. Also, when the user clicks the explode button, the planet is blasted into countless pieces by the shock wave. In addition to these <strong>visual effects</strong>, there are many effects created by shaders or shader graphs, such as stars, atmosphere, and water. What's more, if the player clicks on the third icon, the scene will enter the solar system, and the planets will rotate and orbit with the sun. Whether it's a planetary or solar system scene, the user can change the perspective with different <strong>camera controllers<strong>\uff08WASD/MouseWheel\uff09</strong></strong><strong>.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30fe06fad51bf43df58587491ef1754a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["claireyuke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
