Adults only, please.\r\n<p>A fox lives alone on a deserted island, believing themselves to be the planet's sole inhabitant. They have everything needed for survival, but little in terms of purpose, spending their days swimming in the ocean and reading whatever they can get their paws on online.</p>\n<p>But there is something else \u2013 another island, possibly within reach, but far ahead of what would be a comfortable swim. As years pass, it becomes an obsession that refuses to leave them alone. Should the fox brave the trip, what will they find?</p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p><strong>The Other Island</strong> is a kinetic novel that acts as a demo for <strong>The White Tigers</strong>, an upcoming visual novel project.
