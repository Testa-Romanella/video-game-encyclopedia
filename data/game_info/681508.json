It's the direct opposite of the zenith... and your destination.<br/><br/><h3>GAME DESCRIPTION: \ud83d\udd25</h3> Nadir - Prologue: Slay the Six is a free prologue to the dark deckbuilding roguelike adventure, with its artwork burning of infernal fire, and many extraordinary inspirations, the deepest of them coming straight from Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy.<br/>Control powerful, yet extremely blemished teams of characters, each representing one of the deadly sins. Fight using a plethora of unholy cards and try to escape the seemingly endless, multi-layered city.<h3>TWIST ON A TURN SYSTEM \ud83d\udd25</h3> The <strong>Threat Counter</strong> shows how powerful the enemy's attacks will become. There is no limit of played cards, but each of them adds points to the Threat Counter, so you'll have to manage your risk-taking.<h3>CHARACTER-BASED DECK BUILDING \ud83d\udd25</h3> Each character on your team contributes to your main deck; find synergies between each Sinner's cards and build a dream (or nightmare) team.<br/><h3>CONTROL YOUR SINS \ud83d\udd25</h3> Every Sin has its own group of Sinners, shells that will bring its will to Nadir. As the sinners\u2019 journey progresses, their power will grow, unlocking new abilities to fight even stronger threats. And if they shall fall, the abyss will produce more fools to try.<h3>CHOOSE YOUR OWN APPROACH \ud83d\udd25</h3> Do you prefer raw damage or a more cunning way of poison? There is a multitude of different card effects to choose from. But remember that the enemy will attack you back, so you better look for cards that will decrease the Threat Counter.<h3>CHALLENGING BOSSES \ud83d\udd25</h3> Each level of Nadir has its own Floor Guardian that you will have to defeat in order to go deeper into the city. But be careful, each of them has a unique ability!<h3>REACH THE BOTTOM OF NADIR \ud83d\udd25</h3> This goal seems simple, but considering the characteristics of Sins, <strong>will they be able to divide the power between them</strong>?<h3>A JOURNEY UNLIKE ANY OTHER \ud83d\udd25</h3> Watch your back on your way to the bottom of Nadir, taking time to admire its horrific look. It might feel familiar \u2013 from the wonders of the Divine Comedy, to desaturated aesthetics of Sin City, to the unforgettable design of Hellboy \u2013 yet not comfortable at all.<h3>MODDING SUPPORT \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f</h3> <strong>Devil\u2019s in the detail </strong>and that\u2019s why Nadir offers a built-in, extensive modding support for those who want to expand the world of Nadir and imprint their twisted fantasies onto every inch of the game.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-09T23:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea49afcd20e6a42b14c3d3e3447f558b.jpg", "website": "https://nadirthegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 111, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shockwork Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shockwork Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
