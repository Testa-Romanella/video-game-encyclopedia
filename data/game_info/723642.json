Play on your own, or challenge an opponent to see who truly rules the day!</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>Pyramids were built in Ancient Egypt and Nubia for almost a thousand years.\u00a0The Giza pyramids of the Old Kingdom were used as tombs for pharaohs.\u00a0The exact symbolism of the pyramid is unclear, but some researchers think that it symbolises the mythological island that emerged from the primordial waters in some of the creation myths. \u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Pyramids in Egypt were designed by master builders and architects, and built by crews of manual laborers in a system of taxation called corv\u00e9e labour.\u00a0Despite the common belief that the pyramids were built by slaves, this is untrue.\u00a0Managing the enormous labour pool, feeding and housing the labourers was a mammoth task that forced the creation and maintenance of a robust administration in Ancient Egypt.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>The Galleries of Africa: Egypt\u00a0at the ROM has many artifacts on display that directly inspired Pyramid Party. In particular, the life-sized statue of the goddess\u00a0Sekhmet, dating to the reign of Tutankhamun\u2019s grandfather, shows the lioness-headed goddess that was the powerful goddess of destruction. Additionally, there is a scale model of the Step Pyramid of Djoser, as well as tools that would have facilitated the construction of the pyramid and other structures.\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!</p>\n<p><em>Pyramid Party was created by Capy for ROM Game Jam 2013</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf122538bf5bfcfcbfa731b5ab521dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
