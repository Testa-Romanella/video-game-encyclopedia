The setting takes place 50 years after both East and West coasts of the United States were heavily nuked, leaving only the central states to be habitable.</p>\n<p>You play as Akatosh, an androgynous protagonist who was outcast by their fellow Ranger clan. They set off on a journey to find themselves to be useful and have allied themselves with a small colony known as the Silver Lions.</p>\n<p>On your journey you will face tough branching choices and enemies, both human and unholy radioactive creatures. Will you bring peace to a scarred land? Or conquer it through bloodshed? The choice is yours.</p>\n\n<strong>Developer Note:</strong>\n\n<p>This is a demo for a school assignment I have. This is made only using Unity and the program add-on known as Fungus. It is a vertical slice of something that I would love to iterate on in the future. All the art in this game you will see are from public libraries put through the oil paint Photoshop filter and a colour filter to suits the aesthetic.</p>\n<p>This game also features player stats that allow the player to die or block actions depending on what the total stats they have. Death isn't featured in this slice as I wanted the player to experience the story, but a Tech Demo scene was made and is functional with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ae/8ae31aa12b276dc7325a829614671d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
