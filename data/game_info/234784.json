And don\u2019t worry, the game isn\u2019t rigged; it\u2019s for everyone! We don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Republican, Democrat, Green Party, or Gary Johnson, we just want you to get excited about voting. <br/><br/>Once per day, you\u2019ll get the chance to answer 10 multiple choice questions about the midterms, current events and very important facts about democracy like in what 1980\u2019s vampire movie Kiefer Sutherland played POTUS. Get every question right and you\u2019ll win cash from the daily jackpot, split with the other winners (#winning)! Get every question wrong and you probably don\u2019t know anything about the United States, so we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here. <br/><br/>How it works: <br/>* Join the game every day when you get a push notification <br/>* Answer 10 funny trivia questions while the clock counts down! <br/>* Win real cash by answering all 10 questions right.<br/>* Winners split the daily jackpot of  $1K to $5K\u2014and sometimes more! <br/>* Got a question wrong? Embarrassing\u2014but you can keep playing to win if you have extra lives.<br/>* No lives left? Now you're in Dead Mode. You won't be able to win today's prize, but answer correctly to earn lives for the next game.<br/>* Get bonus lives by signing up for election reminders, inviting friends, and completing weekly challenges. If only a political comeback were that easy! <br/><br/>Why did Full Frontal make this game? To get people excited about the midterms, maybe even excited enough that they\u2019ll go out and vote! America's typical midterm election turnout SUCKS and we are 100% certain this game will solve everything. We want America to learn facts, register to vote, and get involved in the U.S. election process. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? Don\u2019t answer. We know it is.<br/><br/>All civic-minded people are required by law to play the game for a chance to win a cash prize. Non-civic-minded people are also encouraged to play. See you in the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bf31ae34dd1d7cd2fc4e3c575092d3f.jpg", "website": "http://www.SamanthaBee.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Turner Broadcasting System"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Turner Broadcasting System"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
