By contrast, YUMENIKKI -DREAM DIARY- is a collaborative show of the utmost respect for auteur Kikiyama\u2019s seminal release.<br/><br/>The RPG Maker team at Kadokawa has paired up with Active Gaming Media\u2019s development team of ardent YUME NIKKI fans to bring you this modern indie title in the form of YUMENIKKI -DREAM DIARY-. This diverging follow-up combines influences from the original game and other recent indie juggernauts to create something wholly unique.<br/><br/>YUMENIKKI -DREAM DIARY- was created under supervision and with the full cooperation from the original creator, Kikiyama themselves. We hope it will help to create a whole new wave of fans, as well as push the envelope in terms of what RPG Maker games can become.Featuring \"all-new old\" original character!Characters that have lay dormant in Kikiyama\u2019s imagination (and design documents) surface 16 years after YUME NIKKI\u2019s original release.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-07T12:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/1133e14487a13954bd602c1c1697d781.jpg", "website": "http://yume-nikki.com", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 89, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["ACTIVE GAMING MEDIA", "KADOKAWA"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM", "Active Gaming Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
