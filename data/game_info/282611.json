Why can't they do it themselves? Well, that wouldn't be any fun. But more importantly, it's because <em>you are lucky!</em></p>\n<p>In fact you have <em>all</em> the luck. Your Guardian friend can help you along the way, saving you from catastrophe. That's so long as your luck doesn't run out! Which it might if you don't have your wits about you. </p>\n<p>But don't panic, because <em>Jinxter</em> is a fun, comedy adventure in a fantasy world, where <em>all</em> you have to do is rescue your friend Xam, find all four magic charms, assemble the legendary bracelet of Turani, vanquish the evil witches and save the World - all before teatime.
