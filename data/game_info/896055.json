Meanwhile, striving to win her sister's heart and prove her theories wrong,\u00a0stupid but stubborn dog girl Pucchi is\u00a0digging a deep cave leading to the Earth core. A global disaster is imminent, and the fate of humankind is apparently sealed... or maybe not?</p>\n<p><strong>Towelket: One More Time</strong>\u00a0is a japanese series of free indie RPG games made on RPG Maker 2000 by Kanao, first released in 2008. It features cute graphics mixed with a strange, fantasy-ish atmosphere akin to Earthbound; although with occasional guro and dirty jokes, giving it a charming unevenness. Most of the main games involve aliens invading the world and attempting to harm humans, with the main party being tasked with saving the earth.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Correct game's release order is:</strong>\u00a03, 2, 1, 6, 4, Fury, 5\u00a0(the rest is untranslated yet).\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Important: this game wasn't made by us (Patchy Illusion Team)!
