{"id": 201379, "slug": "asteroid-fu", "name": "Asteroid Fu", "name_original": "Asteroid Fu", "description": "<p>The core of the game is: <strong>Aiming at moving targets.</strong> The idea is to build all the game mechanics <em>into </em>this system, instead of feeling like independent systems on the side. Rundown of the game mechanics:</p><p>- Killing enemy balls slows down time for a bit, helping your aim.</p><p>- The level resets after a fixed duration. Together with the time dilation, there is almost always a chance to survive against overwhelming numbers, allowing for epic \"last stand\" holdouts.</p><p>- The basic enemy spawns two enemies in perpendicular motion to the player, so they are not an immediate threat, but the player must keep an eye on them.<br/></p><p>- Upgrades are unlocked by killing the big ball, which requires you to aim correctly, and to foresee that you are not in immediate danger</p><p>- All the upgrades are intended to (1)\u00a0<em>modify the core mechanic,</em>\u00a0(2)\u00a0<em>amplify one another,</em> and/or (3) just make the game <em>feel</em> great.</p><ol><li><strong>Bigger bullets</strong>. Easier to hit enemies.</li><li><strong>Magnetic bullets</strong>. Bullet home in on enemies that are very close.</li><li><strong>Longer time dilation</strong>. Makes it easier to survive in tense situations (which is most of the time)</li><li><strong>Unstoppable reload</strong>. Reload time becomes unaffected by time dilation. Greatly synergizes with longer time dilation.</li><li><strong>Minelayers</strong>. Bullets spawn a mine after a certain time. Aiming can now be used to build defenses, but they don't have time to work when closely surrounded.</li><li><strong>Ping-pong</strong>. Bullets bounce off enemies at great speed. Feels\u00a0particularly awesome with magnetic bullets because of the extra speed. Synergizes with minelayers, since bullets are almost guaranteed to spawn a mine.</li></ol><p>The initial idea for the game was to just make a mix of\u00a0<strong>Asteroids</strong> and\u00a0<strong>Kung Fury: Street Rage</strong>, hence the name <strong>Asteroid Fu</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK Game Jam in July 2017.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe12e1ddf90071f3f285388018e4c574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["asgerf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
