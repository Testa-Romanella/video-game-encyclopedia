The theme was\u00a0<em>Stuck in a Loop</em>.</p><p>When playing the Web version notice that there is quite some loading time (a few seconds) with no indication on screen that the game is actually loading. Also, one may have to mouse-click on the game for the launch screen music to start.<br/></p><p>All the commands are explained in game. Most in game events can be skipped/made faster by pressing enter (dialogue boxes, end of levels, loop steps\u2026).</p><p>With the offline version, one can make her own levels (just change the content of the \"levels\" directory). The level description format should be self explanatory for somebody who played the game. The level parsing is not very robust however (try not to make levels that are very large).<br/></p><p>The code source is available at github here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9ff7c46e4412a86ab19c3d8af7610335.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["loig"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
