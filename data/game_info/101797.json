You control\r\nArkhei, a combat architect who specializes in building so-called \u201cinstant\r\ncastles\" for those who have too much money, and too many enemies.<br/>\r\nYou build these defences by summoning one of many types of turret blocks; arrow\r\nshooting ones, flame throwing ones, steam spouting ones, and supporting blocks\r\nthat can help create tunnels to bottleneck various enemies.<br/>\r\nOnce these are built, you can climb them with ease using Arkhei's\r\npatent-pending steam sword; it's great for climbing, not so much for attacking.<br/>\r\nGet ready for some tactical thinking, and dying a lot (if you're not tactically\r\nthinking).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES<br/>-Proof of concept!<br/>\r\n-Fast, action packed gameplay.<br/>-Mix of pixel and pre-rendered 3D art assets.<br/>-Currently features 1 level.<br/>\r\n-Build different turrets to defend against the monsters!<br/>\r\n-Jump around a lot!<br/>\r\n-Unique enemy types, with their own strengths and weaknesses.<br/>\r\n-Kill flapping birds!<br/>\r\n-Crush enemies with your summoned turrets!<br/>\r\n-Become OCD!<br/>\n<br/>Current Version: 0.3.2<br/>Current version release date: 04/09/2015<br/>\r\nFull version release date: To Be Announced/Never<br/>\r\nPlatform: Windows 7, 8<br/>\r\nPrice: $0.00 (FREE!)<br/><br/>BIOGRAPHY:<br/>Hey guys, my name is John Bu, I'm a first year Game Art student in New Zealand. CastleRise is a game concept that I wanted to materialize, and had the opportunity to do so as part of the course. Hope everyone finds something they like in this game. If this gets a lot of good feedback, and if I somehow get enough funds and time together (along with a team), this concept may be developed further into a proper release. For now this is the state the game will remain, as I will be working on other game projects in the time being.</p><p>Contact\r\ninfo:<br/>\r\nEmail: contact@johnbu.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d993fc5953478deb66b3e8b791cdca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameKiwi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
