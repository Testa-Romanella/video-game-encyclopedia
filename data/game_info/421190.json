What a lovely bunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Mission?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The same as every other office worker.\u00a0<em>Go home early.</em></p>\n<p>Featuring a secret room, secret music, secret endings, hell, a secret intro. So many secrets. So much content you will never ever find.<br/><br/>Look, push and bother\u00a0<em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>You will only come across\u00a0the phrase\u00a0\"I can't do that\" the once. The JOY!</p>\n<p>Important Special feature: The main menu features a pleasant honking sound! Just click \"Not that one\".</p>\n<p>Also features a tutorial for those that work in offices that have never played a computer game before.</p>\n<p><strong>Background information.</strong></p>\n<p>This whole thing started as a mini project to build my first ever adventure game room. Exciting. I was talking about it with my boss at work and asked him if he wanted to be in that room and a game popped out of it by mistake. Play-tested by the people within the game, a lighthearted tongue-in-cheek adventure game popped out of this silly idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Install Instructions: \u2013</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Download and Unzip with your favoured zip-based software. Yes. You must. Must I say.<br/></p>\n<p>Double Click\u00a0<strong>TheOffice.exe</strong>\u00a0to play.</p>\n<p>Need to mess with the settings? Open <strong>winsetup.exe</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any problems with audio? You might need to change \u201csound options\u201d under advanced. You want full screen, you can make it so, baby. So many options. If the intro video doesn\u2019t work, man. I can\u2019t help you there. It\u2019s pretty damn flaky, but rest assured you're\u00a0missing nuffin'. Dialogue too fast or slow? Check out in the options in game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please enjoy</strong>\u00a0and sorry about the ceiling song.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/add70e9939e6bbc219c1f6c45b868eb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["drmcscott"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
