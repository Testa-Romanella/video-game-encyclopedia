Your life seems so endless down here...is time even moving? You watch out the window of your castle. You look down on the hordes of undead and outcasts.</p>\n<p>\"What did any of them do to land here? What evil deeds were committed? That reminds me of my time on earth and why I landed here\" you think with a smile. Once you were a Warlord. You accomplished so much. You captured town after town, empire after empire. Everything for your people and your religion. You were very religious and always listened to your priests. \"IN THE NAME OF GOD...In The Name Of God...in the name of god\" their voices fade away.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes in the name of god. I did everything they told me and yet I ended up in hell. Not even as an ordinary undead. No. As the demon lord himself. The Devil. I shouldn't have listened to them. They betrayed me. The Priests. The humans. Everybody betrayed me.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly someone bumps into you. You turn around. It's a newcomer.</p>\n<p>\"Out of my way!\" He commands. Apparently unaware who stands before him.<br/></p>\n<p>You look at him. He returns the look without flinching. You can see the fire burning in his eyes. Fueled by anger and hatred.</p>\n<p>\"Why did you end up in hell?\" you ask.</p>\n<p>\"I was a general in a grand army. We conquered vast lands, towns, cities, and empires. But at last, I was backstabbed by my own Empire. I did everything for them. I want to-.\" he explains, but you stop him mid-sentence:</p>\n<p>\"Take revenge, restore your honor and glory. Oh I understand you. I want to take my revenge as well. Grand general, would you swear allegiance to my cause, and in exchange, i will make you the general you deserve to be?\", you ask him.</p>\n<p>He kneels down, he swears his allegiance to you, your cause, and your empire.</p>\n<p>\"Good, now General, look out the window. Take all of the undead and outcasts and train us an army. I will continue my studies in black magic to find a way out of hell, into the real world. I will call for you once the time is right!\"<br/></p>\n<p>\"Yes, your highness.\" he replies.</p>\n\n<p>How to Install:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Download the zip file</strong>\u00a0that's appropriate for your operating system.\r\n</li><li><strong>Double click the downloaded zip file</strong>.
