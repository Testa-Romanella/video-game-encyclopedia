Lots of people need lots of stuff, right?</p>\n<p>And Gorbo the Great is a wizard, right? (yes.)</p>\n<p>Why not take random forest trash that they can scrounge up and use MAGIC to transmute it into useful items?!</p>\n<p>And then why not sell those items to customers?!</p>\n<p>Why not, indeed.</p>\n<p>In Incredible\u00a0Third Dimensional Copying Contraption, you play as Gobby, who hangs out inside of a stump machine, taking requests and making them happen. There are over 20 different items to create, with tons of different characters to create them for!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>For each round, you'll get an item request. Dolls, candlesticks, even cats!\u00a0Then, use the items at your disposal - things like mushrooms, spoons, playing cards - and arrange them to match the item as precisely as you can. Once you're done - OR once 10 \"seconds\" are up (there is no actual time pressure, it's turn based!) - you can toss your creation out of the OUT hole and reap your earnings!\u00a0Or, you know, not. Depends on how well you do.</p>\n<p>The game goes for 10 rounds, with different target objects each round. Items are random, so you can replay the game to try creating new items!</p>\n<p>How much can you earn in tips for a job well-done??</p>\r\nHow we made it\r\n<p><em>Code and writing</em>\u00a0by bkelly\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Art, music, writing, and code</em>\u00a0by kristinamay\r\n</p>\n<p>Game was created in\u00a0<em>Love2D</em>\n</p>\n<p>Music was created in\u00a0<em>Medley</em>\n</p>\n<p>Art was created with\u00a0<em>Pixaki</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sound effects from\u00a0<em>FreeSound.org</em>\u00a0(credits where required in Github readme)</p>\r\nA couple of notes on releases\r\n<ol><li>We have a web version but it\u2019s crashing on an animation, so we\u2019re shipping Mac + Windows right now, and will hopefully have a web version (unchanged save for the bug fix) up within the next couple of days!\r\n</li><li>There are two releases below - a 1.0 and a 1.1. The 1.1 fix includes a small algorithm update for image matching to make it feel less punishing. If you want an \u201ceasier\u201d experience, play the post-jam version. For a harder experience, play the original jam version.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0ccced34ef5ed6ef200f7c7e054235d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kristina"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
