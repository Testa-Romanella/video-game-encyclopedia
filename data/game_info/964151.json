Proceeds form this purchase will support the development of the physical game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis set of dice is meant to \"build a client\" for hair color training practice. Salon hair color training often relies in stylists to role play potential client scenarios. This is often awkward and unproductive. Hair Dice\u2122 was invented to promote collaboration, sharing of ideas and fun amongst colleagues. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRoll all the dice to build a client. Roll 1-3 Service Dice. If one of your Service Dice is Vivid, include the Vivid Die and roll each of the remaining dice. Find out what they want and the physical factors affecting their hair. Then formulate either with yourself or with your friends. If their desired result isn't realistic, formulate an alternative. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no right answers. Only the best course of action as agreed upon by players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-31T02:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe20de3bc67e3a2cf8953c6a4e9ec1e.jpg", "website": "https://www.hairdice.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Holland Morgan"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Holland Morgan"], "esrb_rating": null}
