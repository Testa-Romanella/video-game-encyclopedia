This game was made without the use of any engines or frameworks. Instead, I wrote the game in C++ and OpenGL, and I used SDL2 for window creation and input handling. The game is supposed to take place in a nuclear reactor of sorts, but I ran out of time to add any graphics that resemble such a setting unfortunately.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A Nuclear Reactor has gone haywire!  You'll need to navigate your way to every unstable core in this turn-based puzzle game to prevent a meltdown from happening!
