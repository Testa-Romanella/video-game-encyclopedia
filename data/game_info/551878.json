This is the game but is no longer in the submision list of the jam</p>\n<p>This is my submission to the black thorn prod #3 game jam. The theme was \"less is more\". Color life is a 2D puzzle video game in which we have two characters. We control the blue character by moving him around the stage, however when we do this the pink character automatically moves to the opposite direction. The player must think and make both characters reach their respective goal in the least amount of moves possible to have a better score. \"Less is more\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/9859450179c2d27763b2cde63f5540aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loading Dev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
