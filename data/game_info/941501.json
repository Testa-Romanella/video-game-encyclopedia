He\u2019s twenty-one years old, in his third and final year of university, but his interest in his subject is waning and he doesn\u2019t have any friends to confide in. His days are dull and uninteresting, and he longs for something to break up the monotony of his unremarkable routine \u2013 at least, until his father dies.<br/><br/>Unsure of how to cope with this news, Yuel\u2019s mental health collapses. Not knowing who to turn to during such a tumultuous time, he eventually decides to ask his cool and competent older cousin, Tavi, for help.<br/><br/>Tavi is effortlessly cheerful where Yuel is awkwardly withdrawn; outgoing and confident where Yuel is shy and self-conscious; flippant and irreverent where Yuel is stern and serious.<br/><br/>Tavi takes it upon himself, after seeing the state of his younger cousin, to cheer Yuel up to the best of his abilities. Yuel, however, is unaccustomed to kindness, and his feelings for Tavi soon become startlingly sensuous.<br/><br/>Yuel\u2019s life is hard enough as it is, what with his turbulent childhood, his non-existent social life, and now his father\u2019s sudden death, but this pushes things to a tipping point. What in the world is he going to do now, after falling in love with his own older cousin?<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>90k of text (approx 4-6 hours of reading)<br/></li><li>A kinetic story with no choices or branches<br/></li><li>Detailed character and background artwork<br/></li><li>A custom OST<br/></li><li>A sweet, emotional BL story with some drama<br/></li><li>Yuel being extra adorable</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Please note:</strong> The characters in this story originally appear in my other visual novel, All Ashes and Illusions, but no knowledge of Ashes is required to understand this story: it takes place in a separate universe and is stand-alone.<br/><br/>This story also depicts a consensual romantic relationship between a pair of first cousins.
