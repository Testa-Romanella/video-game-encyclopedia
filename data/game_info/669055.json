Clients can come in, and they will pick the items they desire and bring them to the counter.</p>\n<p>Depending on what the bubble above the client says, they require different things, but you only need to <strong>click on the client</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>If you are away or don't click after one minute, the client will leave without buying anything. You must then put the items they left on the counter back on the shelves by <strong>clicking on the items</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Dimbo font by Jayvee Enaguas.<br/>Doorbell SFX by 775noise.<br/>Coffee machine SFX\u00a0 by Acekat13.<br/>Cash register SFX by kiddpark.<br/>Counter bell SFX by InspectorJ.<br/>Universal Sound FX by Imphenzia.<br/></p>\n<p>Green Tea (music) by Purrple Cat | https://purrplecat.com/<br/>Music promoted on https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6a2279212cef2c791625718eafa1aa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mon amiral"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
