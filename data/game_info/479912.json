The game as it stands is unfinished, and will likely never be finished, there are a number of game-breaking bugs, and lots of areas that are very unpolished, yet I still think there is fun to be had in it, especially with friends, and the music, I think, is pretty nice. <br/></p>\n<p>It was a solo gamedev project I started in sophomore year of undergrad. I was building it in Gamemaker Studio. I had worked on it on and off for three years. It was a pretty ambitious project that I'm pretty proud to have gotten it even in the state that it was. I'd say it was nearly half finished. As time went on, I was less and less motivated to work on it, even though it was something I enjoyed making and enjoyed playing with friends. I never really posted online about it even though it was something I wanted to publish eventually. I'm putting it here so that I can pacify that small part of me that still wanted it out there, somewhere, so that I can move on. May it act as a motivator to help me finish future projects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d022b27e07ac0f7588b78018194cfe1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dllott"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
