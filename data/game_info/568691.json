I mean, who wouldn't be confused when the ceiling vents are haunted, her classmates are recreating the French revolution in the school bathrooms, and the student council is run by a power-hungry chuunibyou of 4-foot-2? Seriously, who put that kid in charge!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Completely against her will, Runa goes on an admirable (and whacky) quest to save Valentine's Day in the name of love. Or something else. She's not very keen on the whole idea.</p>\n<p>The game takes about 40 minutes- 1 hour to complete.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc97 </strong>Way more words than I thought I would\u00a0write originally!</p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc97 </strong>Cute, original character art!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc97 </strong>RPG Battles (kind of)!<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc97 Grenade Launchers!</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc97 Isopods<strong>!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc97Funney!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2728 Nicole -- Character Sprites</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2728 Isabel -- UI, itch.io cover</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2728 kalechips -- Writing, Programming</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Please enjoy this heartfelt story. \u00a0And remember--\"No crying till the end.\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:05:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a9e03e8ca9ec6d5cdb7d9b114762e3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["kalechips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
