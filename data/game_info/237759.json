He likes to play with gems, jewels, diamonds, but especially with coloured tiles. He uses his sturdy legs to touch and break the tiles, then shakes his long tail to remove them. He tries to remove as much tiles as possible and he is smart enough to use special weapons to facilitate this task. Unfortunately, he needs to avoid to be overwhelmed by incoming tiles and this is not so easy...<br/><br/>Do you want to help the Poshi Toky?
