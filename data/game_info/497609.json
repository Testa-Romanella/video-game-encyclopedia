Made for the Great Harvest Game Jam.\u00a0Set in an unknown time period, the player wanders into a forgotten and secretive but cozy\u00a0bar. This bar is a hub for entry to great adventures, as missions can take you all over the realm.\u00a0</p><p>This game is a prototype for an idea. Currently, there is not much to show, other than the general art style and feel. The combat is still clunky, and there's a plethora of code to add! It is planned, and will not be abandoned. I pledge to keep this going.</p>\n<p>The Idea: The player would be able to do procedurally generated missions from the Mission Board at the bar and receive rewards throughout/during missions and upon completion. I intend to add an inventory system and equipment system so that the player can witness firsthand the fruits of their labor. I will also overhaul the animation system for smoother transitions and multidirectional animation.</p>\n<p>I have not been able to put in the time I wanted to into this over the period of the Game Jam due to a hard month, but I am eager to keep improving this baby.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and making it this far!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d0d07d8ed0e7cc3df225d28196fbf5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pootpootpoot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
