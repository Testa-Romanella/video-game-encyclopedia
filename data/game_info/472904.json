I went above-and-beyond with that shader project, which led me to get a waiver to take CS500, the Master's-level ray-tracing course, making me the first student in DIT history to get waived into a Master's course from freshmen year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:13:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb4342e559f7d9e72badb2b2f37172b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
