The theme we used was Canadian Masterchef.</p>\n<p>Team: Joe Shanahan, Oliver Thurston, Melina Sp\u00fctz, Louise Hunnisett</p>\n<p>Awards: Best Game, People's Choice, Most Complete Game</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is to collect the three ingredients you need to make each dish. Because this is \"FasterChef\", everyone is rushing, and once you start moving, you can't stop until you hit something.</p>\n<p>There is also a special \"bonus\" ingredient that you can choose to get, but in most cases, this will require taking a longer route. You can't make all the judges happy in one go, so each level will require several playthroughs to complete everything.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83ffc686f1a22364587eb4094436d33f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Horsehead Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
