{"id": 19530, "slug": "tesla-effect-a-tex-murphy-adventure", "name": "Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure", "name_original": "Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure", "description": "<p>Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is a detective game with a high amount of attention given to plot unraveling. It is the 6th game in the corresponding series: with the five titles preceding it and one succeeding in late 2018. <br />\nThe game very much resembles the tradition of point-and-click adventures. One of the core narrative features is a 3D realistic background and live captured videos instead of usual cutscenes. All of the games within a series feature the self-titled protagonist with a setting in 2050. Tesla Effect uncovers the story of a Chelsee Bando disappearance. The first part of the title cues the players into realizing the role of Nicola Tesla in the narrative.<br />\nIt is little to invent in the point-and-click genre, but the development of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is presumably cut into two parts: actual cutscene and backgrounds filming and composing it all into the game content. The game features 5 endings and branching paths within the characters&#39; arcs. The choices within those arcs influence the ending outcome.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2014-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:07:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e315a1a1fbdc0035e8a7f390eee52539.jpg", "website": "http://www.texmurphy.com/", "rating": 2.56, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 92, "owned": 1478, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 19}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 475, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 61, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Big Finish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atlus", "Atlus USA"], "esrb_rating": null}
