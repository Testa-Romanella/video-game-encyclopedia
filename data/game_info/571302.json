This game is quite simple and casual. The main idea is that a person who play this game try to save the cube from triangles which fall out from the sky.To control cube moving, person have to use \"right\" and \"left\".In new version of the game there is a game menu. I really want to show my game for other people and earn some money on it. This is 1 of my first games and I really want you to buy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99fc7b0e511f62406f087d42515e74ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
