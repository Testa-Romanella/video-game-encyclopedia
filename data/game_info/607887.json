It's about half an hour in run-time and is almost exclusively cutscenes (you get one [1] fight). I was just having a lot of fun mucking around with cutscenes and writings. I like the idea of this game a lot so I might come back later and make it ~not suck~ but other games on my mind take more priority. It is on my mind though in case anyone, like, falls in love with this conceptually or something.</p>\n<p>If this is like, floating around on public pages or someone else stumbles across this, hi! This is not my usual caliber of quality and I hope even if you try this game and enjoy it when I actually finish my first genuine Cherry brand game I really knock your socks off! This is just for fun and to see what I can manage to do under a strict time-restraint ^^</p>\n<p>Made with RPGMaker MZ, using the default RTP. Slime sprite was pulled and edited from VX Ace (I own that engine as well). All writing and development was handled by me, Cherry! ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384d33727002882ec9ab772959f508b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cherrylux"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
