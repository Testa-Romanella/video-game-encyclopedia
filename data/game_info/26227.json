Explore with Follie and help her recover her seeds to \n      transform the world from drab to fab! You'll encounter strange \n      inhabitants, some of whom will help Follie in her quest, and some who \n      will hinder, such as naughty garden gnomes. Flowerworks is a single \n      player adventure which combines blooming flowers, colorful fireworks, \n      exploration, and a whole lot of fun. The game will have the whole family \n      immersed in no time, but be warned\u2014becoming a Flowerworks Master is not \n      for the faint of heart! Flowerworks includes Adventure, FreePlay and \n      Tutorial game modes, with three difficulty settings in a 20 hour \n      adventure.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/412b09273cf5a54a357891899321a0c8.jpg", "website": "http://www.flowerworksgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii", "PC"], "developers": ["Nocturnal Entertainment Australia"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nocturnal Entertainment", "Nocturnal Entertainment Australia"], "esrb_rating": null}
