By second or third grade, some students have become visual learners. During the late elementary years some students, primarily females, become auditory learners. Yet, many adults, especially males, maintain kinesthetic and tactual strengths throughout their lives.\" (Teaching Secondary Students Through Their Individual Learning Styles, Rita Stafford and Kenneth J.
