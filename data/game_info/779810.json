{"id": 779810, "slug": "the-price-of-flesh", "name": "The Price Of Flesh", "name_original": "The Price Of Flesh", "description": "<p>This game is not for minors, or for anyone sensitive to psychological horror/triggering content.<br />\nThis game is not aimed at typical straight males. I don&#39;t know how much more clear I can be about this LMAO! This sexual content in this game is built for Women, Members of LGBTQ+, Masochists/Submissives, and experimental people with open minds that also love horror.Welcome to The Price Of Flesh!<br />\nThis game is a hybrid between Survival Horror and NSFW. While the adult content is optional (it can be toggled when starting a new game file), the vibe of the overall game is still somewhat sexual, and the horror content is very intense- hence the minimum age.<br />\nYou begin the game in an auction, and you are what&#39;s being sold. You can choose one of three paths, being sold to one of three bidders.<br />\nMason: If you are bought by Mason, you&#39;ll be taken off the grid, deep into the dark Canadian wilderness. Mason&#39;s goal is a good hunt, and you are his prize. On this path you&#39;ll not only be dealing with Mason, but the mountain itself, and all the danger upon it. You&#39;ll need survival skills, and to keep your wits about you. You&#39;ll need to manage your health, the freezing temperature, and the onset of insanity to have a chance of surviving.<br />\nCelia: If Celia buys you, you&#39;ll be taken to the basement floors of an abandoned office building. Celia is a bit high strung, and she&#39;s looking for a way to relax. Unfortunately, her preferred methods of unwinding are a bit violent. One wrong move and you may lose your life. Her path is more psychological, and you&#39;ll need to be smart and stealthy to stay alive. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to tell time underground- and you&#39;ll never know when she&#39;s going to come back.<br />\nDerek: Derek belongs to a sort of &#39;club&#39;. If he&#39;s the one to purchase you, then you&#39;ll find out what this club is all about. In the middle of the desert, five killers bring five victims- including you. Not only will you have five murderers to contend with, but you&#39;ll have to worry about the searing heat of the desert. There&#39;s no food and no water, and the clock is ticking for your own survival- and that of the other four victims. You may need to work together if you want to make it out alive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T16:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b6a5ee234b721e6c01539118bfbf4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 23, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gatobob"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Gatobob"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
