We have managed to add two simple levels. There is no win condition at the moment. Please be kind as we are very new to game development and this is the first project we have undertaken. Due to complexity in the engine we got stuck on some mechanics and ran out of time to build more levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys: Move Larry.</li><li>SPACE: Enter/Exit Delete Mode.<br/>\n</li><li>Mouse Move/Click: Create Wire (Delete wire by moving mouse over it while in delete mode).</li><li>Right Click and Drag: Move Camera.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the controls to create wires that allow electricity to flow from fusebox to the TV in each stage.\u00a0</li><li>Powering on the TV in each 'level' will open the door to the next level.<br/>\n</li><li>Wires that have current/power flowing through them are WHITE. Wires that are unpowered are RED.</li><li>Wires that collide with the fusebox become powered.

We plan to increase this as we add more complex levels in the future. To proceed through the levels you can use delete mode to go back and add new levels.</li><li>You can only create wires from your current position to a position that you click.</li><li>Many of the art in the game are just background components and have no functionality. We plan to add functionality to these\u00a0in the future.\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>We have not had much time to play-test this game. As such bugs may arise.

The theme for the Game Jam was \"Joined Together\".</p>\n<p>We developed the concept of a 2D Puzzler/Platformer where you play as an electrician who has to wire up electrical household items to the fusebox to make the residents of the house/apartment happy. Larry is a grumpy electrician who just wants to get the job done so he can get to the roof of the building and eat his lunch (this is the win condition that we have not yet added). His boss is stingy/tight and wants the job done with the minimum amount of wire possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPERS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In the games current state, it is very simplistic. Please note that we are a small team of three people with little-to-no game development or design experience prior to participating in this Game Jam. 98% of the code and items were designed and written from scratch over the 48 hour course of the Game Jam. While the game is far from finished, we are very proud of what we have accomplished and look forward to expanding the concept further in the future. We would love for people to play this game and provide feedback on how we can improve it in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>LICENCES:</strong></p>\n<p>98% of the content for this game was designed and written by ourselves. The background assets that exist outside of the stage itself were taken from OpenGameArt.org and had Creative Commons Licences. We do not plan to make money from this game in its current state, and will ensure any and all assets used in the future are design by ourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66afba0cff5d5388074ae25c728220b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Data Boys"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
