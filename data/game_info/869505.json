Allow me to introduce Astrovoid. (I figured that since the objects that fall are diamonds now, it should have a different name...)</p>\n<p>I've added a couple of items in this updated version \u2014 a start screen welcomes you with some instructions, a field of stars zooms past now for ~ambience~, some fun little particle effects thrown in for good measure,\u00a0and now there's a little power up you can collect for five whole seconds of indestructibility. You're invincible, you're beautiful, you're Linda Evangelista!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I might tinker with this project a little more before my brain says I'm finished with it, but for now I'm proud of the progress. More to come on other game projects soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T15:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/6899f09fbd9a30e610d9432769ad62e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zach!"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
