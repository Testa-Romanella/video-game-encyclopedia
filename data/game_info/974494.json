It uses a 6 button layout with 3 buttons used as shortcuts for special attacks. Most would be on board with the concept until they discover a common theme in the gameplay itself: Most characters on the roster battle each other with Onara (Flatulence), though if you happen to know of the game&#39;s existence in the first place then that likely doesn&#39;t bother you. As well as original characters, there are guest characters present on the roster from various other related fetish media.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T15:53:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32d44f8b2c873b2f6ecfcab4c7101496.jpg", "website": "https://www.myabandonware.com/game/eight-marbles-2x-gyv", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
