I was cleaning up the attic at my grandfather's, who worked at Nintendo and Konami back in the day and found this Game Boy Cart with a smudged / scratched-up sticker, as such, I cant clearly see its title.\r\nI never got to play the Game Boy since I grew up in a poor family and always wondered how the game back then felt with pixelated graphics and crappy controls.\r\nWhen I got back I tried it on a retro console my brother used to have but to no luck, it didn't work.\r\nSo now I've ripped the contents and found that the game was a tech demo for an unreleased Castlevania game! It got no music but has sfx, there were a lot of bugs and glitches,\u00a0and only contains 1 level, but you can control 3 characters!!! This is like Castlevania III but on the Go!\r\nI made a fan box art on what it could've looked like if it was released. I do not own any of the licenses here but game preservation is important so please enjoy!<br/>\"\r\n<p>Now wasn't that fun to imagine? XD The \"tech demo\" was made with GB Studio by Chris Maltby\u00a0and all art assets are made from scratch by yours truly.</p>\n<p>The box art image\u00a0Michael Capay\u00a0[Edited by yours truly XD]</p>\n<p>SFX\u00a0 by\u00a0\u00a0Coffee Bat</p>\n<p>Give me a follow if you liked this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Tumblr\r\n</li><li>Mastodon\r\n</li><li>Newgrounds\r\n</li><li>Twitter</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T06:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e026e520e70f35949eb925173916e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elvies"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
