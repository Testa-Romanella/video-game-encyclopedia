To profit from this opportunity, Robo Corp, a powerful and monopolistic manufacturer of farming and mining robots in Australia, invents the &amp;#39;Chromatic Resonator&amp;#39;. Robots equipped with chromatic resonators are sent to the planet surface to induce a chromatic field that triggers an explosion that decimates the hazardous crystals (unfortunately, the robots as well).<br/><br/>You are the commander of this Robo Corp funded colonization mission. Can you clear the planets of crystals and prepare them for resource excavation?<br/><br/>Robo Corp introduces a new gameplay that combines the &amp;#39;match-3&amp;#39; mechanic with puzzle solving. Robots are dispatched from 4 sides of a crystal field to induce chromatic resonance. When three or more same-color robots or crystals form a cluster, an explosion is triggered. As you progress, you encounter new challenges, such as crystals with hidden chromatic characteristics, heavy crystals, and rocky terrain. Finally, there are the challenging mining missions: You&amp;#39;ve to command the robots to push air-dropped mining rigs around the obstacle-laden surface to position them on resource markers.<br/><br/>Features of the game:<br/><br/>- Simple match-3 mechanic that&amp;#39;s easy to learn, but used in a whole new, creative way in solving devilishly clever puzzles.<br/>- 60 free puzzles that are incredibly fun.
