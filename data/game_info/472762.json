For centuries, the fae were sighted on the fringes of human society, believed to be peaceful, until the rumors began.</p>\n<p>Some human children would mature differently than others, quieter, stranger. It was said the fae whisked them away from their cribs as infants in the dead of night, and replace them with shades made from fae magic, never to be seen again.<br/>Thus grew a rift, as humans blamed the fae for stealing their young for their own evil ends, for this curse of Changelings. But what if that wasn\u2019t the whole truth?</p>\n\n<p>------------------ MyFirstGameJam Summer 2020\u00a0------------------</p>\n<p>This is a game jam project, in which we had 2 weeks to build a game for our very first time ever building a \"complete\" game.\u00a0The theme is \"<strong>Change</strong>\"</p>\n<p>For everyone on this project, this was truly our first Game Jam. None of us having ever built a game before. One of us dabbling with game development over the years but never serious. We want to think the community for this fun opportunity we had. We had many more things we wanted to do but the goal was to make a complete game which we feel we did. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<ul><li>Programmer: <strong>Mastro2k </strong>- <em>\"Felt like I learned so much to take forward to future games.
