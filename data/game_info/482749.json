I didn't realize what nonconsecutive meant in regards to the time limit. However, I think i'm done working on this game.\u00a0 It was fun, but also very stressful.</p><p>OverFlood is a fast-passed 2D platformer, where you kill enemies and parkour while out running a burning sea of lava! It was made in 48h for Miziziziz Game Jam 1, where everyone Jams off the same art kit. The game was finalized and built before the 48h mark(3:30pm on Aug 15 to 3:30pm on Aug 17. If you are not allowed to make the game page after the time period, I am sorry.) It's not my best jam game due to feature creep and poor time management. However, I still had some fun, and made a finished, if slightly unpolished, game.\u00a0\u00a0There is no proper tutorial, as I had no time to create one, so, i'm sorry if the game is confusing a first. I am planning to make a devlog on the game, and I will post the youtube link once, or if, it is made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecfe51a59c0f2c3165de575dcfdc4508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RanchOnBread"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
