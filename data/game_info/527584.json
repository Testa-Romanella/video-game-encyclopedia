There was a shared codebase, as well as several shared textures created by Anna Zelisko, The goal of this experiment was to help keep the game fresh to us and to have a fun reveal at the end where we all got to play each other's levels. It was also interesting to see the different design decisions the three of us made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90011921c6db9b9121502f206c3baef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnLee Cooper", "Bear Vegas", "AGsilverAG", "Austin Heller"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
