It is still very much a work in progress but the idea of the project was to learn something or end up with something valuable and I did as I have a decent amount of knowledge of SDL2 and C now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't full screen the game as that does not work in the browser nor has it been implemented in the executable. The source code for this can be downloaded from this page as well and will go on GitHub in a while.</p>\n<p>I did end up using old art which I made for another game but other than that almost everything I did was made from scratch using C and SDL2. The game would have been much better if it was not for me having to restart and switch from C++ (another programming language) to C because C++ was toooo complicated.</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>\u00a0Right Arrow Key -&gt; Move Right</li><li>\u00a0Left Arrow Key -&gt; Move Left</li><li>\u00a0Space bar -&gt; Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T05:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c7bc229452a515157ef31eb05d09bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DevHedronYT"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
