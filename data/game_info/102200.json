Choices made in the second room can lead to three possible endings now (the last one of which isn't done yet). Added a fair few items &amp; one ridiculous sound effect. Deliberately haven't added screenshots of new stuff  because the discovery is at least part of the fun... Both versions updated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll work on the final room now when I've got time (though the art bits probably take more work than anything else &amp; I'm not great at them so it will be a little while), but there are a couple of fun, silly extra ideas I want to add so I may do them first. <br/></p>\n<p>- - - - -<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mac version updated </strong>4.4.18<strong>: </strong>same as the current Windows version now. I was honestly surprised at the mac/pc balance of downloads as it's actually been slightly mac skewed so I wanted to make sure an up-to-date version was up. <br/></p>\n<p>- - - - -<br/></p>\n<p>27.1.18: lots of things much improved -&gt; one ending is completely finished now . Quite a lot of new event emails posible. Lots of event-lines now in. Money system is basically working. Other probably-not-obvious improvements like making the save system better too. I'm gradually getting more competent as the project goes on so the new stuff tends to be better than the oldest stuff. <br/></p>\n<p>- - - - - <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Previous version </strong>notes: much swankier menu, a whole new room, loads more possible props, an email system so you can get requests for certain sorts of video, better/crisper drawing for certain parts and lots of other assorted nonsense. Very suitable for people who don't like cyclists. It's about 2/3rds the length of what I imagined it being originally now, though I'll probably have a tinker with a few things and add a couple of ideas to this form of it before I start on the final section. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/838afba3132061fddf7722bd45b107ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["pandateam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
