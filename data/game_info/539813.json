Roblox, Garry's\u00a0Mod, and Minecraft all use out-dated and difficult to mod engines.\u00a0<strong>Perpetual Sandbox</strong> fixes that issue by relying\u00a0on Unity for its engine.</p>\n<p>Put simply;\u00a0<strong>Perpetual Sandbox</strong> is a sandbox game meant for loading maps, and other\u00a0games. These maps, and games are called mods.</p>\r\nNote: The game is still early in development, though! There will be a lot of bugs.\r\nHow do I load a mod?\r\n\n<p>Simply download a mod built for\u00a0<strong>Perpetual Sandbox</strong>, then place it in the game's mods folder.\u00a0 Feel free to drag as many mods into the folder as you want. All mods in this folder will load as soon as you start\u00a0singleplayer!</p>\n<p>Without any community mods the game is very bland, it'll only load the player.\u00a0 Checkout the community\u00a0Discord server\u00a0for the main source of mods.</p>\r\nMost mod creators do not keep other creator's mods in mind. Be careful when mixing mods!\r\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/9876b25f9a0ecf24887207bcf9587202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Molasses"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
