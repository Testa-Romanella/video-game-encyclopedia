It is the Ao Oni experience everyone knows and loves, having been\u00a0rebuilt from the ground up in RPG Maker VX Ace to expand\u00a0upon the original games ideas while giving it a fresh coat of paint. New story elements and areas,\u00a0graphics, music, sound,\u00a0puzzles, expanded character backgrounds as well as multiple endings exist in Ao Oni R while still keeping the principles of the original, such as a low amount of dialogue when possible and the possibility of a fast play through.</p>\n\r\nHide or die!\r\n<p>You are never alone!\u00a0The Oni always has a chance of appearing!\u00a0\u00a0Hide from the immortal demon in lockers, toilet stalls and jail cells, or banish it temporarily using the new item, agrimony.</p>\n\r\nSolve the mystery!\r\n<p>All puzzles from the classic game return, as well as several new ones! New areas, along with 6 different endings and the ability for any character to die makes for multiple runs!</p>\n\r\nAn expansive cast!\r\n<p>All the cast have been rewritten to include a wide variety of backgrounds and emotions, each with their own agenda and goals that can be revealed during the game. Anna and Shun also make their video game appearance.<br/></p>\r\n-------------------------------\r\n<p>As much as I tried, I have probably failed to squash all the bugs. If you spot any, let me know in the comments.
