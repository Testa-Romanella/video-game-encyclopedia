There are some things, however, that can still benefit from a little bit of helpful automation.<br/><br/>That's where Initrax comes in. This tool lets you track very basic information about your characters--both players and non-player characters--and set the turn order for combat when it is time to roll initiative. That's really it; the goal is to stay out of the way and let you run your game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T03:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f3621babef5274a1b207588e65947d_q3UIZes.jpg", "website": "https://initrax.night.coffee", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Timothy Gourley"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Timothy Gourley"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
