Steal documents, sabotage colleagues, and wreak havoc!- but beware... everyone is watching</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game was created for the\u00a0Historically Accurate Game Jam 3</strong></p>Controls:<p>- Movement: 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'</p><p>- Sprint (hold): 'shift'</p><p>- Hint: 'H'</p>\r\nTutorial:\r\n<p><strong>Essential tip: Press 'H' to see a hint!\u00a0</strong>To lower your suspicion level, go to your cubicle until someone notices you there!</p>\n<p>1) Read the overall objective from the secretly delivered manilla envelope.</p>\n<p>2) Press 'H' to see a hint of your first task.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) Hold 'shift' to sprint.\u00a0Navigate the map without causing too much suspicion.</p>\n<p>4) Complete your objective by any means!</p>\r\nDevelopment:\r\n<p>We went into this knowing that we wanted to make something a bit bigger than our earlier games. It was\u00a0fortunate that we had a\u00a0friend (who is an experienced developer) want to join us! So, we added a new member to our team (bringing our grand\u00a0 total to 3).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps biting off a bit more than we could chew in the jam's period (1 week), we settled on a 1960's office stealth game. Also, we knew we wanted the player to be able to accomplish the main objective through multiple paths (similar to the Untitled Goose Game). So, the goal was to create a single, super map that was a sandbox for the player to accomplish whatever main objective they have through any means possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It turns out that designing and implementing such a complex system takes a lot of time :D... However, we managed to pull through and are proud of the we have to show for the jam! We've got big plans for new objectives, more map interactables, and even dynamic NPC dialog! Please let us know if you find any\u00a0bugs,\u00a0have a suggestion, or just want to say hello :).\u00a0Thanks for playing!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All resources and assets were made by our team unless stated otherwise</p>\n<p>- Code: Kyle &amp; Jasper (@Quazillionare)</p>\n<p>- Misson Design: Jasper</p>\n<p>- Art, Music &amp; SFX: Zach</p>\r\nBugs:\r\n<p><strong>- let us know!</strong></p>\r\nFeature Requests:\r\n<p>- More levels!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a6307bf594197816ca54d3e1c0467b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Studio Haiku", "Quazillionaire"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
