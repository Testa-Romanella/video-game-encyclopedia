Zombies", "description": "<p>Play as Santa and deliver presents, each present you deliver will turn a citizen into a zombie. Each zombie has its own skill that'll make the play arena more dangerous and harder to navigate. When no citizen is left without a present you'll win, but be careful, later stages zombies are more powerful. <br/>You can chose between 6 different skills to make your mission easier.<br/>This game was solo developed but it uses some assets from the asset store and from sketchfab, every artist has been credited in the credits menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T07:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184a609325e1e96a3784121aab77891a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lastra"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
