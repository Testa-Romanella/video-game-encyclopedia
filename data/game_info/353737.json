These bodiless entities are made from stardust, the same things we are originally made from. This universe exists in an alternate dimension. There are no living creatures here but stars, rain, gems and the beautiful galaxies.<br/><br/>Attribution: Music is Ambient Electronic 001 by Frankum and shooting star icon by Justin Church on TheNounProject.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T10:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f70c0c8c46922d36c56c07564a1e5a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kai Long Alan Du"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kai Long Alan Du"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
