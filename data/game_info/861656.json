All enemies will be continuously pulled towards the center, and if the player releases it while both they and at least one enemy are within the event horizon, they will teleport to the other side of the event horizon and damage all enemies within.</p>\n<p>If just the player is present within at the instance of release, or if it is quickly tapped (~0.1s) then the player is flung towards the center of the black hole.
