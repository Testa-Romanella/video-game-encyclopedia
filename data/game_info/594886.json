This technology could be vital in the fight against the corporate controlled Coalition, as such the MU has sent one of its most dedicated agents to explore the facility: you! You are tasked with finding this pocket dimension technology and discovering how it works, and hopefully surviving long enough to relay the information back to the MU. How far down the layers of dimensions go is unknown, but you have been told to venture deeper and deeper until you find the key to the research the MU is looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Project Pandora is my 2nd sci-fi puzzle platformer created for my 2nd ever Ludum Dare for the theme \"Deeper and Deeper\"! It was an absolute blast and I can't wait to join more for years to come. Hope you have fun playing!</p>\n\n<p>Art and Programming - Fonics</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects - Chipper -\u00a0https://chipper1.bandcamp.com/</p>\n\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>The game supports both keyboard+mouse and Xbox controllers (Should support PS4 controllers as well)! I highly recommend playing on a controller if possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement: left thumbstick or WASD</p>\n<p>Pickup objects: (Y) or F</p>\n<p>Interact: (X) or E</p>\n<p>How to Play -</p>\n<p>The pocket dimension experiments led to the creation of Pandora Cubes, self-contained pocket dimensions inside of boxes. Pick up Pandora Cube and drop it into a Cube Slot, then you can Interact and you will be teleported inside the pocket dimension! Pandora Cubes can contain Pandora Cubes inside them, and the further down you go, the weirder the dimensions are going to get. When you go far enough down some cubes will be Powered. If all cubes in a dimension are Powered and in Cube Slots, the cube containing the dimension will become powered, and you will be teleported back outside that cube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38ca3d81e72b151fa9170fcc61ef7211.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fonics"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
