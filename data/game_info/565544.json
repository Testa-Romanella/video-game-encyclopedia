{"id": 565544, "slug": "juan-miguel-in-the-city", "name": "Juan Miguel in the City", "name_original": "Juan Miguel in the City", "description": "<p>This game is a result of a personal objective that I\u2019ve set up for myself during the quarantine of 2020. The aim was for me to learn from scratch Pixel Art, Unity and C# programming language. Passionate about drawing techniques and filmmaking since an early age, I am very interested in building a career in the world of videogames. To me, this represents a great platform where I can combine my drawing, storytelling and programming skills, tackling both the artistic aspect of it as well as building the code to tell a story.</p>\n<p>\u2018Juan Miguel in the city\u2019 was a very challenging project for me, where I have invested a lot of time, work and energy. It\u2019s a short game (20-40 minutes), full of obstacles that you,\u00a0 a little boy called Juan Miguel, must face in order to survive. I am eager to improve, any constructive feedback or advise is more than welcomed. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy playing it!
