Full Version", "description": "<p>Roust, a medieval arcade game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum (currently for 128k only, soon to be\u00a048k)</p>\n<p>Greetings, and thankyou for downloading Roust for the ZX Spectrum, and supporting homebrew\u00a0development.</p>\n<p>This is the full version which contains most of the features you would expect including Egg\u00a0Wave, Survival Wave, Lava Troll and Pterodactyl, and of course gets steadily harder the further\u00a0you progress. The only feature missing is two player mode, and I fully intend to implement that\u00a0at a later stage and make it free for anyone who has bought the game. At that point a physical\u00a0copy on tape should also be available.</p>\n<p>As with Terrapins, it will include another game, just as soon as I have finished it, and that will be made available to anyone who buys this one.</p>\n<p>Big thanks go to David Saphier for converting the music and implementing the sound effects, as\u00a0well as helping with some important coding details. Thanks also to Craig Howard once more for\u00a0his excellent loading screen.</p>\n<p>Expect another arcade conversion from me fairly soon, but in the meantime, I hope you enjoy\u00a0Roust as much as I have enjoyed making it for you.</p>\n<p>Best wishes and happy gaming</p>\n<p>Allan<br/><br/></p><p>P.S Update - also included is a special ZX81 birthday edition of Roust featuring ZX81 style graphics and no sound!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53ef8f42ec9b00ece3410db141eecd74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["highriser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
