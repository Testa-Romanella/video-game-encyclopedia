Overall, society is being oppressed by a globalist government. All citizens must abide by even the simplest of laws - otherwise death is the consequence. the government has mandated all citizen across the globe must get microchipped for further security measures. More citizens have died to the government and law enforcement's mistreatment than the things they are trying to \"protect\" them from. There have even been radio towers put up all across the globe that increase the hunger and thirst-rate of an un-microchipped person, causing many to starve or die of thirst if they opposed the globalist governments' new laws.</p>\r\nGOAL\r\n<p>Your goal is to try escape the city in 15 minutes before all security cameras come back online. Once that happens, all security will swarm after you. Talk to other NPCs who are interactable to further progress or get some more info. Find Human Food and Canned Water to fill up your hunger and thirst percentage - you're not microchipped, so you decay quickly.</p>\n<p><em>BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE '<strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong>' SECTION IN THE MAIN MENU TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY! :)</em></p><p><em>ALSO, CROUCH-JUMPING IS USEFUL IF YOU FIND IT HARD JUMPING ON BIGGER CRATES.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you enjoy - consider donating :)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b02cd39eee7c5703eda66061ca3985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Shelton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
