Thanks for playing\u00a0 and we hope you enjoy the game.\u00a0 :D\u00a0 -Jknator. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUILD 09</strong><br/></p>\n<p>fixed all the bugs and added a splash screen... this is cool</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 08</strong></p>\n<p>finished up the credits and added the music and sound effects which are AMAZING!! I can't believe this game is real :0</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 07</strong></p>\n<p>wow I'm super tired it's 4am at the time of uploading wtf someone save meeeee</p>\n<p>anyway I did a credits screen that I'm happy with and also the game now gets harder as it goes on!!! I\u00a0think I'm pretty much ready to call this done, just need to add music and sound tomorrow.. uh oh</p>\n<p>oh also the credits screen is full of placeholders right now because my partner is understandably asleep</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 06</strong></p>\n<p>oops I accidentally did not work on this for like 5 days ahhhh anywayssss I'm back and better than ever. I\u00a0added a main menu screen and an enemy!!! the movement on the enemy still kinda sucks but I'm gonna playtest and fix it tomorrow hopefully</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 05</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, I guess I\u00a0needed some sleep. Here's a tip: if you're spending hours on a bug, go the fuck to sleep, you'll solve it in the morning. Anyway, I finally figured out how to make the UI elements work in different aspect ratios!! the game works on all screens!! I mean it's definitely\u00a0<em>prettier</em> in 4:3 (how it's\u00a0<em>meant</em> to be played) but it works on inferior resolutions too &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>the game has a PARALLAX background now (i know right!??!?) and just looks prettier in\u00a0 general. this was the aesthetic update</p>\n<p>EDIT: for some reason on the first run the background looks really ugly, just kill yourself and play again and the background will look as intended. I wonder what that's about... I guess I have another bug to fix tomorrow :,,)</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 04</strong></p>\n<p>lava has a cool texture now, and it actually kills you!! and there's a brand-new death screen that lets you replay the game without refreshing!!! unfortunately the main menu doesn't exist yet so the button doesn't take you anywhere.</p>\n<p>P.S. I\u00a0closed unity without saving when I was practically finished this build so I\u00a0had to restart everything UGH</p>\n<p>ALSO I HATE UI ELEMENTS. HOW DO THEY SCALE TO DIFFERENT SCREENS? I DON'T GET IT. I SPENT HOURS WORKING ON IT AND THE DEATH SCREEN\u00a0<em>STILL</em> DOESN'T COVER THE WHOLE SCREEN UIFHAIEFHIUSADFIS</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 03</strong></p>\n<p>okay okay a buncha bug fixes. movement should be smoother now, no more soaring through the air when you wall jump, and the lava is actually visible now!! I\u00a0bet you all thought I was crazy last time I mentioned the lava huh? it was there, it was just invisible outside the editor :(</p>\n<p>oh oh also now there's awesome textures for the platforms and blocks, AND a score tracker!! isn't UI amazing :0</p>\n<p>next thing I\u00a0work on will be the death screen, currently dying is just kinda awkward. oops</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 02</strong></p>\n<p>testing out the rising stage mechanic. the \"lava\" doesn't actually kill you yet, but it\u00a0<em>does</em> make the game impossible to play, so it counts ?<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>BUILD 01</strong></p>\n<p>first build of my first ever game jam game, just testing out the movement and apple animation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf28d7997987c76c393dab0233d6f67e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sofiregu", "Jknator"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
