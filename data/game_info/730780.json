The propagation of electromagnetic radiation is analysed using wave theory but its interaction with matter is described in terms of photons. The condition of particles such as electrons, neutrons, and atoms is described in terms of de Broglie waves TL;DR: things only exist in physicality when observed. We made a puzzle game about this.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sam Prewitt\r\n</p>\n<p>Seb Scaife\r\n</p>\n<p>James Price\r\n</p>\n<p>Nadia Nadeem\r\n</p>\n<p>Cal\r\n</p>\n<p>Blackrose\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bbbdb3a8cefd70ebf57bcb08a61ff5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paddog", "modking09", "Nadia Nadeem", "James Price", "Iamblackrose"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
