As our final project, our group of five had about six weeks to clone the game as best we could, without ripping any asset from the game (except the font), meaning that everything seen is custom made.</p>\n<p>Controls: Use WASD to move, arrows to rotate the camera, SPACE to jump. Hold SHIFT while running to long jump, and SHIFT +\u00a0SPACE to do the backflip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To win, jump in the pipe! For a surprise, grab all 8 red coins and get the star!</p><p>Teammates: Andrew, Ariana (Me), Connor, Emma, Nick.\u00a0</p><p>Additional help: Mario VO (my uncle), and music was collaborated with my friend Angelina.</p>\n<p>Note: For some reason, the background music won't loop in WebGL, but is fine in other builds and in the project itself (see video below).\u00a0</p>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6e1fd19907ffc6cdcdc50e40bbd5c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alb812"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
