There are many areas for you to explore through in its semi-linear layout, with the goal being to acquire five uniquely colored keys. Each key corresponds to one of the colors you'll have access to throughout the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game's puzzles all involve both manipulating color and time itself, with rewinding time to change color being an important technique. You'll need to constantly transform into new colors to bypass obstacles and progress further.\u00a0Platforming also is critical to succeeding, as you'll be challenged to overcome complicated moving platforms, wall-jump, and more.\u00a0<strong>Time to Recolor</strong> is ideally beaten in a single casual session, with completion time averaging around thirty to sixty minutes. There is a game timer visible at the end for those who want an extra challenge in speedrunning the levels.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy playing <strong>Time to Recolor</strong>, please feel free to provide me with your thoughts or feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da6a09be64a1ec30d9ec642e617abb58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PhantomDonut"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
