Try to escape the facility while you're malfunctioning. You'll break down every few seconds, and have to adjust yourself to new controls, displayed in the bottom left of the screen.

When the screen shakes, the controls change.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>The controls are not randomized, they're patterns. You can keep your hand in the same shape as WASD and move it to the next set of controls based on the top letter.</li><li>You cannot die by touching the back wall, try to press against it to give yourself the most time possible.</li><li>Your limbs don't interact with obstacles, only your body and head do.</li><li>There is no end and the game gets harder overtime by increasing control sensitivity. Aim for a high score!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8df83623b21669694dc7cbbed3c1f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Urban Slug"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
