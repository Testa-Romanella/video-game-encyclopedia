Their are two types of enemies you will encounter, the first being a slime and the second being a fly. To defeat both you simply have to jump on top of them, then there's the spike traps. As it stands there are three levels, I intend to make more levels to the game in the future.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T03:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/194/19464e07d7d508034e273556d38cef0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kalpitiyo", "Robert Murphy-Hosler"], "genres": ["Casual", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Robert Murphy-Hosler"], "esrb_rating": null}
