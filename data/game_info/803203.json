Holding the direction into a wall while colliding will allow a wall jump with the necessary upgrade.\u00a0Down is to change to the shadow form (Be careful to not do this accidentally.) While up is to revert back to the formed shadow. This can only be done from the unformed shadow shape.</p>\n<p>Press 'X' when touching an enemy while an\u00a0unformed shadow to change into them! This comes with different abilities and movement capabilities. This works as the main function button for each state.\u00a0Pressing the down arrow will change this form back to the shadow, so be careful.</p>\n<p>'Z' can often activate special powers. Press this while running as a pangolin to roll and wall bounce. This also activates the sword while a fully formed shadow (as long as you have found the sword.) In the unformed state, this will open the menu for shape-shifting on command.

I used a platformer template I made for the basics. A special thanks and credit to\u00a0Pancelor\u00a0for their creation of the big map editor for Pico-8 that allowed me to make such a large map. As well as\u00a0Rik Cross, whose youtube tutorials were instrumental.    The map is a little weird overall. It is my first time making a whole map, and even really a complete (mostly) game.<br/></p>Notes<p>I worked on this for a relatively short time period, so it is a little glitchy. I am turning this in right at the deadline, so some things are not implemented or working correctly. This proved to be a big feat with Pico-8 for me, and I ended up going over the token limit way too often at the end.</p>\n\r\n~Oz O'Shea", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fe77e64b582ca80d1b1feadb49e33aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oswin O.
