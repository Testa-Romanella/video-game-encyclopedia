You will have to use your arsenal of weapons more than once.<br/><br/>Plunging into the world of the game, you have to explore abandoned places: towns, villages, factories and facilities, skeletons of buildings and waste-grounds.<br/><br/>On your trek, you will face to the harsh conditions of post-apocalyptic weather: toxic precipitation, storms, fogs and optical phenomena. Special devices will help you to overcome them.<br/><br/>The more inclement weather outside the window, the more comfortable it is in the shelter and the more acutely the romanticism of the post-apocalypse is felt. Sometimes, during the next toxic pouring rain or suffocating radioactive fog, it is better to stay under the roof, surrounded by the warm light of kerosene lamps and the steady hum of the air filter. At such moments, you can start preparing for the next foray or, for example, do \"radio stalking\", tuning the special device to open and encoded radio frequencies in search of information, music, images, video or dialogue.<h3>graphics and Technical Aspects:</h3>The game is powered by GZDoom, the modern port of the classic Doom engine. <br/>The visual style of the game is combines a realism and elements of the classic graphics such as sprites.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-27T17:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09f/09f6e2f1aedb23bf4e60aa1b912fb2f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amanito Computing"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Amanito Computing"], "esrb_rating": null}
