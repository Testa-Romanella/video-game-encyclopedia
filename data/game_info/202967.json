A friend of mine in Italy started a hashtag <strong>#quellavoltache</strong> (<em>that \r\ntime when</em>) and women all over the country just used it to share their \r\nharrassment experiences. I figured\r\n            I wanted to do something about that.</p>\n<p>And one of the main points that emerged through discussions\r\n with peers and friends has been how the patriarchal culture affects men\r\n as much as women. We are from start deeply immersed in this idea of \r\npower play; that happens so much that we\r\n            often lose the meaning of context. We just take it for \r\ngranted, it becomes an axiom.</p>\n<p>So what we tried to do is to build a simple narrative which\r\n could illustrate how this culture is damaging for everyone. And \r\nhopefully make people think about how they become better allies just \r\nputting the whole context into discussion. So then\r\n            this sentence by Albert Camus sums up our intents:</p>\n<p>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.</p>\n<p> Let\u2019s do that act of rebellion.
