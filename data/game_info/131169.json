No distractions or spin off modes, just you, an empty board with hidden mines and your intuition...and a bit of luck at the start!</p>\n<p>Compete with your friends to see who can find the most amount of mines in the shortest space of time both locally and online on a global leader-board. Alternatively take your time to hone your mine finding skills by going past 'Hard' mode and setting your own map size and mine count.</p>\n<p>And the best thing is...totally FREE! No payments or ADs just the game. (I mean you can donate a little something for coffee IF you enjoy the things I make and want to see more!)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse ,</li><li>Controller (XBox One Tested)</li><li>Touch</li></ul>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>3 preset difficulty modes + a custom difficulty mode</li><li>Musical scales Easter egg</li><li>Colour blind filters (untested, feedback appreciated)</li><li>Local &amp; Global Leaderboards (Social service dependant)</li></ul>\n<p>Coming Soon:</p>\n<ul><li>Microsoft Windows Store App with XBox Live Integration</li><li>Mac App Store with Game Center Integration</li><li>Android with Google Play Games Integration</li><li>iOS with Game Center Integration</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794aed00eadbafd4e1ccddc9a54eedf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Freddie Babord"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
