Is this adventurer even a hero? Is he even actually an adventurer? Who cares? Not the Crafting Goddess Joann, apparently! All she wants is a slave to make crap for her, and that slave appears to be this poor soul. I guess now that he's been chosen by a trans-dimensional entity to do some kind of bidding he doesn't really have a choice of sorts. <br/><br/>At least there's some fun to be had as he traverses the dungeons generated from your old high-school reports and questionable images. <br/><br/>Wait a second, did I just say old high-school reports?! They have value now? <br/>You sure bet! <br/><br/>You'll have to delve deep into your hard drive's dungeons to create the list of items the goddess has bestowed upon you to create. All the dungeons are randomly generated from the files that you select on your hard drive, with bigger files creating bigger dungeons, and different file types designating different kinds of loot you can find. Items, craftables, and monsters all have generated names with randomly selected adjectives attached. Even the requirements to make the crafted items are random! <br/> Use every menu and tool at your disposal to collect items and serve the goddessFeatures<ul><li>Randomly generated dungeons based on your files <br/></li><li>Randomly generated items <br/></li><li>BOSS FIGHTS <br/></li><li>An unpredictable play time<br/></li><li>Being able to play with one hand with a beer in the other<br/></li><li>Multiple ways to reach your goal<br/></li><li>Hand drawn pixel art made with love and care</li></ul>Spoiler Alert Ahead!  You have been warned!C:\\raft is a homage to the Rogue and JRPG genres, while being an easily accessible and expansive experience.  Within minutes you can already be collecting tons of loot, exploring your hard drive, and dying.  The game features practically no story, but many ways to play, some of which only unlock after beating the game at least once, and its crafting experience is no more than a glorified fetch quest.  That said, there's still plenty to sink tons of time into, as it's a lightweight experience that can be played during a coffee break.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fdec919bf7f9c9f87de410d7c8719ab1.jpg", "website": "https://nhydock.github.io/Storymode", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 40, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nicholas Hydock"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Hydock"], "esrb_rating": null}
