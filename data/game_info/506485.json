Neither have I, and I highly doubt that this experience will change either of our minds. Still, the opportunity now presents itself... there's only one ending, but if you embark on this journey, you'll be able to ask Cassie whatever questions you'd like.*<br/></p>\n<p>This game draws inspiration from the \"smart cinema\" movement in film. This is definitely a funny game, but though players are meant to laugh as they play it, some of the comedic moments are also uncomfortable. In classic\u00a0 smart cinema style, the game encourages the player to remain\u00a0emotionally detached from the characters. This effect is achieved by portraying characters as unpredictable and spontaneous. Both the player and the characters can (and will) insult each other and say cringe-worthy things, making them seem\u00a0more like actual humans than video game characters who speak with regard for narrative or direction.\u00a0 This results in\u00a0dialogue that is direct and painfully\u00a0honest.\u00a0Though it's hard to \"like\" characters who behave this way (thus the detachment), it is possible to \"feel bad\" for them... creating yet another uncomfortable situation for the player to laugh at.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in about 24 hours for the Game &amp; Media Entertainment Developers (GAMED) club's second game jam of the 2019/20 academic year. There are some inside references that only attendees of this game jam will \"get,\" but I\u00a0don't believe they detract from the game's overall storytelling efficacy. The theme of the game jam was \"meta,\" and the modifier was \"duos.\" I took the pair modifier a step further and created this game alone. I\u00a0did all of the art, sound effects, music, design, programming, and storytelling for this game within the temporal parameters of the game jam, and I\u00a0made all of the assets from scratch.</p>\n<p>This game was made in Unity and written in C# in Microsoft Visual Studio. The score was composed in Noteflight, and the visual art was made in Pixlr. Also, all dialogue is nonfiction; any information about me contained in this game is true, and all of the events referenced actually happened. Don't judge me.</p>\n<p>* Assuming that the question(s) you'd like to ask were written into the dialogue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5d/f5d0b5eafb135a5693797223c7130b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cass Aleatory"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
