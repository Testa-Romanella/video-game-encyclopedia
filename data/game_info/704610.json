{"id": 704610, "slug": "turnkitchen", "name": "TurnKitchen", "name_original": "TurnKitchen", "description": "<p>A turn-based restaurant sim with very simple controls - you only have 2 keys. You must do everything with only those 2 keys and you should try to minimize your moves - one bad move can send you back 4 more. It's a simple idea that I\u00a0think has some potential. I got late into the \"MiniJam 94\" so it's in a really rough state with only the basic functionality implemented (I think I spent on it like 8-ish hours) but even in their simple state they can be easily extended with more assets (cooking is pretty robust, just time-consuming to add all the recipes and ingredients).<br/><br/>It's really, really, really basic right now but I\u00a0really think that core mechanics can be a lot of fun (especially on mobile) if I'll add for example a scoring system where you get points the less moves you make. There's also possibility of moving on 3D grid and with some camera movement that would make it harder for player to orient where he should be facing. I'd like for it to have this chessy feeling like something like \"Hitman GO\").<br/><br/>I didn't have time to implement any type of tutorial (and pretty much nothing except the core mechanic)\u00a0so if you want to try it you should read this:<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Since there are only 2 buttons (Action1 - Q, Action2 - E)\u00a0available they do different things depending on player's state.<br/><br/>If player is simply walking:<br/>Action1 - Walk Forward<br/>Action2 - Rotate 90 degrees to right<br/><br/>If player is facing interactive object:<br/>Action1 - Interact with the object<br/>Action2 - Rotate 90 degrees to right<br/><br/>If player is using any kind of menu:<br/>Action1 - Confirm/Select/Enter<br/>Action2 - Go to next option (If current option is the last one, exit from current menu)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Interactive objects</strong>:<br/><br/><strong>Counter</strong>:<br/>If it's empty and you have food on your hand - you will put it on the counter<br/>If you don't have anything in your hand and there is food on the counter - you will take it<br/>If you have food in hand and on the counter it will try to mix them together according to recipes.<br/><br/><strong>Fridge</strong>:<br/>You will be able to select a basic ingredient from it. Infinite use.</p>\n<p><strong>Oven</strong>:<br/>If you use with food in your hand It will try to start cooking it. If it's full or the food is not cookable it will do nothing. If you use it with empty hand it will give you the last food that you put on it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Trash</strong>:<br/>It will remove food that you are currently holding.<br/><br/><strong>Cash register</strong>:<br/>If you use with food in your hand it will try to finish first matching order.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Recipes:</strong><br/>White Bread +\u00a0Cheese = Bread with Cheese<br/>Bread with Cheese + White Bread = Cheese Sandwitch<br/>Cheese\u00a0Sandwitch +\u00a0Oven = Grilled Cheese<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e18eeaf62902ca528f4de07e078d317f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KTGxyz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
