{"id": 276448, "slug": "electric-tango", "name": "Electric Tango", "name_original": "Electric Tango", "description": "<p>This game was originally made for the 1 Hour Game Jam 173.\u00a0\u00a0You can play that version\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>You are the hand of Zeus. \u00a0While Zeus has been off seducing the ladies, he has sent you to go collect lightning bolts for him. Dodge bombs, collect lightning bolts, and collect batteries for more energy to collect more lightning bolts. \u00a0Your score is dependent on how many you can collect!</p>\n<p>This version is in progress to be a mobile port. \u00a0It has many features over the 1hgj version, but unfortunately, it has a lot of work to go before I\u00a0consider a real release on mobile.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Voice-over report of your progress, featuring my brother on vocals!</li><li>Better graphics!\u00a0\u00a0(But not all graphics replaced. \u00a0And not all are better.)</li><li>More awesome music!</li><li>Collectable bonus letters!</li></ul>\n<p>Progress needed:</p>\n<ul><li>I'm currently using the\u00a0Unity physics engine; but it really should be rewritten to not use physics.</li><li>The graphics have not yet won any awards; most should be replaced.</li><li>All the plans for what happens when you collect those bonus letters have not yet been implemented. Currently you get a 2x score multiplier when you collect them all.</li><li>Memory allocation should be made much much more efficient. \u00a0We are still using the game jam code! \u00a0It doesn't do object pooling! \u00a0What is this?</li><li>I should make the start of the game much easier. \u00a0I see people who haven't played it yet struggle to get started.</li><li>The buttons are decreed \"ugly\" by my wife and must be changed.</li><li>I believe the web version refuses to access the high score board. \u00a0That is available on mobile only.</li><li>Also, entering your name in the high score board needs to be completely fixed. And is also ugly.</li></ul>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Move the mouse (or if on mobile, swipe the screen) to yourself (ie, the hand on the screen) left or right. \u00a0Collect lightning bolts for score. \u00a0The green bar at the bottom is a timer of how much time you have to collect bolts; collect batteries to refill the bar. \u00a0When you collect a battery, your score multiplier will increase. Also, when you collect a battery, the objects drop faster.</p>\n<p>If you would like to test beta test the mobile version, please email monopogon@polypogon.com! \u00a0A sekrit code for you to install in your mobile device will be sent to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a2b92fd341c85040efbcb7d31c75e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Polypogon Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
