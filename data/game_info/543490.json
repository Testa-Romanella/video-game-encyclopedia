But as soon as he teleported to the swamps, disaster struck! The teleport broke and its parts were scattered all over the swamp. Now, in addition to medicinal herbs, he still needs to find and collect parts of the teleport in order to be able to leave the swamps.<br/>But be careful! The swamp has its dangers.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>This short game was made on Pico-8</em><br/></p>\n\n\r\nThe game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, high. When the player leaves the swamp through the teleport, he goes to +1 difficulty level. That is, there are only 3 consecutive levels in the game.\r\nThe player needs to collect all the parts of the teleport (2) to move to the next level. There are no restrictions on the number of medicinal herbs collected, but the more collected the better ! :)\r\nIn the future, the game may have improvements and changes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/13873e680263c0b14bcea50a2e14f872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ViGuselt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
