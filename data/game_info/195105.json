I have tracked it down, and discovered a single line of code, which i moved. The culprit was a line that delivered damage to the player anytime an enemy collided with another enemy; something i accounted for, but put in the wrong place in the last 10 minute crunch before uploading. That is why many features aren't implemented (like how much health you have left).</p><p>I consider this a game-breaking bug, and hope you agree that fixing it does not violate the spirit of the Ludum Dare 32 Compo. Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/66548be4c0eb6f144334a873e9f18085.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["OneTrueAaron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
