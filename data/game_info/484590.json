In fact, the hushed whispers and paranoia<br/>have grown so readily that the office now shuts it doors promptly<br/>at seven o'clock each night--the same hour this child comes out to play.<br/><br/>One night, Jun Tsukimiya, the corporation's chairman, oversleeps at his<br/>desk and is left alone on the cusp of dusk. And what does this child say<br/>to him when they finally meet?<br/><br/>\"You know nothing, Jun Tsukimiya.\"<br/><br/>Just what is it that he doesn't know? Whatever it is, the clock is stuck<br/>at seven, and he has little choice but to find out.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84a7c282a4bd8f3709a1cc53a1a47cca.jpg", "website": "http://c3games.webcrow.jp/yoiyami_top.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C3 Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["C3 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
