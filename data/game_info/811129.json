Surrounded by farmland and inhabited by teachers, it is a self-sustaining where beginner adventurers and magic practitioners that have yet to control their abilities start off their transformative journeys in this town. Whether it is to make a difference in both the magical sector and the mortal world or to travel the world to stave off illustrious vampire covens, it is dubbed the birthplace of hope. One day, in 2006, peace in Baudelaire City had been disrupted by nightly wolf attacks. The pack prowl through the streets, ready to attack any creature it perceives as vulnerable. Some livestock have gone missing, residents lose their pets, children have been abducted, shops have been ransacked, and the village\u2019s university has locked its doors to visitors. Elijah, a master vampire hunter that helped vanquish Vlad the Impaler in the 1960s, travels to Baudelaire City to find answers. Accompanying him as part of their training are his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s; Frederick, Eforie, and Taner. Neither, as it appears, possess any magical prowess so their adroitness in combat is under question, though Elijah has hope his wisdom for them will click and he is certain the wolf attacks may be the kids\u2019 first real lesson in understanding that the world is cruel and facing its obstacles head-on is the only path to survival. Only their performance will determine if Elijah will truly succeed as a mentor and more importantly, save the village.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b89647589e8dd3f327fdca6861aa224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Westley Nelson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
