Playing as Em, a young bird who has just completed their first solitary migration, you rejoin family and friends at an annual spring festival where you catch up with one another through dance. Experiment with how you express yourself and how that affects your discussions and relationships with others who may not dance quite the\u00a0same way.</p>\n<p><em>With Flowers Comes Dance</em> is the thesis project I made at the NYU Game Center, which encapsulates my love of both narrative and music-centric games.</p>\n<p>Currently tested and supported controllers include:</p>\n<p>PlayStation DualShock 4 wireless controller (Mac and PC)</p>\n<p>Xbox One Controller (PC only)</p>\n<p>Other gamepads may work, but have not been tested for support!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A special thanks to\u00a0Hosni, who helped immensely on the shader work!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T14:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0ad019b1cd13003fa20bb10ed6cc421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Alessia Ianni-Palarchio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
