The goal of the jam was to make one to four player minigames like Mario Party or WarioWare. It's a very sarcastic game in the vain of WarioWare but formatted like Robot Chicken, with sarcastic jokes transitioned bluntly by television static. All the minigames are controlled solely with the arrow keys and space bar. One of the challenges is figuring out how to play each game. The goal is to master each minigame and complete them in series without failing. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RomanRobot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
