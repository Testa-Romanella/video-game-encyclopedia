It was done in 3h37 instead of 3h, still overtime but a net improvement from last week. Two hours for the gameplay development and 1h30ish for art creation and polishing. I reused the dithering filter from a previous project to gain some time.</p>\n<p>Music is to credit to @abstrkt. Huge thanks to him! Please consider checking what he does on his website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6ebb3392cfda8163e31adadad6811f39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KinoxKlark", "abstrkt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
