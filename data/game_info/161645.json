In fact they were happy only when they jumped. And ate. Two types of candies were a specialty for them: little stars and little hearts. The hearts were very special, if they ate enough of them, they were so happy that they radiate a shield around them which protected them from hits. And they were whacked because they could jump high and very high, sometimes they even performed somersaults.</p><p>Now their fate is in your fingers. <br/>Jump! Eat!
