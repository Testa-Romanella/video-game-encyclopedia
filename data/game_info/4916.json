Use your skill and reflexes to destroy chains of colored orbs and deadly gun turrets.\r\n\r\nEliminate orbs with your colored lasers to expose the turrets and blow them out of orbit, but avoid the homing missiles and cannon fire that threaten your fragile ship. One missed laser could break your combo in this classic score-chasing action-puzzle game!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nStellar Attack\u00a92010 Laughing Jackal Ltd.
