Two heroes braving a dangerous (and dare I say cute?) world together!\u00a0Buff Man can punch but can't jump. Jump Man is quick but can't fight. Using the strengths of each, solve retro pixel platform levels.<br/></p>\n<p>The game fits the theme because the player controls two heroes a la Ice Climbers, the classic gaming duo. All the puzzles require a pair to solve, and each hero cannot work without the other one.</p>\n<p>Assets from:<br/> https://freesounds.org,\u00a0<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360,<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-2-155418,<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/mine-tileset-43476</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c57a0f168788039686fbd46823425a2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metapilgrim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
