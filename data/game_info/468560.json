I used this opportunity to clean up the code I used previously and also tried to implement the idea of having this swarm like entity that moves almost like a fluid. Originally, I wanted it so that it would move automatically and the player's job was to change the shape of the swarm but it took too long so I scraped it. For this game,\u00a0I also wanted to make the audio a bigger part of the feeling of the game, so I decided to use recorded sounds.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some assets were made entirely by me (Turrets, player character ...). However, I did use this tileset (https://finalbossblues.itch.io/tf-jungle-tileset) which I modified slightly to make it fit the game. I also used some recorded sounds that my friend provided.\u00a0The font used is Retron.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Left-click to jump between objects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space to interact with text boxes and menu screens.</p>\n\r\nMy other games:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074af258aada7264b597e4571960c0e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["trust_me"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
