If you find them all you'll regain your memories.</p>\n<p>Optional Combat: You can go through the entire game without fighting any enemies. In fact, the boss won't appear unless you kill all the other enemies. Do note, though, that the boss is difficult, and is made harder if you collected all the secrets.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun, and please leave me any feedback you might have on the game. If you think it's great, please tell me why it's great, if you think it's garbage, please tell me why it's garbage. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8cadf389088ab83b70f4923153dfb7ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TommyGunGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
