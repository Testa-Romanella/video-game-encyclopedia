When I found Bitsy as a game editor I finally was able to set my eyes on something much smaller, and the room that gave me for creativity actually set me up to go farther beyond the scope of what I was originally planning. I hope to bring this kind of reflective and compassionate energy to my game designs in the future. The big \"self care moment\" came when a day before submissions were due, I found out Bitsy had put into their engine the ability to program in \"items\" your character can find, and it was very tempting for me to find out how this segment of the editor worked and try to program in one more aspect to my game before submitting. But instead, I am saving that for a future project, and submitting early, because that feels very nice :)</p>\n<p>For more of my work, you can check out www.ruune.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db4d476464bb9c19ceec2059cc081ac8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruune"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
