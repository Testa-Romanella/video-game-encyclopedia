We always try to get better and better but can't work on games on our spare time usually, so game jams are the best moments for us.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this time we didn't have full freedom, so some of us had to leave a lot of hours and our dedication was minimal. So we didn't manage to present a fully working game, but most of the systems are in place and ready.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope at least you like the small amount of work you can test!<br/></p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>The main idea of the game was building your dice with different attacks, like a deck-building game, but with luck affecting which one of the attacks you get to execute on each turn. There were planned different systems to allow different ways to play (slowly damaging enemies via poison, tanking enemies, a glass cannon build that takes time to load but can obliterate), and a rogue-lite system to improve your build over the rounds.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, both the dice-building and the rewards aren't working as expected. So, right now this is just an RPG with square attacks that could be on a dice but aren't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, the enemies are bugged and self-attack instead of attacking the player :)</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Art, Animations, Design - Axel Cebri\u00e1n (@pexawnly)<br/>Development (Cards and Dice) - Antonio Morales (@MeanL00ki)<br/>Development (Battle System) - Marc L\u00f3pez (@NaraJeamfry)<br/>Development (Menus and Various Systems), Sound, Music - Guillermo Pradas (@GillTheDev)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/312a45a9fab4943f07a5d9ac7b9a70f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Nara Jeamfry"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
