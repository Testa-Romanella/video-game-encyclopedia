While it's in stable condition and fully playable (though missing a lot of sound effects and music), I\u00a0plan some minor tweaks and extra additions down the road to make the gameplay more varied, perhaps even re-draw some of the first-day cats I got in there. I just wanted to finish something, really, and challenge myself to implement fun ideas. I'll return to this project, keep it as a sort of a 'tutorial base' to master new code. Please report any bugs you find! There's one currently involving very small kittens that I'm working on, but the code's being difficult.</p>\n<p>For the next release, I want to add a leaderboard saved locally, then figure out how to host an online one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaa994bb957fd1e8926c654603aaca90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bearhunter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
