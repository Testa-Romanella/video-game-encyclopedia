You can control friendly reprogrammed programs and connect them into more powerful structures. You can also make nearby friendly programs move toward your position. But beware, with time corrupted programs will detect you and start moving toward you.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype that demonstrates base mechanics. Full release intends to have upgrades for your constructions, more levels, and quality improvements we\u2019ll deem necessary based on feedback.</p>\n<p>PC version is recommended over HTML5, though HTML5 is largely stable (<strong>EDIT: as it has turned out, Gatekeeper level currently does not work on HTML5</strong>). However, we recommend not returning to the main menu but refreshing the page. Also, the final level will work slowly on HTML5 (though that makes it easier).</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>WASD \u2013 movement\r\n  </li><li>Mouse left click \u2013 controlling nearby programs\r\n  </li><li>Ctrl \u2013 calling nearby programs (can be alt on HTML5, to prevent ctrl+w)\r\n  </li><li>R \u2013 restart the level.\r\n  </li><li>Enter \u2013 select menu option/start next level\r\n  </li><li>Esc - pause\r\n  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T07:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b15e82210a0df8aa1245449e235c6232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Placeholder Name Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
