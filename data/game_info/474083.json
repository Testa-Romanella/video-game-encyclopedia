In 2017 the project files were recovered and ported to GameMaker: Studio so they could be remastered. The finished product was first released to Game Jolt on the 23rd of February with an original soundtrack, new backgrounds, sprite cleaning, a better score tracking system and screen wrapping, and has since been mirrored here. The score tracking operates on frames that inputs are held down for, so you could use a TAS to get the highest possible score.<br/></p>\n<p>Everything in blockMania was created by me, Jack5.
