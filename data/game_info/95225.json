BOTOLO is a fast paced mindreading competition, a dance inside the negative space between your opponent's thoughts. Mind-wrestle your opponents into submission inside hypnotic fields of pattern and color. Steal the ball and protect it from your opponent in this hybrid game of keepaway and king-of-the-hill. </p><p>No friends? No problem. BOTOLO has built-in, state-of-the-art friend simulations! Granted, these incredible programs might not appreciate the simple beauty of a sunset, or lend you a reassuring hug in a time of need, but they DO adapt to your playstyle mid-match, which is almost as good.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f30a9f68380293eea61e26188092397c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["iansnyder"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
