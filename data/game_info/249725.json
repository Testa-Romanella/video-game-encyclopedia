(There is no guarantee with compatibility with older or newer versions of Game Maker)<br/><br/><strong>Why a gameplay engine/simulator?</strong><br/>A summoning, experience, materials, and other F/GO sims already have been done. So this is the natural result of the progression.<br/>A gameplay simulator offers these benefits:<br/>Practice using Servants<br/>Practice using Craft Essences<br/>Practice different Battle scenarios such as Events<br/>Playing with totally new or different things that are not in the base game<br/><br/>This is NOT meant to replace the base experience of the mobile game. It will not have robust animations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Why open source?</strong><br/>Well, Fate/Grand Order isn't mine and this is purely a fan game.<br/>Open source makes it possible to add dream Servants, Skills, Craft Essences that you and I want to see in the game, for mods, for others helping to make better simulator, or adapt it to their own uses.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06f/06f493b10ceccdb283f0d605bc6bd2de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gmx0"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
