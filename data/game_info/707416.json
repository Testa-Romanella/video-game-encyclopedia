Earth is scanned by aliens living in galaxies away. The aliens have over exploited their own galaxy critically which results in the death of thousands of stars. The aliens have to find a new home for themselves with fruitful resources. After discovering Earth, they announced to the human society that their fleet will arrive in no more than 50 years. Human civilization fell into a dire situation overnight. Humans can either choose to struggle desperately by quickly building their own spaceship fleet to fight with the aliens, or choose interstellar immigration.</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>In The Twilight Era, there is multiple boards for games to play with. The boards are all completely different from each other. They have different sizes, different arrangements, different background images, different piece textures, different directions, etc. The most important thing is, they also have different rules to play with; however, these boards are cooperating with the game story. Explore and Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Select the piece you wan to move. The board will display the possible movement range of the selected piece. Then, choose one of the grids in the range as the move made by the piece. No regrets are allowed in the entire game, consider thoroughly before making the decision ;) Good Luck!<br/></p>\r\nWho We Are\r\n<p>SeriousGameDevTeam is a small studio composed of 6 people.
