Only a part of the planned story and content is in the game. We still think it's a cool experience worth trying out though!</strong><br/><br/>Mind Diver is a first-person detective game. You search a woman's memories for clues to solving the mystery of what happened to her boyfriend after a party. As a Mind Diver you explore an ocean of memories. Use your logical deduction skills to fill out holes in memories to restore them.<br/><br/>Mind Diver\u2019s unique investigation and deduction structure is developed in consultation with world-leaders in puzzle design, like <strong>Lucas Pope</strong>, creator of <strong>Return of the Obra Dinn</strong>. You will come across lots of unexpected discoveries and exploration of a fascinating mind world, with surprising deductions.<br/><br/>In Mind Diver, the story is the puzzle. Only by understanding the story can you progress.<br/><br/><strong>Fresh, expressive 3D-scan style</strong><br/>The style creates an authentic experience, packed with details to study and explore. Paying close attention to detail helps you solve puzzles and brings you closer to the characters of the game.<br/><br/><strong>Glimpses into a beautiful relationship</strong><br/><br/>The memories float around in larger-than-life surreal landscapes, each centered around an emotion: Heartbreak, Worry, Hope, Regret and more. Every solution to a memory reveals not only more of the story, but also more clues to the overarching mystery that you are trying to solve. Mind Diver will make you feel like an actual detective by only giving you the clues and asking you to make the connection.<br/><br/><strong>Pleasing and satisfying correction mechanic </strong><br/><br/>Memories are restored by using your logical deduction skill to fill out empty holes in memories. You can pick up anything, even people from the memory or a nearby memory and fill out black memory holes to uncover suppressed secrets. Explore the mind world and think ahead to make the correct decision.<br/><br/><strong>Satisfying, rhythmic swimming</strong><br/><br/>As a Mind Diver you can freely swim around the landscapes to explore the mind. With the implementation of a satisfying, rhythmic swimming mechanic you are in control of your swim speed.<br/><br/><strong>Helpful transportation slipstream</strong><br/><br/>The slipstream connects you between multiple memories.
