This is the first in a hopefully weekly series of two hour games where I, you guessed it, make a game in two hours. Or at least as close to a game as possible.</p>\n\n<p>--THIS WEEK--</p>\n<p>I was given:</p>\n<p>Little Men and Fish - @Sasha_Harvey</p>\n<p>Goblins - @emmaahume</p>\n<p>Twin-stick Shooter - @Icid0</p>\n<p>Tile/Grid based movement - @antlerdads</p>\n<p>80s Theme and Rollerskates -\u00a0 @YuuuPatsu<br/></p>\n<p>Snakes - @bbkate98</p><p>Explosions/funky gore - Discord</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>You are Mr 80's, fresh out of the 80's. You just wanna hang out in your grid but can't because there are a bunch of goblins fused with animals trying to ruin your fun. Throw shades at them so they can appreciate a better way of life. A vapor way-ve of life.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Directional Keys - Rotation</p>\n<p>Space - Throw glasses</p>\n\n<p>Game:</p>\n<p>Things only move when you do. Try to time your glasses to hit enemies.\u00a0 Rotating is free. Skates make you move further. I really don't know if that's a hindrance or not.</p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out my wak shit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eff/effb0ddc7947b5f0f3afc7f91d856b5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan - Showstopping Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
