At my father\u2019s death, I inherited a book filled with strange writings depicting the whole history of my cursed family one year at a time, one sentence per year. But I quickly noticed that while every boy's birth was noted, every girl's one was avoided, replaced by a odd writing \u201cBack at Valborgne\u201d. Studying the clues disseminated in the strange manuscripts, I obtained another book. Dark, filled with strangely tangled writings, the Necrophitescon yield its secrets to me. I learned about spells, invocations, sacrifices and demons.</p>\n<p>I directly headed to Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Valborgne to discover mysteries surrounding the Valborgne manor.
