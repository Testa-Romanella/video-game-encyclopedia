It has been made in 24H at the Technoport in Esch-Sur-Alzette, \u00a0Luxembourg.</p>\n<p>It's a 2vs2 game, the goal is to cooperate with the opposite player to score points against side players.</p>\n<p>To do that you can move your paddle left and right in your limited area, and you can also rotate your paddle in order to aim more precisely. The ball speed will increase a little bit after each bounce against a player's paddle,\u00a0\u00a0scoring will reset the speed.</p>\n<p>Note :\u00a0because of the lack of time, we couldn't implement the score system correctly, the paddle movements could also use some fine tuning.</p>\n\n<p>Team Gaijin members</p>\n<p>Ang\u00e9lique Labb\u00e9 : graphic designer<br/></p>\n<p>Yannic Kissel :\u00a0graphic designer - music and sound composer</p>\n<p>Lucas Milakovic : game designer</p>\n<p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Labb\u00e9 : developer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bbc0809e13b2b03915d754e271b506f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DisizDream"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
