{"id": 202303, "slug": "rylans-balloons", "name": "Rylan's Balloons", "name_original": "Rylan's Balloons", "description": "<p>This is a game I originally started creating\u00a0for my 4 year old\u00a0to teach him numbers and letters, but I thought others might find it enjoyable, so I'm posting it here. The goal is to pop only the numbered balloons, or only the lettered balloons, depending on the game mode. You have the option to either hover your mouse over the balloons to pop them, or click on them to pop them. There are also three difficulty levels in which the balloons will float upward faster the higher the\u00a0level. The balloons on the easiest level may seem really slow to most adults, but that level was designed with toddlers in mind, who seem to enjoy the pace. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p>\n<p>Feel free to try out the demo if you'd like. The demo includes one difficulty level, and only the \"Pop the Numbers\" mode.</p>\n<p>I'll be tweaking the game occasionally, and maybe adding new features, so if you run into any bugs along the way, feel free to send me an e-mail at xaeyr@hotmail.com and let me know! Please put \"balloons\"\u00a0in the subject line.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb4233502ddd47aec595297600484ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xaeyr"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
