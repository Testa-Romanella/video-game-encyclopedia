Back in 1918, the Little Baroness set off from Toluca Lake with 12 passengers, only to sink due to an unknown failure. The wreckage was never recovered and the reason for the accident was put down to \"some other reason\". Fast forward to 2001 and the Little Baroness is finally recovered from Toluca Lake. Shortly after this, strange things start to happen across the town and neighboring areas of Silent Hill. Tina, &amp; other members from the occult club at Ashfield High decide to investigate the wreckage recovery site only to find that what was lying at the lake's bottom wasn't just the Little Baroness, but whatever took it down with it.<br/><br/>PLAY THE FIRST PART OF THE GAME &amp; GET A FEEL FOR THE ATMOSPHERE!<br/><br/>THERE ARE 3 ENDINGS TO DISCOVER IN THIS DEMO.
