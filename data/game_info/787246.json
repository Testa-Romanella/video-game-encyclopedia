The apparent risks to the long term image of Dafty Toys Inc prove to be greater than the potential increase in profits.\r\nNotable risks include, rated by severity.\r\n1. - Government fines (Negligible)</p>\n<p>2. - Injury &amp; loss of company personnel &amp; third party employees. (Mild)\r\n</p>\n<p>3. - Loss of products due to consumer theft. (Mild)\r\n</p>\n<p>4. - Damage of production equipment &amp; transportation. (Moderate)\r\n</p>\n<p>5. - Settlements to reimburse clients for damage &amp; trauma. (Moderate)\r\n</p>\n<p>6. - Negative publicity ultimately leading to a decrease in customer sales. (Severe)\r\nIssues summarized from report 1147\r\n</p>\n<p>This is why we run test lines for new products. Even with such an unfortunately promising product. The novelty of a duck that moves and plays without needing sustenance, battery power, expensive components. Whilst still retaining that telltale rubber ducky shape &amp; texture Dafty Toys Inc is famous for. Regrettably, it appears that the spirits of passed ducks appear to be especially vengeful and powerful in larger numbers. Whilst smaller batches showed exciting results, manifestations of greater evil quickly became too much to handle.\r\nHowever, fortunately, we\u2019ve only lost our current night-shift and were able to dispose of every single faulty duck before they managed to ship. But in an equal stroke of bad luck, it seems a pet mouse which formerly belonged to the now passed employee. \u2018Douglas mckentail\u2019 Has gained greater sentience, and has stated malevolent intent, copying our \u2018Ditsy Ducks\u2019. After which the little bugger escaped. We can\u2019t determine the source, but new faulty ducks keep on appearing on the conveyor belt anyways. The factory should be shut down until they are dealt with.\r\nFollowing transcript describes the final solution to be accepted.\r\nThe factory is to be kept running. Further loss of personnel is acceptable, the possibility of more information about the incident leaking out, and lower profits is not. Expensive automation is to be installed immediately in order to operate with as small of a staff as possible to minimize further risks. Machines lack souls, they can\u2019t seem to tell the difference between an evil duck, and a normal one anyways.\r\nA point system is to be instigated. We cannot risk shipping too many bad ones, there\u2019s only so much tragedy that can be covered up. If an employee misses too many ducks, they are to be terminated immediately.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/845219b5426a8316490130966375c5a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VKChiuselli", "elrick", "Ketraiski", "doodlefunction"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
