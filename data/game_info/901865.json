{"id": 901865, "slug": "deep-sea-marlowebber", "name": "DEEP SEA (marlowebber)", "name_original": "DEEP SEA (marlowebber)", "description": "<p>Neural-network animals live in a 2D world with simple physics. They fight each other for the chance to reproduce. Within the first few seconds, they evolve strategies to move around, and pursue each other into deadly combat.</p>\n<p>Although simple, this game elegantly displays the mechanisms by which complexity evolves in nature.</p>\n<p>Creatures are pitted directly against each other so that the success of one depends on the downfall of another, leading to creatures constantly having to refine and improve their own ability. </p>\n<p>Compared to other evolution simulation games, DEEP SEA utilizes just enough physical simulation to make interesting forms, but is optimized for very fast performance to allow thousands of creatures at once and to have a very large map area.</p>\n<p>HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>\n<p>The animals are made of segments which join together. Segments are physically modeled as a plane moving through a fluid.\u00a0 Brains of up to 200 neurons control the angles of the segments which allow the creatures to move. <br/>Different kinds of segments can sense information from the world or be used as weapons, which trigger a fight when they touch. In a fight, the loser dies and the winner reproduces. There is a defensive counterpart for each weapon, leading to an arms race of ever-growing complexity. </p>\n<p>HOW DO YOU PLAY IT?<br/></p>\n<p>Just spawn a few fish in the same place and watch them go. After a while, they'll be cool different fish. Start over when you get bored.<br/><br/>INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS<br/>On linux, right click on the application and select 'properties', then go to the 'permissions' tab. Make sure you have checked 'Allow executing file as program'.<br/>DEEP SEA relies on SDL2 and OpenGL. You may need to install these components before you can play it.<br/></p>\n<p>WHAT PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED?</p>\n<p>\u00a0Linux is available now. Windows coming soon.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T06:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672c2c9003c010ee0286cd6810e54dab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["marlowebber"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
