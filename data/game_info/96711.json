{"id": 96711, "slug": "pseuthe", "name": "Pseuthe", "name_original": "Pseuthe", "description": "<p> Pseuthe (pronounced 'soothe') is an abstract audio / visual experience, with casual game play elements.</p><p>Take on the role of a proterozoic plankton with the sole aim of survival - absorb and consume the healthy microbes whilst avoiding those detrimental to your health. If you don't eat you will slowly starve to death, and colliding with obstacles will also reduce your health. The game ends once you fade out of existence. There are four kinds of microbes to look out for. The most common are either green or red. Green microbes give you health when eaten, red will take some away. Red microbes are sick and dying, and will fade away slowly. There are also blue 'viral' microbes which are less common, but will give you a significant health boost. Very rarely you will also see something akin to a jelly fish. These fade rapidly, but eating one gives you full health, so eat it quick! Microbes don't like to group. Striking red plankton to help them die sooner will promote the arrival of new microbes - but don't accidentally swallow anything nasty...</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>The player can be controlled with either the keyboard or a controller.<br/>Pseuthe is tested mainly with an xbox 360 controller, but others should<br/>work fine too. There are two sets of controls available; Arcade - which<br/>is enabled by default, and Classic - which can be enabled via the check<br/>box on the main menu.</p><p>In Arcade mode left and right rotates the player's head, while forward <br/>and backward accelerate and decelerate in the direction the player is <br/>facing. This is similar to many top down racing games - the main <br/>difference being that there is no friction applied to the player. Once<br/>you accelerate up to speed you no longer need to keep accelerating. <br/>Light adjustments using the accelerate and decelerate keys is the <br/>recommended approach. In Arcade mode the controls are mapped like so:</p><p><em>Accelerate:</em><br/>W or Up Arrow on the keyboard, or Button 0 or z-axis negative on a<br/>controller. This is the equivalent to the A button and right trigger on an<br/>xbox 360 controller.</p><p><em>Decelerate:</em><br/>S or Down Arrow on the keyboard, or Button 1 or z-axis positive on a<br/>controller. This is equivalent to the B button or left trigger on an xbox<br/>360 controller.</p><p><em>Turning:</em><br/>Steering is mapped to the A and D keys or Left Arrow and Right Arrow on the<br/>keyboard. On a controller you can use the analogue stick or the D-Pad to<br/>steer.</p><p>Classic mode allows you to control the player in a more realistic, <br/>physically based sense, but can be much harder to grasp. Using the WASD or<br/>Arrow keys on the keyboard or the analogue stick on the controller, you <br/>apply a literal force in the direction of the control. Pressing up will<br/>push the player toward the top of the screen, down moves towards the bottom,<br/>and so on. If you have used RCS systems in games such as Kerbal Space Program then the concept should be familiar. Unfortunately keyboard controls in this mode are limited to eight degrees of movement and so classic mode works much better with an analogue controller. The Classic control scheme has been included for those who are looking for an increased challenge from the game.</p><p>Changelog 1.0.3</p><ul><li>Made help menu more informative (hopefully!)</li><li>Updated Credits</li><li>Added Colourblind mode</li><li>Fixed score continuing to increase when window lost focus</li></ul><p>Thanks to Jonny P for the mac port!</p><p><strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>At the very least pseuthe requires:<br/><em>2.4GHz Dual core processor or higher<br/>2GB RAM<br/>ATI Radeon 3000 series or higher, or nVidia equivalent</em></p><p><em>Windows Vista or newer</em><br/></p><p>OR</p><p><em>64 bit distro of linux (ubuntu, arch etc)</em></p><p>OR</p><p><em>Mac OS X 10.10.4 or higher</em><br/></p><p>NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS<br/>Some users may recieve an error 'missing msvcr120.dll'.
