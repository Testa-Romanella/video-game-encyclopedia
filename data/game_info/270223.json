However, their worlds evolved in a questionable way. The God of Death wanted to destroy the worlds and start over but the Goddess of Life believed there was hope of all of their worlds. So they created a powerful stone called the \"Rock of Punishment\". If that rock is being used for evil purpuses, the world will be destroyed. It\u00b4s your duty to return that rock to it\u00b4s temple and keep it save from greedy beings.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In your adventure, you will meet several types of friends and enemies.</p>\n\n\n<p>Technical notes: The \"save and load\" system is not complete. So it won\u00b4t save your upgraded health and shoot rate and\u00a0 will lock the levels you have passed if you play an early level (let me know if you would like this last thing as a feature). You may also have to reset the game whenever you use the \"Delete progress\" button.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Additional assets:</p>\n<p>-Japanese voices: Cross Phase Inc.</p>\n<p>-Soundtrack: GT-K music</p>\n<p>-Sound FX: Dusty room, freesounds.org</p>\n\n<p>Have Fun and let me know if you find any bugs.</p>\n<p>DenomRS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23ebed1bf1088d0140e203ab97a974d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Denomrs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
