ALSO THAT GIF IS WAY TOO FAST</em></strong></p>\n<p>The controls are the main mechanic of the game;</p>\n<p>You can move left or right with the arrow keys. Pressing <em>Z/X</em> will make Swashbucko jump to the left/right and also enter a fencing stance. While in this stance you can continue jumping with <em>Z/X</em>, jump upwards with <em>arrow key up</em> or press <em>arrow key down</em> to duck - which also exits the fencing stance. If you remain in the fencing stance<em> without</em> doing anything you'll attack after a brief delay.</p>\n\n<p>All the hazards Swashbucko must overcome are displayed as icons along a line at the top of the screen and are spawned by a marker, moving from left to right.\u00a0 While this alerts you to when things will happen , there's till some randomness to throw you off balance. You must destroy all skeletons (meaning you'll have to wait untill they have all spawned) before you can exit on the right edge of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>This is intended as a small project so the game part will remain much as is. What remains will mostly consist of finishing the \"art\" assets, animations and various UI stuff. I will also add some more screens but I'll try to keep the game short.</p>\n\n<p>Made with Clickteam's Fusion 2.5</p>\n\n<p>And thanks for visiting this page -\u00a0 all critiques/suggestion/thoughts etc. are of course\u00a0welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33ad85c736d17f7c22bf5b5b9bfcb77a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kjetterkvist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
