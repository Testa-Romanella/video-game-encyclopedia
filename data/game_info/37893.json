In Venture Arctic, the player controls the forces of earth, sun, wind, and water to bring summer and winter to polar bears, orcas, and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Venture Arctic is an ecosystem simulator with a twist: the player is rewarded for both life and death. For every animal that passes on, the player collects a \u201cspirit\u201d, which they can then use to bring change to the environment. Players might spend this spirit to create winds, blowing the smells of a beached whale to a starving wolverine, or they might blanket the tundra in snow and ice to weed out the weak musk ox from the strong.<br/><br/><br/>While the controls are simple, the systems are complex: players must understand the mating behaviors of the caribou, the feeding patterns of Arctic cod, and the social structures of Arctic wolves in order to succeed. Most of all, players will learn that an ecosystem\u2019s survival depends upon seasons of plenty and of hardship, of life and of death.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac5707c84e343795263e83eb42d557b7.jpg", "website": "http://pocketwatchgames.com/?page_id=21", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pocketwatch Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pocketwatch Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
