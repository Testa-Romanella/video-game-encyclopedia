It tells a story from a very deep sea. It's a large story with epic proportions and mysterious mystic symbols. In this game the player follows the story of two main characters, Arrieli and Suzana. They were both born already in the deep world, they never got the chance to see how it is like to live on the surface, in fact there's a whole civilization living in the deep world and it has been like that for centuries, it's even hard for most people to believe that there is such a thing as a world over the water. However, something changed. Forever the deep world has been surrounded by a deep and persistent black background. There was no notion of \u201cabove ''. It was always incredibly dark all over, but one day the whole sea became brighter and the light was stronger the more you moved up. At this moment everyone in the deep world decided to start moving, but not necessarily up. There are many groups of people who have no interest in what is happening above and there are also some groups of people who want everyone to stay in the deep sea. There was a big conflict of ideas, people that were in power wished to maintain the status quo. There was even an imminent war between some of the states which started to explode exactly when the storyline of Arrieli and Suzana begins in the game.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game is being solo developed by Maemi Oliveira<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Maemi_no_yume<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T14:37:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb0fc527679e5f0651106a474c605c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maemi no Yume"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
