Develop the skills to survive and elude <strong>tens of guards</strong> all the while unarmed! Run, crouch, and hide to make your way through the tough and <strong>obstacle filled level</strong> without dying.</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Mouse -&gt; Look</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D -&gt; <strong>Walk </strong>Around</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D + <strong>Left Control</strong> -&gt; Jog, then after 2 seconds Sprint</p>\n<p>Space Bar -&gt; Jump</p>\n<p>Hold Left Shift -&gt; <strong>Crouch</strong><br/></p>\n<p>C -&gt; <strong>Toggles </strong><strong>Crouch </strong>On/Off</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>I made this game in 30 hours, using\u00a0Unreal Engine and its blueprint system.\u00a0My main focus of this project was to learn how to add more controls to the character (e.g. crouching and running) and how to set\u00a0up guard AI to shoot at the player; I\u00a0didn't want to just take these off of the marketplace, I wanted to learn how to do it myself.</p>\n<p>Some specific things I learned:\u00a0I learned about animation blueprints, how to coordinate between the guard's BP and its anim BP,\u00a0 blend spaces, and assigning animations to skeletons. I lightly covered branch trees, black boards, and tasks when tackling the guard's AI. I learned how to add a health bar to the HUD, and more generally how to communicate between blueprints.</p>\n<p>Most of the assets/objects are pre-made by Unreal, while the rest I got for free from Unreal's marketplace:</p>\n<p>Crouch/Jogging -&gt;\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/28fc3cc4332541e3b0037d67a...</p>\n<p>Character Holding Rifle, Idle + Shooting Animations -&gt;\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/animation-starter-pack</p>\n<p>Rifle Skeleton/Animations -&gt; https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/low-poly-shooter-pack-fre...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T02:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6b/b6bde1d148978aa68d033e7590d32861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Katelynn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
