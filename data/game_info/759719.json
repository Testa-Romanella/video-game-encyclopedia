{"id": 759719, "slug": "tone-tris", "name": "Tone-tris", "name_original": "Tone-tris", "description": "<p>My first *mostly* functioning game. This is essentially a Tetris clone. Each given piece is entirely randomized, and displayed in a 'next' window before being given to the player on the grid. \u00a0Levels are increased each time the player clears ten lines. I followed a tutorial from The Weekly Coder to put the initial basis of the code together, before adding several features independently.</p>\n<p>The game also\u00a0features a High Score Leaderboard for competitive replay value, a ghost brick to display the eventual landing location and orientation of the currently enabled piece, the ability to save falling pieces to swap back to for a strategic advantage, and a win screen if you're able to reach Level 13.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The soundtrack is provided through several artists who offered their music via free legal download sources. I do not claim any ownership of audio featured in this game. A future version to come will include credits to these artists, as well as photographic credits. Please forgive the delay in such an addition.</p>\n<p>CURRENTLY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</p>\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<p>- Swapping pieces is occasionally prevented, stopping the player from swapping their current piece despite not having swapped it yet.</p>\n<p>- MacOS\u00a0build not fully functional</p>\n\n<p>I will be continuing to update this game in an effort to fix the above problems, as well optimize graphics and UI. Be sure to check back for future versions to come!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T12:33:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57a/57a2020a0a6aebd255a618d29e30c752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Meter Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
