The simulation actually determines the creatures in the game: their bodies, how they swim, and how they think and behave. All the creatures in the trailer evolved on their own in the game; none were hand-edited!<br/></p>\r\nVirtual creatures evolve on their own to adapt to an environment you create\r\n<p>At Ecosystem's heart are evolving virtual lifeforms, who grow from synthetic DNA and live in a physically-simulated ocean. This synthetic DNA encodes everything about a creature, from skeletal structure to skin, from joint-types to mental processes. The genetic code of a creature can mutate, combine, be spliced with other species, and be directly modified by the player.</p>\r\nCreatures' nervous systems evolve along with their bodies\r\n<p>Creature brains are also encoded in DNA and subject to evolution. The neurology of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs is passed through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part.</p>Movement is bound by the laws of fishics\r\n<p>To swim, creatures don't just play an animation. They move like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward. Working within this physical simulation, evolution can produce an enormous variety of body shapes and swimming styles.</p>Play for thousands of hours and never see the same animal twice!\r\n<p>A wide variety of different creature populations share a single environment, where they swim, graze, prey on each other, and have children. The fittest creatures pass their genes along to their children, and over time a world of strange and unique creatures is born...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1bb482c477b56b0ae26ad1cbb43b9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slug Disco"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
