The rest of humanity, numbering very few, has retreated into the mountains of Slovakia, seemingly safe to live out the rest of their lives. However, a strong winter has slowly encroached and chances of survival seem much slimmer.<br/></p>\n<p>Split into five equal factions, each player takes control of one and must gather\u00a0 resources, trade with others, craft materials to help provide shelter. Your overall goal: survive sixty days until the end of winter. It is not that simple, however. Everything happens in this world for a reason; connecting with the same spirits to which ushered the apocalypse can hint to a more horrific fate than what was once understood.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T11:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78b5461eb6bc9a7087f6709bdc51dde6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thom_jake-theOnlyJake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
