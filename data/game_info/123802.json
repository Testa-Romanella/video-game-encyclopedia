I am thinking most of the player activity will be resource gathering (for fuel, food and energy), but at this point all the doors are open: who knows what cool stuff we will be able to do one day?</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in this prototype you can:<br/>- Accelerate and rotate your ship with arrow keys<br/>- Lose fuel<br/>- Cause minimal damage to your ship<br/>- Use a tractor beam to capture people<br/>- \"Land\"<br/>- Deploy your pilot on the ground and walk</p>\n<p>Looking forward to feedback and ideas!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbf07bcad18101af584c43819ad9951e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erick Bonatelli"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
