An alpha version of the game was completed in 1992. The game was submitted to a game competition run by Boeder &amp; 64'er magazine and was selected as a winner! The prize included a publishing contract for the game. Sadly, this was not to be as Boeder ceased publishing for the C64 soon after.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In 2001, the game code was resurrected and in 2005 a release was planned by Protovision. The release didn't happen at the time as more work was required to bug-fix &amp; fine-tune the game. Thanks to the hard work of the ever-expanding Outrage team, the extra work required to complete the game was carried out in 2018 &amp; 2019.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And now, in 2020, Protovision &amp; Psytronik\u00a0are pleased to present beautifully packaged versions of the game for the C64\u00a0(A more detailed history of the game is available\u00a0HERE)!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>5 levels fully packed with finest arcade action (Hawkeye style)</li><li>Each level with a monstrous end boss</li><li>A shop to buy ammunition, smartbombs and more</li><li>Colorful graphics, animations and special effects</li><li>Beautifully crafted SID in-game music and sfx </li><li>Title picture by STE'86 (Steve Day)</li><li>PAL and NTSC compatible</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f0761e0e2ea642b7ab04b94fae13e35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Protovision"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
