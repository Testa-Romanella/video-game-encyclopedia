Well, in this case, we will be rocketing hot dogs at people's pie holes and trying to push 50mph in an oversized food truck down a super busy street.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to drive the truck and left mouse click to shoot hot dogs. Get to the finish before the timer runs out, but make sure to hit enough people with hot dogs in their face to rack up major points! Also, try not to hit (or be hit) by any of those crazy drivers; that will definitely lower your score.</p>\n<p>FINAL THOUGHTS: The original scope was to also use the mouse to maneuver a food truck worker inside the truck the make orders to shoot, i.e. hot dogs with ketchup or mustard or relish. The people would have specific orders that would bank more points if hit. Obviously didn't get that far! I'm also planning on adding some graphical enhancements after I submit, for my own sake. I'm going to spice up the colors of the cars and people, and create some background art for the buildings. I'd also like to compose a little piece of music to use, as well as add some sound effects!</p>\n<p>ENJOY!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc4aee1c910e0a39756b52d6ccf5521.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["midnighttangentstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
