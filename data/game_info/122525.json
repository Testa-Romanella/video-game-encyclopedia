It aims to nail the aesthetic of early morning, roughly 7AM, using bright and orange colours to put you in that mental timestate so you really feel like this is really <em>you</em> preparing for the day. That game offers a sweet nostalgic feeling by letting the player complete their morning tasks step-by-step, like taking a shower or making some coffee. <em>Good Morning</em> wants you feel like you're in <em>your</em> home doing <em>your </em>thing.</p><p><strong>Credits - </strong><br/></p><p>Jacob Blanch - Designer</p><p>Levi Stenton - Designer</p><p>Alex Luthe - Programmer</p><p>Tye Bryant - Programmer</p><p>All models have been sourced from <br/>http://www.sweethome3d.com/freeModels.jsp<br/>and all credit goes to the according creators<br/></p><p>All audio has been sourced from <br/>http://freesound.org/<br/>and all credit goes to the according creators</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b3aaf0b1fd6983defd77e8b1e933f30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Levi Stenton"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
