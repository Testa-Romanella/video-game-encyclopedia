{"id": 481330, "slug": "ocean-oi", "name": "Ocean OI", "name_original": "Ocean OI", "description": "<p><em>Ocean OI</em> is an experimental series of combat encounters in RPG Maker 2000's native turn-based battle system, exploring MP management as a central feature of strategy and party dynamics. Here are some of the things I'm trying:</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>13 challenging </strong><strong>battles with minimal framing narrative.\u00a0</strong><em>Ocean OI</em> takes a brief tour through its\u00a0mechanics and wraps\u00a0up before exhausting their possibilities. The gauntlet has been carefully curated for depth, rhythm, and drama.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Well defined, interdependent character roles.</strong>\u00a0The \"Conduit\" class nourishes the party with MP (called\u00a0<em>numen</em>), but every party member has their own job to do managing supply and demand in the numen economy. Who's got it? Who needs it? Who must go without?</p>\n<p>- <strong>Simple enemies, elaborate encounters.\u00a0</strong>Each monster has a role to play in its own party, they've been arranged to support each other and to press\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0in diverse and interesting ways. An enemy you write off in one battle might become the\u00a0most urgent threat when it gets the right support.</p>\n<p><strong>- All the charm of being lost at sea in the moonlight.<em>\u00a0</em></strong>Despite my minimalist intentions, I got distracted tinkering with polish. Enjoy the mood lighting! If the low contrast is too low, please leave a comment and I'll take another stab at it.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Estimated play time: 90+ minutes.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\nSpace/ZConfirmEscape/XCancelF4Toggle windowed/fullscreen (windowed mode recommended)F5Toggle resolution\r\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\r\nGame designSra\u00ebka-LillianTestingJohn Thyer, NARF, S.K.Special thanksDylan Gauche, Marina Ayano Kittaka, Tian Jiang, and the VEXTRO communityArt &amp; music assetsRPGMaker 2000 RTP", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d79b06ffcfdf6ba22e8ff0b155581db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sra\u00ebka-lillian"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
