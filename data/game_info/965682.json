In this experience you will walk the environment in first person listening to a narrative that is triggered in certain areas.  It is less a game and more a short narrative artwork.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n     A group of children are brought by a singularity AI to their new home in an abandoned subdivision. This story follows two of the girls, Flutter and Juniper, who explore the houses during a winter storm, interpreting what they find within.  This is a immersive short story (one hour) that is part two of a trilogy.  Part one is seen through a machinima video.
