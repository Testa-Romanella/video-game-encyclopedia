But what if they\u2019re robots from a place called the Institute of Perfection? <br/>\r\nIn UglyDolls: An Imperfect Adventure, a whole horde of robots are on the loose and taking over Uglyville trying to make it \u201cperfect!\u201d. What is wrong with that, you might ask? Uglyville is a sweet neighbourhood where everything is a little off. The townsfolk are all uniquely different and embrace each other for their differences.<br/>\r\nOn the plus side, you get to be Moxy, the energetic UglyDoll who\u2019s got a lot of \u201cmoxy\u201d! You prefer Ox? That\u2019s ok, pick him instead and play as the founder and mayor of Uglyville. As one of these characters, you\u2019re about to team up with all your friends from the UglyDolls movie, explore the adorable quirkiness of Uglyville, and work together to send those uptight robots back to where they came from. <br/>\r\nThis robot invasion is sounding more and more like a party. And we haven\u2019t even mentioned how you\u2019ll meet lots more UglyDolls, interact with them, and collect or craft useful things that will help you capture and return the robots to their home. You will encounter things like pogo sticks and hover hats. You\u2019ve never owned a hover hat before? Then your UglyDoll friends really hope you come on this robot party adventure. But do you have the courage not to run away from the pesky robots? No? Don\u2019t worry. Moxy (or Ox) will run away with you or help you craft the \u201cperfect\u201d item to transport them home. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tCONTROL MOXY OR OX and team up with fellow UglyDolls: Babo, Ice Bat, Wage and Ugly Dog<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tEXPLORE UGLYVILLE with procedurally generated streets that make every game different<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tLURE AND TRAP a horde of relentless robots and send them out of Uglyville!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tPLAY TOGETHER in 2-player local cooperative mode", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f33/f330ab5379ac5f18e8165aece71fd6cf.jpg", "website": "https://www.outrightgames.com/uglydolls", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 90, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Well Played"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Outright Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
