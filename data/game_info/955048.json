Abrams</strong>\u00a0[M] the last surviving descendant of gregory abrams, so-called prophet and founder of the abrams family, a nomadic vampire-hunting cult that was massacred almost two decades ago. once a prolific vampire hunter, wyatt used to strike fear into the hearts of many, but nowadays without his family to back him he\u2019s more washed up than anything. liar, thief and con-artist, wyatt has taught you--his adoptive child--everything he knows about hunting\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>swindling.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>.Doctor Cyrus Sokolov</strong>\u00a0[M] [RO] larkin\u2019s local doctor and head mortician, though in larkin he seems to get more work out of the latter of those titles than the former. quasi-mayor of the small town, he operates as the apparent patriarch of the blossoming sokolov empire. he\u2019s more than a little suspicious larkin\u2019s newest preacher, but then again, is he really wrong to be?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dominic Sokolov</strong>\u00a0[M] [RO] the youngest scion of the sokolov family, dominic works as assistant mortician in larkin, though he\u2019s much more interested in larkin\u2019s living townsfolk then the dead ones he\u2019s been charged with taking care of. with seemingly endless information on everyone and everything that goes on in larkin, mister sokolov might not be the worst friend to have.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Celina Sokolova</strong>\u00a0[F] [RO] despite the misconceptions among the townsfolk, the reclusive third sibling of the sokolov family, celina, is actually the family\u2019s eldest. hardly leaving the sokolov mansion, it\u2019s rumored around town that she\u2019s been struck with some sort of sun-related illness, others seem to hold the opinion that miss sokolova simply sees herself as too good to linger amongst the common folk. whatever the case may truly be doesn\u2019t much matter to the people of larkin, after all, it's much more fun to gossip.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Nash</strong>\u00a0[M] [RO] larkin\u2019s only practicing attorney and resident do-gooder. after passing the bar exam, nash headed out west in the hopes of making a real difference for the people there, only to spend most of his days settling petty disputes and notarizing documents. despite his disappointment, however, nash has managed to keep a level head\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>his fondness for the people of larkin, even though he\u2019s not so sure the sokolovs have the townsfolk\u2019s best interest in mind.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Rose Holloway</strong>\u00a0[F] [RO] larkin\u2019s most recent transplant, that was, until the preacher showed up. former city-girl, rose has adapted to both life out west\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>on her own, the only way she knows how--by pushing through it. owner and bartender of larkin\u2019s only saloon, the emerald, rose is a popular figure around larkin whether she likes it or not, but whether that has more to do with her occupation or the fact she also happens to be larkin\u2019s youngest widow is still a topic up for debate.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Ace\u2019 Zhang</strong>\u00a0[M/F/NB] [RO] vampire-hunting-mercenary extraordinaire, the last the preacher knew of ace, they were the young hot-shot on san francisco\u2019s hunting scene. once upon a time ace was a prominent figure in the preacher\u2019s life, the first real acquaintance they managed to make on their own, someone outside of wyatt\u2019s sphere. growing up a member of the guild, their life is one that\u2019s mirrored the preacher\u2019s. maybe that\u2019s why the two seemed to be linked so closely during the preacher\u2019s time in california, whether that was as friends, rivals or something more.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hollis</strong>\u00a0[M/F/NB] [RO] an enigmatic figure around larkin, hollis serves as a lieutenant for the children of cain. one of the cult\u2019s few members to make the long trek from their encampment in the desert to town more than once. talked to by few, hated by most, hollis bears the reputation of the people they represent to the town of larkin--one, that isn\u2019t particularly favorable.\r\n</p>\n<p>----\u00a0</p><p>game blog!</p><p>patreon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated":
