It's just another space shooter. Maybe a bit high definition for '97 technology, but otherwise it's fairly standard. Right? Surely nothing bad will happen.<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the game to a 'complete' state, but I'm submitting what I've done, anyway. The time I didn't spend on figuring out shaders, I wasted on learning Blender. The good thing is that I am getting better with both Unity and Blender, though I'm still very much an amateur.\u00a0</p><p>Please ignore any texture seams - I'm still trying to figure out how to hide them.</p>\n<p>The 'folk horror' aspect would have been clearer if I'd gotten more done, but the emphasis on exploration and atmosphere would still be the main focus. Thought I'd do a sci-fi blend to spice things up a bit, as most of these submissions seem to be set in the woods or some creepy mansion.</p>\n<p>Tested on Windows x64.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/525c357a36c06ae32a4233ceffb71930.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearhunter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
