Some<br/><br/>Gnomes departed for human cities, intermingling with the other races.\"<br/>Characteristics of the Gnomes:<br/>They are skilled magicians. But they are not very resistant and have little strength. They are also used quite a bit in semi-magical classes, such as bard, druid, or cleric, because of their high evasion and mana.<br/><br/>Lessons<br/>Classes determine what each character excels at in the game. There are two families of classes, the so-called combat classes and the secondary classes. The former, as their name suggests, specialize in fighting other players, non-player characters, or hostile creatures. The others are the players who create most of the items used by all players in the game (food, clothing, weapons, and decorations). Therefore, both types of players are necessary for the internal economy of the virtual world of AO. When starting the game and creating a new character, the player chooses the class to which he wants to belong based on his preferences and game expectations. Players who prefer faster and more dynamic gameplay tend to prefer combat classes, while those who prefer a more complex experience rich in interactions and trades tend to choose one of the so-called secondary classes.<br/><br/>Available classes:<br/><br/>Wizard<br/>It is the class that is dedicated exclusively to the use of magic, they have a phenomenal amount of Mana (which allows them to cast a large number of spells), an acceptable magic attack but they have low life points and poor agility.<br/><br/>Cleric<br/>A class that has its fair share of magic and physical attack, combining them can be quite effective, but it doesn't excel at anything special.<br/><br/>Bard<br/>Class with good magic attack, good magic defense, and good agility. It has acceptable life and intermediate mana (depends on the race).<br/><br/>Killer<br/>Expert class in the use of the Stab skill, with a good physical attack but little mana.<br/><br/>Druid<br/>Expert class in the use of the Tame skill, good magic attack and magic defense. Acceptable health and intermediate amount of mana.<br/><br/>Bandit<br/>Class with good physical attack, specializes in hidden movement and critical attacks.<br/><br/>Paladin<br/>Expert class in using weapons and armor, they have a very good physical attack, but little mana.<br/><br/>Thief<br/>Expert class in the Pickpocket skill, can move hidden and immobilize their opponents with pickpocket glove equipped.<br/><br/>Warrior<br/>Expert class in the use of weapons and in the use of ranged weapons.<br/><br/>Pirate<br/>Expert class in the use of boats, can slash from a distance.<br/><br/>Employee<br/>Expert class in Carpentry, Blacksmithing, Mining, Fishing, and Logging (varies in some other games; may include Tailoring).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T05:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11c/11c2f7beaf0dd02f58ca87fe4b779211.jpg", "website": "https://argentum-online.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["https://argentum-online.org/", "Nosetu.com"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["https://argentum-online.org/", "Nosetu.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
