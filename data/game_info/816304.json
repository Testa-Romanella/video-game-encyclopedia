The first of two eventual installments for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, it was developed by Ukiyotei, and published by SNK on May 27th, 1999. It works similarly to the traditional Metal Slug games, although has toned down graphics and changed controls to fare with the Neo Geo Pocket Color. There are over seventeen missions to complete, which offer bonuses (e.g. characters) and alternate endings, although not all of these must be cleared in order to finish the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-13T20:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/210a4c8a2897beeb3b51f0c28b590bcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Neo Geo"], "developers": ["Ukiyotei"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["SNK"], "esrb_rating": null}
