This game was made as part of the Bevy Jam 3. Click here for the GitHub source.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Survive through the phases shown in the top bar to win. <br/><br/>The size of your green base and purple towers indicates their health. <strong>Don't let the base die! </strong>The more health your base has at the end, the higher your score will be. <br/></p>\n<p>There are two phases indicated by the bar at the top:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Build phase </strong>(green): Click with the mouse to build towers. They'll damage all the surrounding enemies, but be careful they also damage your towers and your base.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Heal phase </strong>(red): Click on your towers or bases to heal them. Caution: each time you heal you trigger a new wave of enemies!</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Thanks to the Bevy engine for this delightful jam.
