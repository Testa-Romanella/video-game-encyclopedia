We listened to everything card gamers desperately want, that AAA is not providing, and built it into an experience that will be unparalleled. <br/><br/>Set in a grim Lovecraftian theme, Dark Table brings a unique strategic experience with up to 4 players battling in a free-for-all, using temporary alliances and mutual interest to get ahead. Select your leader and build your deck around it to survive the onslaught and claim your world.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/><strong>-Online 4-Player- </strong><br/><br/>One of the features that sets Dark Table apart from other digital CCG\u2019s is the ability to play with up to 4 players in a Free-For-All. Most digital CCGs are 1v1 and boring. The 4-player concept brings so much more fun and chaos to the game, allowing for very unique strategies, and giving casual players a better chance at winning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game\u2019s alliance system allows players to make a temporary alliance with others in order to stop the largest threat on the table. This acts as a balancing measure when some players have better cards, but can also be a bluffing tactic to get an advantage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>-Unrivaled Deckbuilding-</strong><br/><br/>One annoyance of other digital CCG\u2019s is the reliance on packs, loot boxes, or endless grinding to build the deck you want. Dark Table CCG takes a different approach; all cards can be bought with in-game currency, paid currency, or deck tokens so you can focus on the fun of deck-building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hope is that deck-building will be similar to real-life CCG\u2019s and less like a gambling experience that makes you sink a ton of money before you can play the cards you want. At any time you can build a deck using a deck token, no matter the value of the individual cards, so you can spend your time theory-crafting and playing decks and not stressing about cost. <br/><br/><br/><strong>-Skeleton Key-</strong><br/><br/>There is also an incredible option to buy the Skeleton Key, an in-game item that unlocks all the cards in the game for you, including future sets. Never worry about buying cards again, and focus more on collecting art, unlockables, and achievements. The Skeleton Key grants 4x of each card in all current and future sets, these are added to the cards you earn in-game or ones you have already purchased.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dark Table CCG is meant to be more like a physical CCG, both in how cards are purchased and the level of customization you have. Because we have no loot boxes or packs, you get cards by earning them or buying them as a main method of funding the game. The cards you own have a quantity that are tied to the decks you make. So to build more decks you must either break apart ones you own, or earn/buy more cards. The Skeleton Key is a way to ensure you can always build at least 2 decks with all cards in existence. This way, you can focus on earning the in-game unlockables for customization.<br/><br/><br/><strong>-Customization-</strong><br/><br/>Most card game players IRL like to have a certain level of customizability to their cards and board to show off to other players. They usually like to buy colored or themed sleeves for cards, unique dice, and playmats with artwork on them for their board. Other digital CCGs have failed in this area, and Dark Table CCG intends to deliver.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Dark Table CCG you can customize almost everything. For your player presence you can change your Avatar and Title through achievements you earn. You can change the Card Back, Card Border, and Leader Border as you earn them in progression. You can also earn Playmats that come in the form of 3D terrains. They will start basic, but have upgradable mods to make them more animated and interactive, sometimes coming with their own music.<br/>A big custom option will be Alternate Art for cards. Alternate Arts will be bought with gems in-game and change the portrait art on a given card. This will support the artists that make them and also have the unique effect of altering the aesthetic ability effects for that card (as seen with the Apprentice of Old above).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T03:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa4a0c9b4d78459d1d309c13c3f7d7ba.jpg", "website": "http://darktableccg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doonamai"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Doonamai"], "esrb_rating": null}
