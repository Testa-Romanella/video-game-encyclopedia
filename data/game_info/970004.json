{"id": 970004, "slug": "apocalypse-survivor-2", "name": "Apocalypse Survivor", "name_original": "Apocalypse Survivor", "description": "<strong>Apocalypse Survivor (Beta)</strong> is a challenging first-person shooter (FPS), set after a nuclear war. <br/><br/>You battle the militia that has taken over what is left of a region of the Mojave. Escape the prison camp, and find your way to a hidden bunker that leads to safety. Get information from a few holdouts along the way, but beware of some rather unsavory mutations that have occurred after the initial fallout.<br/><br/>This is a mini-game with only one load screen, so it should be pretty fun to play. It was made with the GameGuru Engine, and uses some customized characters, and many assets from their own collection. It ended up looking pretty cool, so we decided to share it with the world. All music, animation, and graphics were created in house. <br/><br/>This game is being released in Beta, until about 30 days from release, at which time I will release an update.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T23:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb97d3777b119cb1abfff487337f0c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlayPath Experiences"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayPath experiences"], "esrb_rating": null}
