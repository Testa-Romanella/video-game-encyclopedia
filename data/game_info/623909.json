You must use this feature to complete puzzles. If you need to restart press escape, wasd to move, or you can use a controller. It works for windows.</p>\n<p>This is currently a prototype for some game mechanics, so if you have trouble understanding what to do for the first puzzle or something isn't clear please check out the video explaining how to beat the puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you for some reason like the idea or game mechanics and would like to see this become something more than a piece of garbage then tell me. Otherwise, it's just gonna sit here, not doing anything.
