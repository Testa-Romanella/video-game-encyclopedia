Watch out, you'll lose speed over time! But don't worry, your fans are patiently waiting for a selfie with their favorite celebrity vlogger, and they'll give you a neat speed bonus if you interact with them!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls - PC <br/>Left Mouse Click: Jump <br/>Right Mouse Click: Slide <br/>Left Mouse Click: Interact with fan <br/>Controls - Mobile <br/>Swipe Up: Jump <br/>Swipe Down: Slide <br/>Tap: Interact with fan</p>\n<p>Game Artists:<br/>Cynthia Fujii<br/>Mariana Tavares<br/>Kevin Lima (Tech Artist)<br/><br/>Game Designers:<br/>Lucas Renan<br/>Thuany Guimar\u00e3es<br/>Pedro Wolter</p><p>Game Developers:<br/>Jos\u00e9 Gabriel</p><p>Sound Designers:<br/>Gabriel Barbosa<br/><br/>QA:<br/>Christine Simas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236dc87728a44e87639ccf2f8f1131db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Grandez", "jgquirino", "LucasRenan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
