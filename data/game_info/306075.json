Tennis Tune-Up incorporates real world physics so that ball action and reaction is as good as it gets.  Your voice commands take you to the action. In Tennis Tune-Up you \"say what you see\" to take control of the action.  The Command Board in each scene gives you the voice commands to use.  <br/><br/>The action starts in the Club House where you can view the video tutorial and then continue off to the stadium to practice.  <br/><br/>In the stadium you can have coach drop balls for you to hit at the targets or you can have the balls hit from across the court for rally practice.  Move the targets in, earn points and develop your game. With \"Practice Serve\" you develop your ball placement in the forehand or backhand courts.  Pick  up points by bringing in targets and firing away! <br/> <br/>There are many improvements and features in the future of Tennis Tune-Up that we are planning:<br/><ul><li>The addition of a two handed serve with one controller holding the racket and the other used to toss the ball.  When you choose this option in the Club House you will test your play area to make sure you have enough head room.  If you pass the test you'll go off to the Stadium for two handed serves.<br/><br/></li><li>Support the Vive Tracker Racket that HTC has available.  You'll  have the same Club House height check when you choose this option. <br/><br/></li><li>A custom racket. We  plan to have the custom racket available for  purchase at a price less than the cost of a Vive Tracker.<br/><br/></li><li>Take your action to the park in our City Park scene that is planned to be available soon.<br/><br/></li><li>We are planning so that you'll be able to move around the court to practice your shots from various places on the court in the Court Practice scene.<br/><br/></li><li>We plan the final addition  to be your being able to take on players of different levels of skill in the Match Play Arena scene.</li></ul><br/>To  enable Speech Recognition on Windows 10:<br/>    Open Control Panel.<br/>    Click on Ease of Access.<br/>    Click on Speech Recognition.<br/>    Click the Start Speech Recognition link.<br/>    In the \"Set up Speech Recognition\" page, click Next.<br/>    Select the type of microphone you'll be using. ...<br/>    Click Next.<br/>    Click Next again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e69774ce178c5cc60c1e422b0f0ae0ed.jpg", "website": "https://butterscotch-vr.com/tennis-tune-up", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kenneth Pestka"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["ButterScotch"], "esrb_rating": null}
