There are three levels which allow the user to vary the concentration of reactants and products, temperature, and the pressure. The rate of reaction is indicated by the sound of the various particles colliding. There are four study screens which explain the various reaction mechanisms that could take place. This program is not a strict mathematical model and cannot be used to calculi Keq\u2019a or actual reaction rates. It is meant to give the user a simple visualization of the relationships of the variables.</p>\n<p>Download the zip file and extract. Run the setup program.
