Mr. B is kidnapping old people and turning them into hot dogs! It&#39;s up to you and your best buddies to save the day. You&#39;ll leap, slash, and blast your way through increasingly madcap levels filled with traps, weird and wild enemies, treasure, and more. Along the way, you&#39;ll help a whale regain confidence, take a side in the battle between toast and dinosaur, travel to a legendary sunken city and decide the fate of a Pirate election. Explore the world on the back of your giraffe. Your travels take you across a huge land filled with zombie pirate cats, post-apocalyptic dinosaurs and hotdogs that poop explosive mines. Explore the mystical forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city of Crablantis.<br />\nInspired by classic platformers and cartoons alike, The Adventure Pals combines hilarious characters with rip-roaring platforming and combat. Level up to learn special abilities, throw bombs and whack things with your sword. Find cupcakes to unlock costumes and fill your scrap book up with secret stickers. The game is a mixture of lovingly handcrafted platformer levels, combat focused arenas and RPG-like locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies for you to buy to aid you on your journey. Just like your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The Adventure pals is both nutty and sweet,with perhaps just a little crunch. It is lighthearted, goofy fun no matter what your age.<br />\nGame FeaturesExplore five distinct worlds, all with their own unique characters and quests.<br />\nLevel up by defeating baddies to improve your health, stabbin&#39;, or rock-smashin&#39;.<br />\nGameplay that&#39;s easy to pick up, but ramps up the challenge as you go.<br />\nA fun and funny story with a bizarre but lovable cast and hilarious cartoon cutscenes.<br />\nBattle such dazzling, creative bosses as vegetables, breakfast, a tree, and more!<br />\nPlay by yourself, or with a bestie in co-op mode.<br />\nThree words: Giraffe. Helicopter. Tongue.<br />\nThe Pals<br />\nThe Player<br />\nThis is you! One minute it\u2019s your birthday, the next your Papa is being stolen from you right before your eyes! Thrust into the role of adventurer, when all you\u2019d rather be doing is opening presents, you quickly realise that you are a natural at this baddie-bashing, grapple-swinging, toaster-popping, quest-completing, experience-leveling, treasure-seeking malarky. But will you be able to rescue your Papa and stop Mr B\u2019s diabolical plans in time?<br />\nSparkles The Giraffe<br />\nFriend. Philosopher. MENSA member. Giraffe. Sparkles has many talents beyond being a mere mount. Use her not-at-all-creepy helicopter-like tongue to slow and direct your fall, or her long neck to yank yourself to distant enemies for devastating combo finishers, or up to those hard-to-reach platforms to y\u2019know... jump higher<br />\nMr. Rock<br />\nWhen you need somebody sturdy you can lean on for support, call Mr. Rock, because, well... he&#39;s a literal rock. Maybe he&#39;s a bit of a smart-aleck, but don&#39;t take him for granite... you\u2019ll discover he has some pretty awesome abilities to unlock as you adventure through the game</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-13T13:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc5a4ff92f7621cd1e844b6a42a20310.jpg", "website": "http://www.theadventurepals.com", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 102, "owned": 925, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 18, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 122, "ratings_count": 42, "suggestions_count": 367, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 43, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Armor Games", "Massive Monster"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Armor Games", "Armor Games Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
