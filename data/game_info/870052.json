You swear when you look out your door that the entire world is drenched in darkness. All you can see is an empty vacuum of space from which anything could emerge. How can it even be that dark? Was it usually that dark? It couldn't be. The same two people keep trying to get candy from you, but you don't even think it is Halloween yet. Weird things just seem to be happening, but hey, it's not all bad. You've got this sweet potion clicker game on your computer to pass the time, so that's cool.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\r\nControl<br/>KeyboardControllerChange LocationDown, S<br/>D-Pad Down<br/>Open / Close Door<br/>EnterA or Cross<br/>Click on a Potion<br/>EB or Circle<br/>Pause / Restart<br/>SpaceY or Triangle<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Originally, the potion clicker was supposed to be something else. I wanted each monster to have their own creepy pasta-like article which you could scroll through, and I wanted the article displayed on the computer to be relevant to the next monster which would appear at the door. You would read about the monster, and then, it would emerge out of the darkness, but I hit a roadblock with a few hours to go. The result was that I scrapped that idea for the computer and replaced it with a simple clicker mini-game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a02c366ac775cf498da2dd6ced6177ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Emma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
