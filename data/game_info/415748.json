Originally I was going to export this to HTML5, but I\u00a0ran into a bug where none of the polygons with Skeleton2D's attached would be visible, and thus I was unable to make it functional at all on that platform.<br/><br/>If you defeat the final \"boss\"\u00a0root, the color and rain will be restored to the world. This was originally going to be much more granular, but I ran out of time. You also will be able to fly around the level at will like Flappy Bird to more easily go back and see the true colors of the earlier platforms.<br/><br/>Source is extremely messy and probably not very educational...
