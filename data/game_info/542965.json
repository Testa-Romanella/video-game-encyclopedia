{"id": 542965, "slug": "penguin-panic-groonygruze234", "name": "Penguin Panic (GroonyGruze234)", "name_original": "Penguin Panic (GroonyGruze234)", "description": "<p>Penguin Panic is a game made for the Kindred Community Game Jam #5.<br/></p><p>NOTE: Due to a mistake on my part, the application will be titled \"Blizzard\" instead of \"Penguin Panic\" when downloaded.</p>\n<p>The themes were \"Penguin\u00a0party\"/\"The fire mustn't go out\", so I decided to have some fun and try to fit both!</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to survive three minutes without either running out of health of letting your fire go out. Enemy penguins will try to throw snowballs at you to hurt you, or touch your fire to damage it. You can kill them by throwing your own snowballs back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some enemies can drop potions, which heal you or your fire (or both!), or powerups that improve your firepower.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and the Left Mouse Button to shoot.</p>\n<p>I plan on releasing later versions once the jam is over adding new enemies, powerups, etc. if enough people want it. No guarantees, though.</p>\n<p>I'm fairly new to gamedev, so feedback and suggestions are welcome!</p>\n<p>P. S. Watch out for the boss penguin near the end!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Design: Me</p>\n<p>Programming: Me</p>\n<p>Art: Me</p>\n<p>Music: Me</p>\n<p>SFX: Me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T04:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b9ed5ffb9f6f6152c9887499edd44d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GroonyGruze234"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
