It's about circulation and passing through. You have to keep it alive. You have to maintain it to keep its value. You have a very good maintainer, your brain. It does big amount of work in controlling your inner organs. How long could you stay alive if you take the its job?</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>There are four stats (blood circulation, oxygen, water and nutrition). Your goal is to keep them above 0%.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood circulation</strong>\u00a0is maintained by the heart. Press\u00a0<strong>F</strong>\u00a0key repeatedly to make the heart beating. Be careful to not beat too quickly.<br/></p>\n<p>Level of\u00a0<strong>oxygen</strong>\u00a0is maintained by breathing.\u00a0\u00a0Inhale by holding\u00a0<strong>J</strong>\u00a0key, exhale\u00a0when you release it. The more deeper breath you take the more oxygen is absorbed.</p>\n<p>When the\u00a0<strong>water</strong>\u00a0level decreases below 80%, the body will drink - the stomach fills with a water (but only if it\u2019s empty). To absorb the water, use the stomach, by pressing\u00a0<strong>K</strong>\u00a0key.<br/></p>\n<p>The most complex process is to obtain\u00a0<strong>nutrition</strong>. You have to wait for the body to eat (nutrition level is below 80%). By pressing the\u00a0<strong>K</strong>\u00a0key, the stomach will digest the food. Digestive process has multiple phases. First the stomach has to fill with gastric acid, next it must churn multiple times until the food is fully digested.</p>\n\n<p>Nutrition from digested food is absorbed mainly by using small intestine (pressing\u00a0<strong>D</strong>\u00a0key). This will create some amount of waste material in large intestine.</p>\n\n<p>Large instestine is controlled by\u00a0<strong>S</strong>\u00a0key to move the waste material throuh it and absort remaining nutrition (smalled amount then small intestine).</p>\r\nWhat is updated?\r\n<p>Smashing all the buttons randomly won't keep you alive. You must keep the frequency of heart beats in certain limits and use deeper breaths using lungs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/3176021c10f2a5c9ea1988a58c78b2b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["uiii"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
