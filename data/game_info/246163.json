{"id": 246163, "slug": "hyper-pixel-ten-thousand", "name": "Hyper Pixel Ten Thousand", "name_original": "Hyper Pixel Ten Thousand", "description": "<p>Hyper Pixel Ten Thousand is a Metroidvania-style platformer for desktop Web browsers. At the start of the game, you control a yellow pixel that can simply move left, move right, and jump. Soon, you'll find your way to a weapon, and then a double jump, and then a speed boost, and so on. The game is relatively short, but challenging, replayable, and much more complex than the first few rooms suggest. If you would prefer not to play in the browser, a downloadable Windows port is also available.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b6bc92d9382fb51d0d695765c82e65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["hyperpixel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
