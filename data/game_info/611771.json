And behold, we\u2019ve made it \u2013 the newest match 3 legend!<br/><br/>Join us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/3tiles_game/<br/>Join us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/3Tiles.game<br/><br/>3 Tiles is one of the newest free match 3 games. Most board games are suitable for casual entertaining, while memory match games help to relax after stressful studying and working hours. In matching games, you need to connect 3 similar tiles with vivid pictures, for instance, avocados, guitars, ice cream, sausages, and many other tiles with interesting items. Match triple items of the same type to pass the current level! <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY A TILE MATCHING GAME? <br/><br/>Matching puzzle games can be tricky, but all tile games have some common connect game mechanics. After all, you still need to connect blocks with pictures, right? Most free match games have the same rules as free tile games. And here\u2019s ours.<br/><br/>- Well, you should match 3 tiles! Match triple tiles to put them into the stack. Three similar tiles will be matched and removed from your tile stack. <br/><br/>- When the playing field is cleared, you win! Continue your tile match practice to become a real match master one day! <br/><br/>- You fail, if you don't get at least one merge for 7 tiles in your stack. Keep this reminder from our match masters: you have a maximum of seven moves to make one tile match. Each match block matters!<br/><br/>- If you want to get a high score in memory match games, you should merge those tiles faster to activate the score multiplier. <br/><br/>3 TILES KEY FEATURES:  <br/><br/>Every tile-matching game has unique game features and 3 Tiles is no exception! Let\u2019s make the tile connect process fun again! So, what\u2019s on the menu?<br/><br/>- No 3d match involved. Some games force players to match triple 3d tiles, and that can be really annoying, especially with those \u201cflipping tiles\u201d mechanics, that prevent you from seeing the picture on every tile. No need to match triple 3d objects here, everything is in the player\u2019s sight!<br/><br/>- Each match block selection has a completely unique distribution on the board that surprises with variety - you have an extremely diverse gaming flow for each new level! The tile spread changes on every level, so you won\u2019t get any \u201cordinary\u201d tile connect pattern.<br/><br/>- You can play as you like! Whether it\u2019s a fast-paced combo-rush or a meditative and thoughtful approach, you\u2019ll find exactly what you want in 3 Tiles. This game suits all game styles! <br/><br/>- Offline availability. No need to worry about those matching puzzle games that require constant Internet or Wi-Fi connection \u2013 you can play in offline mode whenever you want it!<br/><br/>- Free matching games classics. 3 Tiles is the matching game for adults and the matching game for kids at the same time! The simple match block rules and relaxing gameplay mean that anyone can enjoy a round of 3 Tiles. <br/><br/>Let\u2019s play!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T04:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b8/1b84fa1b276636b51b9aa86a806468c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["LiftApp"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
