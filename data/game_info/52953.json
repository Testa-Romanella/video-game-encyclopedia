Unlike later games in the series, this game's cover has no specific driver on it (except for the North American version which features an image of Michael Schumacher driving for the Benetton team during the latter portion of the 1991 Formula One season).</p>\n<p>Published by Psygnosis, Formula 1 is based on the 1995 Formula One season. The game was released in North America, Europe and Japan (for PlayStation only) in 1996. It is distinct from its sequels because it was made after the end of the season, meaning that it features driver substitutes. The game also allows two-players to compete against each other either head-to-head or with other computer cars via the PlayStation Link Cable. Both players may then compete over a 17-race Championship season, or in a single race of the players choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/37329db7c72a74cce0db42d94d6dd2fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Bizarre Creations"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "esrb_rating": null}
