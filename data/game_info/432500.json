You\u2019ll climb through dark tunnels to reach mystical mountain temples. You\u2019ll match wits with goblins, ghosts and sentient coffeemakers. You might even save the world from tearing itself apart.</p>\n<p>All you need to get this quest started? A magical phone. Be sure to read the fine print.</p>\n<p>This is Guildlings, a new story-driven episodic adventure brought to you by Asher Vollmer (maker of Threes), IGF award-winner Jamie Antonisse, and the team of dedicated indies at Sirvo Studios. Drawing inspiration from classic RPGs, point and click puzzlers and visual novel games, it tells a lighthearted coming-of-age fantasy tale within a modern mobile frame.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Traverse hand-crafted low-poly environments, including floating ruins, a tavern built from a shipwrecked boat, and the mountaintop teen hangout known as \u201cMakeout Temple\u201d.</p>\n<p>Use a text-message inspired chat system to make conversations and choices. Characters will react to your decisions in satisfying (and sometimes hilarious) ways.</p>\n<p>Leverage your Guild members\u2019 abilities in playful turn-based combat. Each Guildling has a unique set of powers tied to their personality.</p>\n<p>Affect the world around you through your Guildmaster magic. A single touch can unlock doors, open treasure chests, or even blow up your dad\u2019s favorite lamp.</p>\n<p>Guildlings\u2019 magic powers are tied to their moods. This system ties conversation, exploration and combat together. Keeping your team happy will make your journey easier, but sometimes a little drama will take the story to interesting places\u2026</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve read this far already, what are you waiting for? Boot up your Tome, meet your new best friends, and become their Guildmaster. Worldaria awaits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-22T16:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12e2ca93213f4805aee74d4ec2289a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sirvo Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sirvo Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
