You are a snake, trapped a long ago in a temple (because you never stop growing, so yeah, trap the damn thing on a temple so it doesn't mess up the world). Your goal is to escape the temple by clearing out puzzles and avoiding hitting yourself, or walls, or both. <br/> <br/>The themes we selected were Growing, and Two Buttons. <br/> <br/>We used Beargine by Mock, developed on top of SDL2 and C++11. <br/>The Web Version was built using Emscripten. Still a bit raw, some graphic bugs <br/>may happen. Also the same for an android port. <br/> <br/>Bugs: Head may split from body on WEB version. <br/> <br/> <br/>Programming: <br/> <br/>Foxtacy <br/>Mock <br/> <br/>Artists: <br/>Raf <br/>Guax <br/> <br/>Music and Sound: <br/>Arlam Jr. (https://www.facebook.com/arlamjr) <br/> <br/>Game soundtrack: <br/>https://soundcloud.com/arlamjr/sets/snakescape-soundtrack <br/> <br/>Original team: https://www.facebook.com/hungrybeargames/ <br/> <br/> <br/>*easter egg when finishing the game*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff38405b2de1993eaa2619366956c5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HungryBear"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
