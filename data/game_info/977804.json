You can wrestle with rabbits and bop bunnies when you get a friend to play with. With just two controllers you can experience a charming and expressive indie fighting game in full color. Inspired by other classic 2D fighters \"Tiff and Tussle\" aims to be an adventure into what makes those games great with a fresh coat of pixels. We literally rewrote the graphics buffer just to put this game on your screen. Some people say \"How do you get the game to be so good?\" and the answer is that it is just so good and that is the answer. In fact this is the game that makes a person go out and eat five pounds of hay early in the morning before the sun comes up then wonder why they ever leave their burrow in the first place. According to recent studies and statistical analysis of the gaming habits of early mammals, rodents are ten times less unlikely to not consider picking up a controller and playing this game. Further statistics have shown and even proven that those who read this sentence do in fact think about what it would be like to purchase this video game or in-fact wishlist it.<br/>\r\nCloud Saves and Steam Achievements are planned. Online multiplayer planned in a future update. CPU controlled training opponents are also planned.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T12:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d641c785ea327b34f2ba8e6cfe2b6e4.jpg", "website": "https://cankerheart.dev/Tiff_and_Tussle/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avery T."], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cankerheart"], "esrb_rating": null}
