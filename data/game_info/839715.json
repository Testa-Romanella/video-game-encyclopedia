Is this thing on?</p>\n<p>Oh good. Hello. As Teal Hill Zone Campsite Coordinator, it's my job to update you with what you need to know.\u00a0Purely on a need-to-know basis of course.</p>\n<p>A truck carrying radioactive waste has crashed near the Teal Hill Zone Campsite, and everyone has mutated into horrible Monsters! Everyone that is, except you!</p>\n<p>You've developed Psychic powers from exposure to the toxic waste, and now it's your duty as Camp Officer to clean up the campsite!</p>\n<p>Harness powerful weapons such as guns, and more guns, and even more guns. Oh,\u00a0and saw blades!</p>\n<p>Monsters drop Bits when defeated, collect enough, and the research team at Teal Hills Zone Campsite will upgrade your equipment and give you cool new abilities! Why do we have a research team?\u00a0 Because there's research to do!</p>\n<p>Be careful, it looks like Monsters get stronger the longer they're exposed to the waste, so keep your wits about you, collect Bits, and survive!</p>\n\r\nUpgrades\r\nBlue\r\n<p>These upgrades benefit your main gun.\u00a0That's the one you point and shoot with.</p>\r\nYellow\r\n<p>Yellow Bits can be traded in for sentry guns and their upgrades! These bad boys orbit around you firing at any Monster nearby. Or anything really. They just fire.</p>\r\nRed\r\n<p>We found these saw blades with faces on them, and we figured you could trade your Red Bits in for these and\u00a0use your Psychic abilities to form a shield. The lab boys think they might be sentient, and if so, they seem to be pretty shy, so you might need to coax them out. But when they're out, oh boy...</p>\r\nPurple\r\n<p>Now listen closely. Purple Bits have the closest DNA to humans than any other Bit. Yes, Bits have DNA, don't question it. Anyway, use these Purple Bits to get upgrades for you.\u00a0Yes, YOU! You deserve it!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the WASD keys to move around, and aim with the Mouse Cursor. I don't know what that means, but the lab boys tell me it makes sense. Your gun will auto fire for you, no more carpal tunnel syndrome!</p>\n\r\nNote\r\n<p>We've got some readings from the lab saying, hold on... \"Due to the nature of the radioactive material outside Teal Hill Zone Campsite, reality itself has began to corrupt\".\u00a0 Sounds like scaremongering to me, I wouldn't worry about it. But if you do notice 'reality itself corrupting', don't panic. I imagine this would include:</p>\n<ul><li>Starting a second run doesn't work.
