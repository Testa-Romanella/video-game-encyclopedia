I had this idea to make a rogue-lite game in Bitsy and just ran with it to see what I can do. Hope you'll enjoy this short experience!</p>\n<p>P.S.: as of now the game has no win state, you just go as far as you could until your character runs out of guts or until the game runs out of rooms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:46:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/201/20149fa24783ea2e6ebe46636ce068ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Valeriy Petrov"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
