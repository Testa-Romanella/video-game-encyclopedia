Help him to get home by solving the puzzles! You must remove all cubes by moving the matching ones close to each other. When all cubes are gone the exit opens and Cubenic can go on!</p><p>Just like Cubenic himself each cube can be shifted left and right: place the mouse cursor on it, hold the left mouse button, shift the cursor somewhere and release the mouse button. Different to the cubes Cubenic can jump over a single sized gap and can also mount a single sized step.</p><p>Cubes vanish if they collide with other cubes of the same type (i. e. the same color / symbol). When the exit is open Cubenic must enter it to fly to the next level - or maybe to freedom?</p><p>Note: if there is only one cube of a type left, then it cannot get matched with another one. Then the level must be restarted. Also if a cube lands on Cubenic\u00b4s head the level gets restarted, because he dies. Finally, if on the one hand all cubes were matched but on the other hand Cubenic cannot reach the exit anymore then that is a dead end and the level must be restarted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b496511ce47052b76ef33ed7e793a841.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jireugi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
