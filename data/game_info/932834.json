On the Nokia, you had to press the 2-button three times to get the letter C, or press the 7-button once to get the letter P.</p>\n<p>To make it more natural (and authentic) for those born before the 2000's, the letters are placed on the same physical places as on the Nokia. Example:\u00a0The top right button\u00a0(number 9 on the keyboard numpad) gives you D, E, and F\u00a0. The bottom left gives you P, Q, R, and S. The middle button gives you J,\u00a0K, and L.</p>\n<p>The game can be played both on the keypad and normal numbers on the keyboard, but using the keypad is HIGHLY recommended.</p>\n<p>Please leave a comment with your thoughts!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T05:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13fb4e92980bf39a57d984fa698a4dd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WaffleVictor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
