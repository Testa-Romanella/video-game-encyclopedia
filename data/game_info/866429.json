Everything is connected via a conscious intelligence that runs the universe.  It's about dropping the ego - the idea of being a person itself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is political, religious, and other unsavory topics too.  The writing is not typical.  There are functionally no characters in this story.  You'll probably laugh at some point but the novel is mostly serious in tone.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n\u2022 20-30 min maximum reading time<br/>\r\n\u2022 Absolutely no choices to be made<br/>\r\n\u2022 16 Drawings made using vectors<br/>\r\n\u2022 Gummy Worms", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T04:30:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11fe231b88c7fa8fbda0b3b43a59a91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cleril Calamity Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cleril Calamity Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
