Blade &amp; Sorcery is a medieval fantasy sandbox like no other, focusing on melee, ranged and magic combat that fully utilizes a unique and realistic physics driven interaction and combat system.<br />\nBuilt exclusively for VR, collisions are dictated by fine hitboxes, objects have weight and follow the laws of physics, creatures have full body physics and presence, and blades can be used to penetrate soft materials or deflect magic.<br />\nIn Blade &amp; Sorcery, the combat is limited only by your own creativity. Choose your weapon, choose your stance, choose your fighting style; Be the powerful warrior, ranger or sorcerer you always dreamed of becoming!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-31T20:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcfe07a966c8e59ee32022e9ccb72304.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 472, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 24, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WarpFrog"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WarpFrog"], "esrb_rating": null}
