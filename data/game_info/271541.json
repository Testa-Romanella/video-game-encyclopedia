They have razed cities, sacked farmlands and murdered countless people in their demented bloodlust. The town of Ostbury, sitting on the edge of the Shadowfen, has so far been spared their wrath. But as the approaching army makes its way east, it won't remain that way for long. <br/></p>\n\n<p>A mysterious well with strange magical properties has appeared in the village, causing the population to spawn Sorcerer Babies. They have no choice but to use them to fight the goblin horde.</p>\n<p>Inspired by:\u00a0http://baby-elimination-rate.tumblr.com/post/139317691904/the-heroes-of-our-tale<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c798cf947bc3cdd5d06b4387762b7dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gee It Some Laldy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
