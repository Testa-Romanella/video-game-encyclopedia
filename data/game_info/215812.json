With your trusty laser gun, these foes are destined for destruction, even if it takes a few tries to get there!</p>\n<p>The Sockster - This strange tentacled alien needs a wake up call! His excessive laziness is creating a productivity black hole, transforming all the residents of the galaxy into lame lazy butts. He represents a threat to society, and it's your job to eliminate it!</p>\n<p>The Doggo Roboto - This innocent dog becomes less so when he gets in his mech suit! Who gave it to him? Why does he wear it? These questions may never be answered, but what\u00a0<em>is</em> known is that it causes a lot of collateral damage. This poor pupper represents a threat to society, and it's your job to eliminate it!</p>\n<p>Scarlet - Ack! A Space Soviet Seductress Spy!? She may have a simple mind, but her simple calling is to tear down the tenets of capitalism across the galaxy! This sultry saboteur represents a threat to society, and it's your job to eliminate it!</p>\n<p>Bad Frog - Cover your ears! This fool of a frog thinks he's all that, but, in reality, he's the worst DJ in the galaxy! His awful mixes bring nothing but pain and suffering to those who listen, it's fortunate that your noise-cancelling helmet can play some better music while you're in game! Nevertheless, he represents a threat to society, and it's your job to eliminate it!</p>\n<p>This is my second boss rush game, a sort of spiritual successor to the first, Kuri, which I made my senior year of high school for my game development class (and is also available to play for free\u00a0at funndev.itch.io/kuri!)\u00a0This game was\u00a0made for my first game development class in college over the span of just over three and a half months, this time with a partner to help with design and implement many of the attacks.\u00a0While being a follow up to Kuri, it also took inspiration from <em>The\u00a0</em><em>Binding of Isaac</em> and\u00a0some of the boss battles from\u00a0<em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. It was quite the enjoyable process, and I feel like I learned a lot about working with others and managing a good production schedule.</p>\n<p>Design/Programming by: Adam Eckert, Luke Shaffer</p>\n<p>Art by: Adam Eckert</p>\n<p>Music/SFX by: Layne Wixom (and a little bit by Adam Eckert)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/697/69762136c83ac1d744d3e91a8400a414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FunnDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
