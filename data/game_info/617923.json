There is no way you can possibly win... unless you use your awesome telekinesis abilities and fling around a boulder to knock out your opponents!</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move yourself. Your boulder will follow you around as if tied to you by a string, and you can spin the boulder around yourself by pressing A and D. Killing enemies will make you regain health. See how long you can survive the endless onslaught of enemies!<br/></p>\n<p>All coding was done by me (Jazu Mikeru) and my friend (Penguinatortis), and it was the first time coding an actual game for both of us. I think we did a decent job, and please give us feedback in the comments! We will try to update this game somewhat regularly to make it better and better. Music (wip, not added yet) was done by my other friend Crazexpert.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing, I really appreciate any feedback you give us.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:34:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f0509fc98dd4579cc7fd6db2ba2ae11a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jazu Mikeru"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
