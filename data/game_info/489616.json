With our engines overloading, we made one last emergency hypserspace jump to this asteroid field where some friendly miners have responded to our distress call. Our sensors detect the enemy is still searching for us.</p>\n<p>Use your miners to gather resources from asteroids and build ships to defend yourself from the incoming enemy fleets. Destroying enemy ships will give you upgrade points to repair the War Machine and improve your ships. Use your upgrade points to repair the hyperdrive to escape the asteroid field and win the game. Enemies will come from the closest corner of the map to the War Machine.</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Try to get to your miner limit as soon as possible, this starts at 20 and can go up to\u00a035</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>B:\u00a0Open/close ship production.</li><li>U:\u00a0Open/close upgrades.</li><li>Tab:\u00a0Open/close help.</li><li>WASD/Arrows:\u00a0Move the camera.</li><li>Spacebar:\u00a0Focus camera on War Machine.</li><li>Left mouse button:\u00a0Click or drag to select ships.</li><li>Right mouse button:\u00a0Command selected ships.</li><li>Mouse wheel:\u00a0Zoom in/out.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>A huge thank you to Tom who helped me fix so many bugs and balance issues and helped make the game actually fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets bought/used from the following places:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>My friend Tom who made some awesome resource icons for me</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-space-kit-27662</li><li>https://wenrexa.itch.io/nesia04<ul><li>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li><li>https://www.youtube.com/royaltyfreezone<ul><li>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul></li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f9dedc026a934f39f12b06004efbb18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["pandepic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
