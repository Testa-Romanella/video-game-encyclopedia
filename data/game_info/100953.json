(open the link in your favorite browser)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis game is a first person shooter, and is very fun.It has two game modes - Single Player Zombies and Multiplayer free for all. In Multiplayer, you have three classes to choose from - Sniper, Juggernaut, and a good old AK-47.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Zombies, you have access to a variety of weapons, and there are three kinds of zombies. There are the default zombies - nothing too special about them, the invisible zombies - the are the same as default but they have a hazy smoke texture instead of skin, and a boss. Bosses are incredibly strong. There are 5 maps right now in multiplayer, and 1 in zombies, and a preview of them is in the games screenshots section.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne big bug is that some computers cant connect to each other, it just depends on your network or firewall, I guess. **Note** sometimes it takes up to 30 seconds to connect to a server.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSince this isfree, please help by giving a small donation with your download.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGameplay:\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Join the Discord here so it is easier to find a game:\u00a0https://discord.gg/RF3RdVt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bd25947dd48f7a0946e956aeb61d4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Unidub"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
