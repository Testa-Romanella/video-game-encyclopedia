Each owned land generates 1 gold per day.\u00a0<strong>Your goal is\u00a0to destroy all\u00a0enemy units.</strong></p>\n<p>In the game there are two kinds of key tiles. Player owned key tiles and neutral key tiles. The neutral key tiles are tiles that have not yet been claimed by a player. Neutral key tiles become part\u00a0of a player's land if it exists in a\u00a0connection between two player owned key tiles, and as a result\u00a0creates additional connections for the player while the connection exists.<br/></p>\n<p>The game can be played with 2-4 players locally. The game has an easy/normal difficulty\u00a0AI that you can play against.

Upon a new day, all units become ready, and all players gain 1 gold for each land they control.</p>\n<p>Starting turn\u00a0order changes systematically every day.
