To open the levels, you need to find 10 keys and a save disk. Our hero will be trying to kill zombies, the enemies, but going into a frontal attack is not always rational. Sometimes it's better to go in from the rear. Zombies can be very fast, and you must continually dodge them. Also, collect first-aid kits to stay alive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e6b312511d3c52ab86add57936b819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kzunec"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
