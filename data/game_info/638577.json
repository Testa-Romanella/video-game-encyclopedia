Marbles have no eyes so you won't be able to see anything on this journey \u2013 but this one at least has ears. Listen carefully to your surrounds and you'll eventually pass every obstacle and reach your destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>This game should be played with (decent) headphones!</em><br/>(And on a somewhat potent CPU.)</p>\n<p>Turn off your screen after starting the game and close your eyes for maximum immersion. You won't see any graphical output anyway.<br/><strong>Klinkulytte</strong> might require your patience, concentration and the ability to understand and interpret what you hear. You won't be taken by the hand, try to find out how to play best for yourself.</p>\n<p>Gamepad (recommended)</p>\n<ul><li><em>left stick:</em> tilting</li><li><em>right stick:</em> horizontal turning</li><li><em>LT or RT (hold):</em> listen</li><li><em>B:</em> restart level</li><li><em>D-Pad left/right:</em> previous/next HRTF</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard</p>\n<ul><li><em>W/A/S/D</em>: tilting with random imprecision</li><li><em>Arrow-Keys:</em> horizontal turning</li><li><em>Space (hold):</em> listen</li><li><em>R:</em> restart level</li><li><em>O/P:</em> previous/next HRTF</li></ul>\n<p>The game includes all 20 Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) from the SADIE II database and Steam Audio's default HRTF. You might want to select one that leads to the most natural spatial localization.<br/>The \"light\" version (unpacked around 109 MiB vs 313 MiB) of the game comes with only the D1 HRTF. Additionally, you could simply override a HRTF (inside Klinkulytte_Data\\StreamingAssets\\) with your own preference (note the file format info).</p>\n<p><strong>Call for music:</strong><br/>The expedient music currently used is a bit of a placeholder.
