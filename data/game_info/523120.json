DvG is an imaginative twist on the classic story of David versus Goliath. In this epic virtual reality game, YOU are the young shepherd boy on a journey to protect your sheep from the dangers of the outside world. You better be quick on your feet because there are lions and wolves and bears nearby! Armed with a simple yet powerful sling, you\u2019ll face challenges around every corner. They are sneaking through green pastures, lurking in the woods, and prowling in caves. If you defeat these foes, then you just might find yourself on the battlefield in the Valley of Ellah. There Goliath has threatened to destroy your family, lands, and nation. IF you can beat him in one-on-one combat, you will save them all. Can you sling your way to victory? Are you a \"mere\" shepherd boy, or are you a GIANT SLAYER? DvG is brought to you by VLB in collaboration with  Virtuous VR Gaming and Immersive History.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T03:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebef26d03fcb245a91dcd784d5aa3077.jpg", "website": "https://DvGtheGame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Immersive History", "immersivehistory.com"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Virtuous VR Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
