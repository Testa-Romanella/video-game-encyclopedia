Meet Sticky the stickman. Sticky is an idiot. He can\u00b4t do maths, he cant cook, he even can\u00b4t jump! Can you survive the hand drawn levels?\u00a0Are you stick enough for reaching the green flag?\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your answer is no, a stickman dies - and you don\u00b4t want a stickman to die, do you? So bring your stick in position, spit in your hands and start collecting those green flags, because Sticky loves green flags!
