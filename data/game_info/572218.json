Inspired by Portal, Quake, and Half-Life, in On Your Hands you think fast - or die faster.<br/><br/><br/><strong>THE STORY SO FAR </strong><br/><br/>Deep in the metal halls of the Wonder Facility, Aliens are coming through to Earth in a slipgate that can only be closed from one side - the side it opened on. Your mission is to journey through Ooblterra, the alien planet, and close the portal. Grabbing your flashlight, you steel your resolve and jump into a wormhole of your own; and are flung in front of a strange Cathedral. Your journey begins here.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Master of Magic </strong><br/><br/>On Your Hands contains seven unique magical abilities, each of which aid in solving puzzles or fighting enemies. Some magical abilities are upgradable, unlocking new powers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Creature Feature </strong><br/><br/>Deadly monsters such as the<strong> Lurker, Grinder,</strong> or <strong>Concealer</strong> seek to stop your journey - cower in fear, or use them to your advantage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Unravel The Mystery </strong><br/><br/>There is a single sign of human life in Ooblterra - strange tape recorders, which make reference to a man named <strong>Prot</strong>. Careful secret hunting is the key to finding the truth of the story they tell.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Alien Architect </strong><br/><br/>On Your Hands will receive a free update post-launch to include a level editor, to allow player to express their creativity using the game\u2019s mechanics.
