Your goal is to survive for as long as possible and make a dam to <strong>delay the inevitable</strong>\u00a0flood. You control the ball with W, A, S, D. Due to you being a ball it makes for some different movement controls. To build the dam you need trees and to get them, you roll into the tree at high speeds. The player pushes the trees to the dam to make it larger. The flood destroys one piece of wood at a time. The flood gets stronger and stronger making it <strong>inevitably</strong> too hard to keep the dam going.</p>\r\nThis is a combination of the following themes (we wanted to keep some ideas from them)\r\n<p><strong>Delay the inevitable</strong> - The flood</p>\n<p><strong>One tool may purpose</strong> - You are the tool (both movement and getting wood)</p>\n<p><strong>Single resource</strong> - Wood</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73fa19f64a87eb78e0a2a0deddcf7b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["IldenH", "LilleAila"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
