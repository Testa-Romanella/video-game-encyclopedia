A lot of very sparkly puddles.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You decide that to get home you might as well take full advantage of these puddles. After all, it's only ever so often that you get to play in puddles.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>On your way home you may notice some items that catch your eye. A shiny apple here or a colorful leaf here. You collect these items as you slide on your way home. As you make your way home, you may even notice that the more fun you have with it, the less dreary it seems to be outside. Infact, you may even see how magical your surroundings truly are.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Once you\u2019ve landed in a puddle, you can use the water on your shoes to try to slide to the next nearest puddle.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Collect lit up items to increase your speed and unlock obstacles in order to get home.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc16f3d79fcff53fb422b6ce2b4d931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CardOfPage"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
