Each time you make a successful dice, you will earn score. If you make a failure, then good luck with your life.<br/></p>\n<p>But!</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, there are certain dices that the factory want to make. If you particularly make the targeted dice at the moment, you will gain your life back (and more score)! Yey!</p>\n<p>What? There is no challenge?</p>\n<p><strong>Behold! The Roll Bar!</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the progress of Roll Bar ended, the whole factory will go berserk (Error 404) and the dices platform will re-roll! You have to pay attention which path goes to which and survive as long as you can!</p>\n<p>You may be a lucky person, where all the dices go to their correct destination. Or you may be an unlucky person, where all the dices are just playing around with you. In summary, this is a game of focus and stamina. Hold as long as you can and gain the highest score that nobody can achieve!</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Developer: Namekian [Initial: JA]</p>\n<p>Project of GMTK Game Jam 2022: Roll of the Dice</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Good Luck and Have Fun Everyone!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:57:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7f10fe198fd47dbb57ec0073165b5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Namekian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
