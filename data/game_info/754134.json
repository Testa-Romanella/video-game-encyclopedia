Oh right and if you want to be serious about learning Daoism you should do it by yourself and don't base it off of a touhou fangame.\"</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>RPG Maker MZ plugins by Moghunter (@moghunter1)</p><p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/dvxz33CQhU</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/85554108e3b27e16af0bf5371c34b5c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tamarisk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
