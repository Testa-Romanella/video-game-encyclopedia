It works like a game of tag but instead of passing the tag on, it just spreads to more players until there is only one untagged player then they win.</p>\n<p>I developed this prototype mainly to evaluate and learn Unity's DOTS packages (Entities, Physics, Netcode).</p>\n<p>Please note that no matchmaking service has been integrated yet and whilst players can connect to others that are hosting there is no NAT-punchthrough or relay servers so ports will have to be correctly forwarded on the host or a virutal LAN service will need to be used.</p><p>Also note you can create your own server to play in by selecting host and then click the spawn character button in the top right to create your player.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><p>wasd - run direction<br/>space - jump<br/>control - duck<br/>control + duck while still - backflip<br/>control + duck while moving - long jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4e90af15c263639b81343e376db6419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Egan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
