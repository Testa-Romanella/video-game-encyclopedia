Horror games are fairly easy to solo and get the right feel. Horror games are about scaring the character, and if you can scare the player as well, that is a bonus.\r\n</p>\n<p>Comedy games are about making the player laugh. You are often doing terrible things to the characters, but in a way that is supposedly comic. When you are both Ghostmaster and player, making yourself laugh is not so easy.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are entirely new to solo and have come to it because you have never been able to convince your group to play a Ghostbusters International campaign, I have a special chapter for you coming right up.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are an experienced soloist, you may have struggled to mix comedy games with the standard yes-no oracle. Comedy is often about timing and flow. The yes-no oracle can be more stop-start. You ask a question, roll the dice, get the answer and then stop to consider the meaning. This can disrupt the feeling of flow.\r\n</p>\n<p>When I was developing these rules, I found to make the game play as intended, fast-flowing, comic mishaps, and improvising how my characters had to improvise clashed with the inherent stop-start of the yes-no oracle.\r\n</p><p><strong>A print version of this book is available from\u00a0Ghostmaster \u2013 PPMGames</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91f1a9f8f09c2815939fecf80be52f09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parts Per Million"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
