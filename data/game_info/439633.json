It is a meditative practice, and like all such practices the most important thing is: <strong>can you get the highest score?\r\n  </strong></em></p>\n<p>Get Your Rocks Out is a digital roll-and-write game (think Yahtzee). The aim is to make the highest scoring rock garden that you can, using that day's selection of rocks and other items. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>[In beta -- let me know if you hit problems]</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n  \r\n<p>Each turn you will be presented with two items for your garden. You must place at least one of them to continue, but you may place both if you wish. <br/></p>\n<p>Click on an item to select it. Click again to place it.<br/></p>\n<p>Not all squares in your garden will be available every turn. Those that are not available will be shown with a cross.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Each item has rules about how it should be placed in order to score well. Invalidly placed items will reduce the score. (Space, RMB or the eye icon will show a useful view of which squares are safest).<br/></p>\n<p>Once you are happy with the placement, press the green button to proceed to the next turn. You will not be able to amend the items after this point.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The small gauge between the items shows how many remain. When you're down to the final item, the pressing the button will score the game -- you don't need to place the very last item if you don't want to.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Why not post a screenshot online with the hashtag <strong>#RocksOutGame</strong>?. Not only would that be a fun way to compete with your friends, it would validate my choice not to code leaderboards of any kind in what is, essentially, a score-based game.\r\n  </em></p>\r\nItems and Placement\r\n  \r\n Big and Medium Rocks \r\n<p>To be valid, these rocks must be placed in accordance with the following rules:   </p>\n<ul><li>They must not be adjacent to other rocks; for a big rock this means within 2 squares, for a medium sized rock, 1 square.\r\n  </li><li>There must not be any other rocks in the same row or column. Note that shrubbery or lanterns negate this alignment, so rock--shrub--rock is fine (as long as the rock has enough space around it).\r\n  </li></ul>\r\n Low Rocks\r\n  \r\n<p>These function similarly to Medium rocks, except that you only need to worry about one axis re alignment with other rocks. (Horizontal for left/right rocks, vertical for up/down rocks).\r\n  </p>\r\n Small Rocks\r\n  \r\n<p>To be valid, these need to be placed with no other rocks in a 1 square radius. Extra points can be scored by positioning other items at the \"knight's move\" positions -- see the green squares.\r\n  </p>\r\n Lanterns\r\n  \r\n<p>To be valid these need to be placed with no rocks in any of the squares at the immediate north, south, east or west.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Extra points will be scored by aligning with other lanterns, horizontally or vertically -- the further apart, the better. This alignment is blocked by big or medium rocks (but not low or small)\r\n  </p>\r\n Shrubbery\r\n  \r\n<p>This can be placed anywhere, but extra points will be scored if placed next to existing shrubbery.\r\n  </p>\r\n Mystery Crate\r\n  \r\n<p>This crate could contain any of the above, but its contents will only be revealed when the turn ends. (Gameplay note: the crate's content is not completely random; placed in the same position on the same map it will give the same outcome).<br/></p>\r\n Other considerations   \r\n<ul><li><strong>The Border</strong> -- while rocks and lanterns placed on the outer edge can be valid, you will lose some points for them (shrubbery is fine). Conversely, there is a bonus for keeping the border clear.\r\n  </li><li><strong>Faultless Bonus </strong>-- if all items are placed in valid positions, you will earn an extra bonus.\r\n  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61ed52e3c6a1dc5efba111d9ed363476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cephalopodunk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
