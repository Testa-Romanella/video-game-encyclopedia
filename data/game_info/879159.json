There may be obstacles in its path, though.\u00a0The spaceship has three chances until they can reach the \"Master of the light\"</p>\n<p>The game is on Godot and on the game engine, I created the levels, experimented with the assets, found the ideal explosion effect for the player's spaceship and the enemies, made sure that the player's spaceship has a power-up, created a HUD for the player's lives and score, and created screens for the pause and end of the game. </p>\n<p>What I did to create the level in Master Light was used the tilemaps. For the\u00a0animations and effects (using the animation player) I wanted\u00a0the enemies will appear randomly and also\u00a0when the player\u00a0re-emerges after losing a life. The addition of music and sound effects was crucial because they enhance the fun of a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b93d151634bdf4b348aff3a1e34e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OnePersonStudio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
