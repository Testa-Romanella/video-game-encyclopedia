You will have to work you way through levels in under the minimum time with the help of wall-sliding, time-manipulation, a powerball attack and more. There are a wide assortment of moving platform types including ones that spin, accelerate, wobble, expand, push, orbit and more. Most levels are fairly linear while a few contain puzzle elements like collecting keys for locked doors, hitting switches to alter the behavior of something or pushing objects. An assisting camera view, if enabled, will offer helpful perspectives at times while the player has full control over a scrolling or rotation perspective also if they prefer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7f9a00db077608f3debf9ea16ff1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boothj1985"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
