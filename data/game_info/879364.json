I had hoped to include single and double doors and a little puzzle maze with a story before leading into an infinite runner style system but something took way longer than I was expecting and I can't really pinpoint any one thing. I just about managed to get the story in there, though not as elegantly as I wanted and I didn't get to add the infinite run.\u00a0I did add\u00a0an\u00a0\"ending\" to\u00a0try and\u00a0make\u00a0up for it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\nProgramming and Design\r\n<p>Derwent Ready</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>Kenney - Various Textures<br/> Derwent\r\n</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/vectors/bubble-circle-sphere-blue-shape-576578/</p>\r\nSound Effects\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/iron-door</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T14:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/43473c1b4af1331f4fbe3d5415c425f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
