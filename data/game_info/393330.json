What makes it fun is that you are not limited to the plot, and the journey you choose can take any twist you choose to embark on, while taking you to the destination that your decisions can take you to.</p>\n<p>It's quirky, it's realistic, and you have lot more choices and thus replayability and several minutes of fun. There are only a few different endings, but based on your actions they would be different.</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Tired of going to random quests to reach an executive level in a game? Tired of clicking buttons waiting for events to decide on? Tired of a game where there's nothing you can do when going against the plot?</p>\n<p>What you have here is a game that is limited only by your imagination (and of course the options I didn't write). Not only can you choose from a seemingly random set of choices, but also the story unfolds accordingly.</p>\n<p>And it's free, totally. Has 5 to 35 minutes of gameplay depending on your level of immersion.</p>\n<p>This is a game that I kind of wanted to play, and although I have played similar stuff, never found exactly the kind of quirkiness I was looking for.</p>\n<p>Many ingame aspects are just a joke so I hope you enjoy it. Also the game is more focussed on the branching of the story so only way to get around is to try out several different branches. It's the first choice based web game I ever made.</p>\n<p>I'll fix the spelling errors soon, might add more dialogue options too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3e82987618ea1681ed5a8015c364923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["literate"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
