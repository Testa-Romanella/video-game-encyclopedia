{"id": 847688, "slug": "dropwars", "name": "DROPWARS", "name_original": "DROPWARS", "description": "<p>My submission for 2022 Epic Megajam.\u00a0The game mechanic runs with the theme \"As above so below\". As what you do on the blue gameboard would send commands to the units on the battlefield. The outcome on the battlefield would in turn reflect back to the gameboard pieces. If a unit dies on the battlefield, the game piece representing it would get deleted. A factory captured would turn colours to the team that caught it. etc<br/></p>\n<p>Use the triggers to grab each of the red game pieces and let go to drop them further into enemy territory. Sometimes the grabbing could fail because of the building in the way, try grabbing the piece from another angle.<br/><br/>Once dropped on the board they will move to that location. They will shoot anyone close enough and you can see the range of soldiers' attacks when you lift them high on the board.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to capture the enemy headquarters. You have to knock out the health of the building to zero per cent and then drop a soldier on top of the building to Capture it and win the game. You can drop units on\u00a0factories to create new soldiers to aid you.<br/><br/>On hard mode, the enemy will attack you so stand your ground and wait for your moment to strike.<br/><br/></p>\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T16:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c0/3c0f574a5945e07cd7f2f66e499e1dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["RowdyWabbid"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
