They've clearly been cutting corners.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2021, Operator features too many things to do, a not in the best condition nuclear power plant, and not enough power sockets to run everything at the same time. Can you survive the 5 day internship? Probably, but you never know.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you get stuck:</strong></p>\n<p>- Note that most stuff is drag and drop, the entire game is played using mouse</p>\n<p>- Drag off the top of the screen is basically just dragging it up, and up, until something happens</p>\n<p>- Plug looking things go into the socket looking things.</p>\n<p>- If you put the card in and power is hooked up but nothing is happening, press the button.</p>\n<p>-Soft locked or cannot proceed? Press SPACE to autocomplete the level.<br/></p>\n<p>- Still stuck? Comment below and ill get back to you soon as can be.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0ac436b8965b85771c1363d83e16247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Darylsteak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
