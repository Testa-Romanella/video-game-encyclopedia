Decide which element to sabotage depending on your soldier distribution. Try to be as efficient as possible. Available sabotages are :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Poison the food pots : </strong>Soldier's that ate from the pot dies after some time.</li><li><strong>Disrupt the citizens : </strong>Reduces the spawn rate of soldiers</li><li><strong>Impair weapons : </strong>Soldier's longsword will be replaced with a broom (less damage)</li><li><strong>Spread war blessing :</strong> Generate a random boost for your hero</li><li><strong>Ruin the water well : </strong>Sabotage speed goes up by a certain percent</li></ul>\n<p>Making sure that the hero reaches safely is actually quite challenging. Consider yourself as a winner even if he dies midway. At the end of your day, you <em>succeeded</em> at defending your castle :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>But if you are\u00a0 a <strong>real gamer</strong>, you should be able to <em>progress </em>by the soldier's <em>failure</em> and sabotage your way to the <em>victory</em>. Good luck :)</p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>CONCEPT</strong>--------</p>\n<p>This is something I like to do before starting to develop a game. I always sketch out the screens that are most important to have in my mind. Then I think about what do I require, can I do it in this time slot and so on...</p>\n<p>Don't forget the power of planning :)</p>\n\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>CONTROLS\u00a0</strong>--------</p>\n<p><strong>Movement :\u00a0</strong>A W S D</p>\n<p><strong>Jump :\u00a0</strong>Spacebar<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Shift Hold\u00a0 :</strong>\u00a0Sprint</p>\n<p><strong>Interact/Sabotage\u00a0:</strong>\u00a0E (Keyboard)</p>\n<p><strong>Switch Cameras :</strong>\u00a01 (Keyboard)\u00a0 / 2(Keyboard)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Toggle Off Sabotage UI :\u00a0</strong>R\r\n</p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>USED ASSETS\u00a0</strong>--------</p>\n<p>SYNTY Knights &amp; Fantasy Package</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217</p>\n<p>Longsowrd Animations (Combat)</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/longsword-animset-pro-92239<br/></p>\n<p>Some animations are from Mixamo.</p>\n<p>Other than these everything is done by hand.
