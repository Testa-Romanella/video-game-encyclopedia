{"id": 759820, "slug": "dino-run-benjamin-seguin", "name": "Dino Run (Benjamin Seguin)", "name_original": "Dino Run (Benjamin Seguin)", "description": "<p>Dino Run\u00ae is an eclectic first-person shooter akin to hit games like Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege, or The Divide. The robust crafting system along with the game's numerous survival mechanics will really put your resourcefulness and creativity to the test. The Puzzle elements, which IGN was quoted as saying \"are like Tetris, but not shitty unlike that horrible game\" will leave you challenged and wanting more. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine WISHES that it was Dino Run. This game is comparable to the original Apple Personal Computer, it's visionary in the field and innovates where other games have never before. If you've ever used an Easy Bake Oven, the sweet smell of baked brownies will bring a tear to your eye. With all of that preface aside, please enjoy this game. Proceed with caution, however, as nothing you will play after this will ever live up to what you're about to experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f5477857ac578595e8a9050ea4f75dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Benjamin Seguin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
