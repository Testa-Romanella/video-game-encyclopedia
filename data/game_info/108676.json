Check out the new screenshots to see the people climbing around the more complex creations. Please download V0.2 to try it out.</p><p><strong>Update (2016/08/30 - 7:00 AM):</strong> AI pathfinding is broken and I am working on a fix. You can still build structures but don't expect the people to find ways up them.</p><p>Lil' Logs is a game about crafting and building.</p><p>You start out in a forest with a small camp nearby. You can take trees around you and turn them into blocks, ramps, and houses for the people. If there are houses, over time more people will \"appear\".</p><p>Controls:<br/></p><ul><li>Trigger: grab items</li><li>Menu<ul><li>While holding a craftable item: Bring up the crafting menu.</li></ul><ul><li>While holding a cloud: Remove cloud.</li><li>While holding nothing: Creates a cloud.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Clouds are your inventory. Just have a cloud nearby and stick an object in it to get it out of the way. Multiple items can be stored in a cloud, but they all must be of the same type. </p><p>AI pathfinding is buggy after placing a lot of items. I don't actually expect the people to climb towers. If the pathfinding works, the people will gather in nearby houses or around camp fires.</p><p>Sorry, no saving/loading yet. If enough people like the game, I'll add it in later.</p><p>Bonus: </p><p>Original mock designs</p><p>Development screenshots</p>Known bugs in V0.2:<br/><ul><li>Picking up and placing blocks too fast causes the game to stop letting you pick up blocks. I'm not sure what causes this, but just wait at least one second before placing a block you just picked up for now.</li><li>Camp fires are almost invisible in clouds.</li><li>Camp fires like to color clouds (Bug in VRTK?)</li></ul>Known bugs in V0.1:<ul><li>When creating logs by pulling off the leaves on a tree, the log preview placed object will be a tree instead of a log. </li><li>Things can be attached to the sides of logs and leaves, but leaves and logs cannot be attached sideways to other things.</li><li>Camp fires are almost invisible in clouds.</li><li>Camp fires like to color clouds (Bug in VRTK?)</li><li>Most of the AI Pathfinding (I'm amazed how much actually works)<ul><li>Some people will revisit scenery on their way to a location.<br/>(Graph nodes can be visited more than once.)</li><li>Some people like to take the long way to a location.<br/>(Some graph nodes may not be reachable after placing or removing blocks)</li><li>Placing and removing a block next to the house allows people to walk through that wall of the house. </li><li>People don't like it when you place ramps in order of decreasing height. To please the people, place them in order of increasing height.<br/>(Graph nodes only connect properly when you place a ramp after the lower block has already been placed.)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/22530eb9334d862a507c6c361a88fa03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cyanlaser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
