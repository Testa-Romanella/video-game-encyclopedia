(Hint: Not in this release.)<br/><br/>Perhaps you can guide the planet to safe harbour somewhere in the outer reaches of the galaxy? (Hint: You won't... it's just meteors. Forever.)<br/><br/>All you can do for now is Blow!..No, really. That's literally all you can do.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5039a354d79027a54e0d014e4810e9.jpg", "website": "http://extinctionlevelelephant.blogspot.co.uk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Wayne Smith"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Wayne Smith"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
