I personally created the Enemy AI, The Boss, and level 6 and 7 as well as\u00a0 some weapon interaction and physics.\u00a0 The rest of the game is basically a broken mess, so here are just the parts I created. Keep in mind these are using other broken features from the rest of the game, and they themselves are very much flawed, but they are at least beatable :).</p>\n<p>We only had about a week and a half\u00a0 to create it, and many of the other team member were not able to contribute very much due to scheduling or other constraints, so it was not nearly as polished as I would have liked. However, I think it is interesting nonetheless. Hope you\u00a0 enjoy out garbage fire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fdc763154b79378dadfa36f0678f9b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaffeinatedLemur"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
