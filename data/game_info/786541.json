First of all I was completly sick and wasnt really in the mood to do anything but at least I did something. It could have been better but I feel like this is good enough for my first ever project. Most of the UI and Objects were made by \"levtheking\". And I know I messed up with the UI. I dont really know how to change that, so Im sorry-<br/><br/>The Goal of this Game is to collect all of the 7 flies before the Time runs out. If the Time runs out youll be sent back to the home screen and if you collect all 7\u00a0youll also be sent back to the homescreen. Anyways I hope you have a little bit of fun at least.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T10:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7eea1cc9d20cff626fe1980e5a46bc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hobbzz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
