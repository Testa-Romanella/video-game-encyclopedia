In summary, 4 players represented by fantasy monsters\u00a0battle for control of the center of the board. Pieces standing on any of the four central tiles will collect resources every turn; the first player to reach 2000 resources wins the match.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>- Mouse left button: click to select a piece/move/attack an enemy piece.</p>\n<p>- Mouse right button\u00a0or arrow keys: adjust the camera.</p>\n<p>- Mouse wheel: scroll to zoom in or out.</p>\r\nRULES\r\n<p>- Turn order is randomized at the beginning of the match.</p>\n<p>- A player can move all of their available pieces during their turn, or finish early by pressing the \"End Turn\" button.</p>\n<p>- Movement is performed by clicking on\u00a0a piece, then clicking on an adjacent tile.</p>\n<p>- Moving over friendly or enemy pieces will push them to the next adjacent tile. There is no limit to how many aligned pieces can be pushed at once.</p>\n<p>- Enemy pieces standing in a diagonal tile can be attacked, which removes them from the board and takes their position.</p>\n<p>- Pieces can also be removed from the board by pushing them into a\u00a0pit.</p>\n<p>- Any pieces removed from the board are revived at the beginning of their owner's turn, back at their starting positions. Pieces cannot move on the same turn they are revived.</p>\n<p>- Each monster race has a special ability which activates under certain conditions and changes the rules of the game. Consult the in-game Tutorial for more information.</p>\r\nADDITIONAL INFO\r\n<p>Click the small red button beside each player on the title screen to activate AI controls or disable a player entirely. The game can be enjoyed by up to 4 players locally, hot-seat style, by alternating turns on the same device.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>- Game Design by Gr\u00e9gory Torres</p>\n<p>- Programming by Gr\u00e9gory Torres and Newton Brandalize J\u00fanior</p>\n<p>- Art by Gr\u00e9gory Torres and Fabr\u00edcio Farias Arag\u00e3o</p>\n<p>- Sound effects downloaded from Freesounds.org</p>\n<p>- Music by Kevin McLeod (Imcompetech.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T09:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b661f09ffa270fffac1b71d1fcf1c0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamuraiPenguinZ"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
