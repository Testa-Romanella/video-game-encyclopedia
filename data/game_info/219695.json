Instead of playing alone, you are competing against the entire world for the best score!<br/>Each game costs 52 points. Each card placed in the foundation stacks scores you 5 points. With each game you play you can build your score higher, or knock it back down.<br/>When you think you have a good enough score to post it, you can submit it to GameCenter.<br/>In addition, Championship Solitaire is a nice-looking solitaire game that gracefully resizes to fit the screen sizes of any iOS device, both horizontally and vertically.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a0ae7155f4ae1d41a7bbe28cda02e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CleverMedia"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["CleverMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
