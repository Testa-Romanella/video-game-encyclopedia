Then your Angelic and Devilish sides will appear and you have to try and click the Angel to proceed. It's randomized so be careful when you click or you won't know what's going to happen. There are quite a few different outcomes depending on whether you click the Angel or Devil.\u00a0<br/><br/>Wanted to keep the responses ambiguous so the player can fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>Very short game but hopefully it means people can get the full experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Z/LEFT KEY\u00a0</strong>\u00a0- select left Angel/Devil</p>\n<p><strong>X/RIGHT KEY</strong> - select right \u00a0Angel/Devil</p>\n<p><strong>Or you can just use the MOUSE</strong></p>\n<p>Ludum Dare Voting Page Link</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87e/87e75d4057db9afa49d06c3cca3c116a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Franklin's Ghost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
