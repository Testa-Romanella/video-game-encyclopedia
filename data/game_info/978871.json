{"id": 978871, "slug": "avatar-star-online", "name": "Avatar Star Online", "name_original": "Avatar Star Online", "description": "<p>Avatar Star is a multiplayer, third-person shooter game in which various players can face off in closed arenas, using cute characters that you can personalize to your liking.</p>\n<p>Character personalization, an essential feature of any online game worth its salt, is especially important in Avatar Star. The first thing that you have to do is choose the class of your avatar (assassin, marksman, or guardian), and then you can make use of any of the hundreds of different elements at your disposal to create a unique character.</p>\n<p>Many of the personalization options are free, but there are a bunch more than you can buy using game money, which you can acquire through in-game actions or by purchasing it with real money. Once you&#39;ve created and customized your avatar, it&#39;s time for the fun to begin: shooting. Players can participate in different scenes with different objectives; the common theme is to bombard your enemies. For every kill you make, you receive experience.</p>\n<p>The experience you win in Avatar Star helps you gain levels for your character and get new (and better) special abilities. And it&#39;s not just your character that can gain levels, you can improve your weapons this way as well. Avatar Star is a fun and attractive third-person shooter game. Its cartoon aesthetic fits perfectly with a multiplayer game that, owing to its simplicity and the absence of blood and offensive elements, can be enjoyed by all ages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T11:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/640/64037b37614ab2259816e59226994aa6.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/AvatarStarThai/posts/978404199019791", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Pearl Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["cherry"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
