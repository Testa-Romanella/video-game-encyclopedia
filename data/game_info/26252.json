Let your imagination run wild when light meets \n      everyday objects to create fascinating shadows!

ShadowPlay challenges players by transforming \n      shadows into over 100 exciting, unique puzzles.

Winning a round will allow players to advance to the next level \n      as well as score another item to use in the Free Play Mode where you can \n      unleash your imagination and create your own shadow art. Family and \n      friends can also jump in to help tackle a puzzle at any time using Local \n      Co-op Mode! ShadowPlay will provide tons of brain-racking fun for \n      players of all ages!
