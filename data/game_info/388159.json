And in the wake of decades of resource wars and superstorms, all of these Americas are less important than the multinational megacorps warring over the corpse of the old America.<br/><br/>Our story concerns itself chiefly with the American Union and its corporate masters.<br/><br/>Axis Inc.\u00a0is a massive international megacongolomerate majority owned by the aristocratic\u00a0Smythe\u00a0family. Initially a defense contractor (and still active in that sector, from small arms to aircraft), Axis has been responsible for most of the American Union's crucial infrastructure for many years. Prison privatization was nothing new by the 2050s, but by 2064 every prison in the American Union was officially Axis run and proud of it.<br/><br/>Elected by the peerless political influence of the\u00a0Smythe Super-PAC, President Sara Wallace legalized private police forces in the same year. The civic experiment of\u00a0privatizing the entire police force of the city of Detroit\u00a0with Axis corporate security forces was quickly repeated in other cities, including Philadelphia, Washington DC, and the flooded ruins of New York.<br/><br/>Not every\u00a0red-blooded American\u00a0in the American Union was happy with the\u00a0corporate kleptocracy\u00a0seizing their nation. Spurred on by footage of gross corruption and police brutality, spontaneous riots broke out across cities across the AU, especially violent and hard to contain in cities where Axis was in the process of taking over the policing. Out of the chaos of these riots, two \"domestic terrorist\" organizations appeared seemingly from nowhere to take center stage in the public debate: the Chicago-based\u00a0Patriots Against Corporate Tyranny (PACT), and the Philadelphia-based\u00a0Sons of Liberty.<br/><br/>After years of insurgency waged against Axis Incorporated facilities, personnel, and infrastructure by P.A.C.T. and SoL cells,\u00a0on November 8th, 2072, Aleister Smythe, board member and CIO of Axis Incorporated, was elected President of the American Union. Against still rising protests, in May of the following year, Axis Incorporated purchased the national debt of the American Union (much of it left over from the USA) from its creditors. For the first time ever,\u00a0a major world nation\u00a0(and former superpower) owed a debt of $33 trillion dollars not to its fellow nations but to a\u00a0private corporate landlord.<br/><br/>The age of the corporate nation-state had begun.</p>\n<em>The stage is set, don't forget to breathe...</em>\n<p>Hadley Spencer Sinclair\u00a0is a 17 year old girl with no choice but to be wise beyond her years, doing the best she can to survive in the small community of\u00a0Market Street Underground, located somewhere in the subway tunnels, subterranean pedestrian walkways, concourses and sewers beneath\u00a0Center City, Philadelphia. Her parents were members of P.A.C.T. and were allegedly shot by Axis security forces \"while resisting arrest\".<br/><br/>Sammy\u00a0is a tough, streetwise 12 year old kid whose parents were killed or taken in a massive protest in Washington, DC: he followed the directions given to him, which lead him ultimately to Hadley, her too being an orphan. Since then she's taken care of him like a big sister.<br/><br/>It's April 18th, 2076.\u00a0Congress is expected to vote on an Axis-backed, Axis-ordered motion to\u00a0repeal the 22nd Amendment\u00a0of the US Constitution (under which the UA still operates), removing the two-term limit on the UA Presidency. Everyone with suspicions about Axis or sympathies for the various anti-corporate movements throughout the country fears the same thing should this motion actually pass: Aleister Smythe as\u00a0President for Life.<br/><br/>Hadley has stayed out of politics, having enough struggle and strife to deal with just keeping herself and Sammy alive. But the political has a way of becoming personal, as Hadley finds out, when Sammy sneaks out to attend a massive public demonstration held by the Sons of Liberty, and she has to follow him there. Without knowing it, she has taken her first steps to become a soldier in the\u00a0New American Revolution.<br/><br/>(Yes, those were\u00a0<em>Shadowrun\u00a0</em>references in that first paragraph, good eye.
