If one falls it turns into a ghost block, and the other player can pass over it. There is also music that indicates your player movement!<br/></p>\n<p>There is also cool features like levers, enemies, respawn blocks...</p>\n<p>Get to the end to escape!</p>\n\n<p>All the game was made by <strong>@ItsAssasin </strong>:)</p>\n<p>Also this is my first \"game\" submited to itch.io, i know it has got bugs and its not very confortable, but i had to do it in less than 6 days. I also know the resolution is not the optimal, but is the only thing i can do, the timeline is like 20m away xd.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9cd42ced40144b96af776dcb3ca17dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ItsAssasin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
