My goal for the camp is to have the students work on a game by building objects and giving them behaviours using the Drag'N'Drop system within GameMaker: Studio. The students have the freedom to edit any of the art, sounds, music, and create levels while familiarizing themselves with how to make a game.</p><p>I worked with an artist and musician to provide the students multiple assets that they could mix and match while creating their games. Below you can try out the various versions of the game.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/><arrow keys=\"\"> to move<br/><esc> to quit<br/><r> to restart</r></esc></arrow></p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Design/Development: Justin Luk<br/>Artwork: Alex Ashby<br/>Music: Chuck Bergeron<br/>Sound Effects: Bfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e5112caaabfbf2d09739c272a0c1b372.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madcapacity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
