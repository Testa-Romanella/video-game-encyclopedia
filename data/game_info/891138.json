Well kid...you've got spunk, I'll give you that. I guess you're one of those 'free spirited' types that are all the rage nowadays. Anyways...Flight Club ain't a cakewalk, so you better buckle up. Passion is good, but it'll\u00a0only get ya so far. It's all about hard work and dedication where I come from. With a little bit of elbow-grease, we'll get you certified in no time. Stick with me, and you'll\u00a0be a bonafide flight savant if I have anything to say about it. Good luck kid!\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Hi everyone! Flight Club is a small prototype that was born from\u00a0our\u00a0love for the Pilotwings game series by Nintendo. We all wore many hats on the project, but\u00a0Coopal00ps spent most of his time on the art and UI,\u00a0Pandamander took point on design and\u00a0also contributed to the art, and Elliott created the character\u00a0and handled the gameplay programming. We're really proud of this one, and we hope that you enjoy! Now let's see if you can get that \"A\" rank...\ud83c\udfc5</p>\r\nGAME CONTROLS\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left arrow / A</strong> - rotate left</li><li><strong>Right arrow</strong>\u00a0<strong>/ D</strong> - rotate right</li><li><strong>Up arrow</strong>\u00a0<strong>/ W</strong> - rotate thrusters back</li><li><strong>Down arrow</strong><strong>\u00a0/ S</strong> - rotate thrusters forward</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - activate thrusters</li><li><strong>E</strong> - air brake</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>This game is a collaboration between\u00a0Coopal00ps,\u00a0Pandamander, and Elliott Dahle.
