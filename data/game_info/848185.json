If you chose wrong, you can try again - and even get a hint if you want one.</p>\n<p>You can also hit the Questions button in the top right to view your entire conversation, as well as examine a logic table showing various possible responses to your last question.</p>\n<p>Also, don't worry if you choose wrong and lose a balloon - they're not worth anything more than bragging points!
