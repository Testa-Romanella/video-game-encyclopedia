As such, we have decided to create a game that takes place in a sky with a platform that keeps spawning at the same time with the coins and the obstacles. The obstacles cannot be predicted as it will spawn randomly on the platform. Therefore, the player needs to be careful and focus when turning left or right. The player is also chased by the UFO at the start of the game and if the player dies within the gameplay, the UFO will then suck the player up into the UFO. The coin in this game allows the player to buy three different characters in the shop with its own unique abilities such as running at a faster speed, collecting double the coins, and invincibility when going through obstacles which prevents the player from dying.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf086a209ebc3cbc9851403f0da5109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AbhinavChemikala"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
