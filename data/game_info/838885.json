The game runs on 64x64 resolution, to fit the Jam requirements, and then\u00a0scaled 7x to improve screen readability. This is a procedurally generated drilling game with lots of RPG aspects, such as leveling up and learning new abilities, fighting enemies in a turn-based fashion, and creating strategies to defeat the bosses!</p><p>But here's the twist: you use the resources you gather when drilling to be able to use your skills in the turn-based combat! Different resources allow different skills, and some of them scale with specific stats! Play around different builds to win against each one of the three bosses!</p><p>And don't worry, if you lose you can always try again. You lose all resources,\u00a0but you keep your level, skills, and\u00a0you respawn at the latest checkpoint.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Controls\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>There are multiple control schemes for this game.</p><p>You can play with arrow keys +\u00a0Z to drill and X to jump, in PICO-8 style.</p><p>You can play with WASD and use the left mouse button to drill, and the right one to jump.</p><p>You can also play with WASD, using E to drill and space-bar to jump!</p><p>(Or you can mix and match the control schemes, all of them work concurrently)</p><p>Gamepad is also supported, but untested! (please let me know if there's anything wonky)</p><p>You can point the drill towards all 4 directions (up, down, left right). Additionally, there's a jetpack you can use by holding the jump button.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Content\u00a0</p><p>The game currently has 3 different \"kinds\" of levels. All levels are procedurally generated, which means they are always randomized upon starting. However, each level may have biases towards certain resources or spawns.</p><p>The levels are horizontally infinite, and each boss can be found at a certain depth.</p><p>\u00a0How to Play\u00a0</p><ul><li>Gather Resources.</li><li> Drill blocks with enemies on them.</li><li>Defeat those enemies.</li><li>Gain experience.</li><li>Level up! You can choose between drill power, jetpack fuel and max HP.</li><li>Please note that some skills scale off different stats!</li><li>The stats are also useful on your drilling expeditions, not only during combat.</li><li>Find and defeat the level boss!</li></ul><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credits\u00a0</p><p>All assets in the game were made for the game, by me. The font is also custom. This game was made in 2 weeks. There are some missing assets because I\u00a0didn't have enough time to make them (such as an intro music, a battle fanfare, etc). There is music and sound in the game, though.</p><p>Please let me know if you like it! Thank you all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca7bb3fb3e7c0cd92069f5453cd3321b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thinker"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
