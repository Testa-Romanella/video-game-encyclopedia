The game was made with love2d, and boy did we put lots of love into it. Due to certain circumstances we wound up changing the goals and nature of our game from puzzle shooter to vn, and we struggled at the end to get enough content into the game. We both worked really really hard, and I'm really proud of our work in such a short amout of time, going from nothing to this. <br/><br/>Basically, only 2 of the 6 characters have legitimate fully fleshed out routes, there is one test route that the other 4 characters use. Sorry. We hope to update the game soon with music and full routes for all characters. Other than that, it's essentially complete. <br/></p>\n<p>All art was done by emil (emaware on itch)</p>\n<p>All codes were done by bulb (g4stly on itch)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df8c5693aef08187914db1b207148fe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["g4stly", "emaware"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
