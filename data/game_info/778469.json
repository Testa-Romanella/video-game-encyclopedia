Nothing is perfect, because perfect doesn\u2019t exist; there will always be little conflicts, little collapses, little works-in-progress. But we made the right choices, the better choices, and we had time to take action, to heal, to grow. Our cities are greener and bluer. We are no longer strangers to wilderness or wildlife. Fungi, plants, animals, and humans all coexist together, learn together, and we adapt alongside each other. This is the brighter future.</em></p>\n<p><em>Heed the mistakes of the past, so that one day you too can experience this future.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: Left &amp; Right arrow keys/\"S&amp;D\"</p>\n<p>Jump; Spacebar</p>\n<p>Interact: \"E\"</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Producer: Sean Patrick McCarthy\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming: Adam\u00a0 Tollios and Beckett\u00a0Anderhous-Custer</p>\n<p>Designer/Level Design: John Novak and\u00a0\u00a0Teodoro \"Jay Jay\" Santiago</p>\n<p>Writer: Benny Froha</p>\n<p>Music: Garrett Rose</p>\n<p>Art: SJ Singh</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Getty Images and Shutterstock!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d78e80acbe72d902e47c9d90e87b38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GarrettRose", "SJ", "Jaaaayyyy", "Slimpop", "Fuzzgun", "TooMystical"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
