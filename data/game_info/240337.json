Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!<br/><br/>Are you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.<br/>You\u2019re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you\u2019ll fall in love with curling and our game.<br/><br/>Curling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.<br/><br/>Curling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.<br/><br/>Feature Highlights:<br/>\u2022 Realistic, hi-res, 3D simulation of Curling <br/>\u2022 Complete control of force, direction, and rotation of the stone <br/>\u2022 Advanced features permit tactics used in actual play of the game called \"chess on ice\" <br/>\u2022 Detailed instructions for gameplay <br/>\u2022 Can be played by one player against the computer, or two players against each other <br/>\u2022 Exploits advanced physics engine of iPhone OS to simulate realistic motion <br/>\u2022 Easy and intuitive controls <br/>\u2022 Incorporates the true rules of curling <br/>\u2022 Player vs. computer (artificial intelligence) with three levels of difficulty <br/>\u2022 Multiplayer gameplay for two players <br/>\u2022 A variety of character models <br/>\u2022 Choice of player sex and 21 countries for teams <br/>\u2022 Scoring of intermediate and total results <br/>\u2022 FaceBook &amp; Twitter Integration <br/>\u2022 Support for the Retina display <br/>\u2022 Detailed graphics and animation <br/>\u2022 Excellent sound design <br/><br/>Try it\u2026 you won\u2019t be disappointed.<br/><br/>- Now you can take part in the Tournament!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/182b25b382d33d655fe24982e89bdfe7.jpg", "website": "http://maxnick.com/products/curling3d/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MaxNick"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Nikolay Verevkin"], "esrb_rating": null}
