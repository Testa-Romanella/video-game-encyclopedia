Plunge into the depths of toilets to eradicate the faceless turds that threaten the face-full turds and all they stand for. Go through six different, but very original restaurants defeating the horrors that live within the bathroom using only your plunger. Once the turd is far enough down the pipe, flush the toilet to finish it off. Be careful, some turds will pop back up for more, and if the turd is too big when you flush, it will overflow the toilet!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T12:35:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91ede2db99a992e8fcd436d9779a5e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derrick Davison"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Derrick Davison"], "esrb_rating": null}
