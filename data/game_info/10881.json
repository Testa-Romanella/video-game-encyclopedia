The game breaks molds moving away from the typical shmup game, avoiding the space theme mixing vertical and horizontal scrolling stages with very varied game mechanics. Each stage is very different from the previous stage: one level we could be fighting scorpions, another defending the hive collecting pollen, dodging birds, raiding caves behind waterfalls protected by angry fish or we could be escaping from the wasp-hive after just killing the queen.<br/><br/>Beekyr Reloaded has 28 levels across 4 colorful worlds, going darker with every stage. First levels, full of colour, display naivety and happiness. The later, dark with cold fog and evil creatures lurking between plants full of spikes.<br/><br/>.Features<ul><li>Mold-breaking theme: Shmup based in world of insects<br/></li><li>3 different endings<br/></li><li>16 special enemy bosses to fight<br/></li><li>Secret playable characters<br/></li><li>Secret unlockable stages<br/></li><li>Enormous re-playability (: 4 different stage combinations that might offer more or less levels (from 18 to 28 stages) depending on some game events and difficulty mode<br/></li><li>Designed for all types of players.
