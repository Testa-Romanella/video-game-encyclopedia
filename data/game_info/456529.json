By the time Apple had rejected it several times, weeks had passed and the joke didn't seem as funny.</p>\n<p>I considered releasing the game on itch.io as pay-what-you-want with proceeds going to charity, but didn't feel particularly motivated to do so.</p>\n<p>Then, George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police and America's dark history of racism and violence took center stage in the national consciousness.</p>\n<p>Don't Touch Your Face is a stupid, silly little game, but if you want to pay money for it, I will donate 100% of the proceeds to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</p>\n<p>#BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game,</p>\n<p>-Aaron</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c18440d6763a868936caa54a3f6e516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["swivelmaster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
