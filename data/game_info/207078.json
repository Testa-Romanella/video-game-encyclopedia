My game placed top 20 and received an honorable mention! This is the first complete game I developed using the Unity Engine and I learned much about it and C# programming. I also learned much about actually finishing a game and learning how to cut features and reduce scope while still building a fun game. My friend and I collaborated on the art and sound effects, which were very fun to produce!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4b/c4b01936898b17ab5d2517849f6abe38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfc3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
