Can you beat all AI opponents?</p><p>After you've practised on the AI opponents, it's time for online multiplayer! Fight a friend in either normal or strategic mode. Strategic mode is time-based, and thus eliminates 'button-bashing' \u2013 instead: it is all about outsmarting your opponent!</p><p>Do you have what it takes to become the #1 rated Taido Jissen player in the world?</p><p>Out of our love for Taido came the inspiration to build a game! Taido is a Japanese martial art that emphasises movement, creativity, development and having fun.</p><p>What makes this game unique is the control system, which resembles Taido's \"Sotai\" system of movement. The result is a mobile game with a fun combat system and exceptionally rich fighting mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509b1af37c5957e23f4c42d245d64f1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaidoWarrior"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
