{"id": 778789, "slug": "tavern-philanthropy", "name": "Tavern Philanthropy", "name_original": "Tavern Philanthropy", "description": "<p>A lord living his life in pampered luxury is suddenly encounters the ghost of his grandfather telling him that in order to truly be a good person, he must do good things, such as donating his gold to the person in the old tavern with the most sincere story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for OGA Spring Jam for the theme Philanthropy\u00a0and has 3 endings. I originally was trying to make a different game, but it was more complicated than I expected so I switched to a short Twine game on the last game of the jam. I plan to polish it after the jam.</p>\n<p>Edit: This game can be played in browser, but currently, you have to download the zipfile and open the .hmtl from your computer to be able to view the images. I initially uploaded the picture folder instead of the whole folder, so I am uploading the correct folder with the .html file and image folder.\u00a0 The downloadable game\u00a0should be playable now (I hope).</p><p>Credits</p><p>Tavern background</p>\n<p>Author: Nila122</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/tavern-background</p>\n<p>Halloween Pixel Art Characters (with cute &amp; creepy variants)</p>\n<p>Author: davepickett</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/halloween-pixel-art-characters-with-cute-creepy-...</p>\n<p>Thief portrait - Male</p>\n<p>Author: Zeldyn</p>\n<p>(Submitted by bart)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/thief-portrait-male</p>\n<p>Priest portrait - Male</p>\n<p>Author: Zeldyn</p>\n<p>(Submitted by bart)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/priest-portrait-male</p>\n<p>Portrait: Male Fighter</p>\n<p>Author: Zeldyn</p>\n<p>(Submitted by bart)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/portrait-male-fighter</p>\n<p>[Logo Splash Screens for OpenGameArt.org's Spring Game Jam 2022</p>\n<p>By Scott Matott sXe</p>\n<p>Released under CC-BY 3.0 License</p>\n<p>Background: ramses2099</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/background-12</p>\n<p>used under terms of CC0</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode</p>\n<p>Sara--Steps in the Right Direction: Redshrike</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/sara-steps-in-the-right-direction</p>\n<p>used under terms of CC-BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode</p>\n<p>Painted Sara: laetissima</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/painted-sara</p>\n<p>used under terms of CC-BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode</p>\n<p>A package of 8-bit fonts for Grafx2 and Linux: usr_share</p>\n<p>http://opengameart.org/content/a-package-of-8-bit-fonts-for-grafx2-and-linux used under terms of CC0</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62cec3b20a952b6244558ca746ecb5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kobato Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
