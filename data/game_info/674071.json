An ability that you can trigger when you are close to a character.<br/>- H to heal your team out of battle(no code for managing \"Game Over\" situations).<br/>- Y is a \"Mount\" that allows you to go faster. Press again to remove it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>PS: \"K\" and \"L\" were chosen to avoid dealing with compatibility problems involving QWERTY and AZERTY keyboards.</em></p>\n<p><strong>BATTLE SYSTEM MECHANICS</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Spells</em>: Your main source of damage. This is also how you get stacks(bottom left corner). \u00a0The stack that you get depends on the element that you use, meaning that if you use a \"Mars\" spell, you get a \"Mars\" stack. After having enough stacks you can cast more powerful spells called \"Synergies\".\u00a0</li><li><em>Synergies</em>: This is how to deal tje \"big damage\". Every synergy has a cost and you need to consume stacks to be able to cast it.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li><em>Saiments</em>: You can't use items in battle, only saiments. Saiments are similar to items but they have their own system. At the end of every turn you draw a saiment(randomly from your deck). Every saiment has an \"effect\" that you can use instead of casting a spell/synergy. Every saiment you use is consumed and you can't use it again(unless you start a new battle).\u00a0</li><li><em>Ultimate Draw</em>: This is a mechanic that allows you to get any saiment you want from your deck(can only be used once per battle).\u00a0</li><li><em>Turn Effects</em>: After every 5 turns a random effect is triggered. Since the game is in early development, only basic effects like getting back HP/MP are available.</li><li><em>Dynamic Music</em>: The battle theme isn't always static. It changes based on the situation(for example your Plano/Monster having low HP or the enemy boss having one Plano left).\u00a0</li></ul><p><strong>GOOD TO KNOW</strong></p><p>- All the wild Planos and their dark forms can be found in the second\u00a0room (in the huge blue carpet).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS THAT CAN MAKE THE GAME CRASH(YOU NEED TO RESTART)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Using the spell Ice Shards(especially level 2) can make the game crash.\u00a0<br/>- Exp bar decreases/restarts sometimes.\u00a0<br/>- Losing against bosses(Reysia,\u00a0Nephasto Or Senryu) will not trigger any code so you won't be able to fight them again.\u00a0<br/>- Spells animations not displaying while fighting against the final boss \"Senryu\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more info, check the YouTube channel\u00a0here.<br/>Or Twitter\u00a0here.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/7800d29760a32c4fd2af24aa1bab5a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noursaidana"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
