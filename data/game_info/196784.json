You play as a sentient tomato trying to survive the harsh environment it lives in - living through acidic rain, thunder, and even some bombs (because why not?). Collect coins and see how long you can survive! And the longer you live, the tougher the environment becomes so beware!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d16c2b7cd8b90e9810d803f0b4935b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HiImAlecGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
