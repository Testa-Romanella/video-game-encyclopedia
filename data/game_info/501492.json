Use your observation skills and code blocks to track them down and hit 'em with your <em>ZAPPER!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>PERFORMANCE ISSUES</strong>: if you are experiencing lag, please download the native version for your operating system. The HTML5 version seems to struggle a bit.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play (TL;DR version)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Each level has a bunch of balls in a grid. One or more of those balls are an \"invader\". You need to figure out which balls are invaders, and then zap them with your zapper! (spacebar)</p>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>When an invader touches a regular ball, that ball's number will go up exactly 1 second later, <strong>but the invader's number will never change</strong>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Trying to spot the invaders with your eyes alone is not going to be easy because there is usually too much going on.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create <strong>while</strong> blocks to trap balls, and create <strong>if</strong> blocks to create barriers.<strong> </strong>This enables you to control the movement of the balls, and makes it easier to spot the invader(s)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>An easy trick to narrow the search for the invader is to collect each number into a separate <strong>while</strong> block (easier said than done!). If you manage to do this, you'll know what the invader's number is by looking at the while block that is <em>leaking</em> data.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>If you capture all of the data that leaks from a <strong>while</strong> loop, then eventually, the while block will contain nothing but the invader(s)!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b377987e3cce82a6f2ef5834ff73696c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Alex"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
