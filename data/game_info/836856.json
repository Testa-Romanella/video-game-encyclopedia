Because we definitely don't live in one already.</p>\n<p>Play as Jack, a pregnant trans man in a world where most people are infertile. Except he doesn't want to have a baby, and the only person who can help him has been kidnapped. Can you free her and get an abortion?<br/></p>\n<p>This game has been made by Aaron El Sabrout (he/him) and Freddy Cleveland (she/they), with music by Claire DeLuca (she/her). Special thanks to Gemmy System for their ren'py wizardry assistance!</p><p>Due to its subject matter, this game is not recommended for young kids. It's probably best for ages 16+. It also deals with topics of sexual violence so please consider that before playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T10:45:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea6226feaa5b81e181a57eae8c6bc824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["toreachpoise"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
