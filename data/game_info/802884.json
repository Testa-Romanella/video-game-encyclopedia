{"id": 802884, "slug": "kriegsspiel-7-years-war", "name": "Kriegsspiel - 7 years war", "name_original": "Kriegsspiel - 7 years war", "description": "<p>Kriegsspiel is a real time strategy game, where you play as a general of an army.</p>\n<p>The general does not directly move its troops, and does not see what they see (the fog of war is not shared). Instead, it sends couriers with orders to its troops, and waits for couriers with reports to have its intelligence updated. This induces \"lag\" in the operations, making the game slower than other RTS, but also preventing micro-management. It takes place during 7 years war (1756-1763).\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a personal project, so ... yeah it is ugly, but I intend to collect founds to continue to develop it and recruit artists or buy assets for 2D graphics, 3D models and animations, and sounds and music.</p>\n<p>Head video explains game concepts. Feel free to watch it, and/or download the game (it contains a tutorial and a mini campaign), and send your comments. Thank your for having readen me !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:45:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/2963f4d6aab7fe8bd45c3c70d2810bab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["franzoar"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
