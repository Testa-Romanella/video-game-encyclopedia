{"id": 510680, "slug": "gravewood", "name": "Gravewood", "name_original": "Gravewood", "description": "<p><strong>This game was created for Bit Bridge Indies Halloween Game Jam.\u00a0It was started on\u00a017/10/20, and completed a week later on 24/10/20.</strong></p>\n<p>As a result, you may encounter typos, grammatical errors, visual aberrations or coding anomalies. Please\u00a0report them, and I'll fix them as soon as possible!\u00a0Also, please forgive some default settings. The game is very long and heavily-illustrated for a week-long Jam, and time was very tight for me at the end.</p>\n<p>==========================================</p>\n<p><strong>You're a young woman living in the heart of a dark and dismal swampland.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's time for the ritual of Season's End, and the Elder of the village selects you to fulfil a special mission: you have to\u00a0find four Pearls of the Earth, special stones that emerge from places of suffering or grief.\u00a0To help you with this special task, a senior warrior accompanies you as your companion - a person who you can choose to merely tolerate, or treat with care.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to the parasitic tree planted in your spine, you're ready to\u00a0protect the village from the dangers of the outside world at any\u00a0cost.</strong></p>\n<p>==========================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Explore the open marshland via a map!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The narrative is modular and can change depending on when you visit certain areas and what you do there! Many choices and engagements depend on your route!</p>\n<p><strong>Four Endings!</strong></p>\n<p>A walkthrough is included with the Readme file for added convenience, and in case you need some help!</p>\n<p>==========================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game has a splash page that will warn you of its content! The visuals are not very grisly, but some of the writing is moreso. Please take care with\u00a0your own comfort and limits!</p>\n<p>The game features: Horror, body horror, parasitism, corpses, death, insects, monsters\u00a0and physical trauma. The writing is often gory but the art is minimal for these sections.</p>\n<p>==========================================</p>\n<p>Gravewood was produced by\u00a0Cacoethic, of the microstudio\u00a0Inkethic.
