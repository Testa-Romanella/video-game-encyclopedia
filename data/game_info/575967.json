Press and hold mouse botton will generate a bullet, release the button will shoot the bullet to the point the camera is facing at that moment. The longer you press the button, the bigger the bullet, the bigger the damage of this bullet, also the bigger consumption of energy. The growing speed of the bullet is liner to the time you hold the button, but remeber the volume is the cube of the edge length, so it will looks like the bullet is\u00a0growing slower and slower, but is not actually. Same for the size of player and enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Every\u00a0 5 seconds there will be a enemy born in the air as long as there is currently less than 8 enemies in the world. Enemies will generate bullet with random size, firstly the bullet is very small, and will grow to the determined size with constant\u00a0speed in volume. Once it reach the size, it will\u00a0shoot to\u00a0the direction that the player\u00a0is currently in.\r\n</p>\n<p>Note that the bullet before shooting can be destoryed by bullets.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/4950178d57ddc8cd9f2d86494afcd64b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuzumiyaDeno"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
