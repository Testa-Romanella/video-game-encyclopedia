The goal was to show and grow our skills while implementing a fun story and gameplay concept that excited us. Whether or not this game will continue to grow is TBD. We hope you enjoy the demo experience and we'd love to hear your thoughts!\r\n</p>\r\nTHE STORY\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomething in the shadows has been re-born.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIt's up to one shrew to find the light and bring it back to the world.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tRumors have spread about a portal to the \"other\" world. Find it in order to stop the evil!\r\n</p>\r\nTHE OBJECTIVE\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are mystical statues in the nearby region.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSome seem to be holding their hands out for something like a torch\u2026 perhaps a lit one.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tOther statues seem to be holding their hands out for an oval like object or artifact.\r\n</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe shrew has been gifted with powers of Light.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tOne of these powers grants life to the shrew through the energy of Fireflies.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAnother power grants light to the eyes of the shrew.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tUse these powers to succeed in your mission.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBeware of the Owls! They are said to be servants of the shadows!\r\n</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>\r\n\tLead Design and Art\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBryan Tenorio\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tbryantenorio.com\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgramming and Design\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThunder Egg Concepts\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tthundereggconcepts.weebly.com\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic Theme Composition\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tApexion Music\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tfacebook.com/apexionmusic\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic Theme Mixing\r\n\t<br/>Michael Rodriguez\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tfacebook.com/thesocal/about\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSpecial Thanks\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAlbuquerque Game Developers Guild (AGDG)\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tagdg.co \r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\t#madeinunity 5.3.3\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA playable WebGL version is available \r\n\tHERE.
