I originally released this game in 1995.</p>\n<p>Originally named Antz with a 'z', this was an experimental game about controlling a cloud-like mass. Amiga journalist Tony Dillon glimpsed the game and raved about its brilliance, signing it up (without payment) for a commercial release with start-up publisher Kellion. With his contacts, many magazine reviews were secured, but all were, alas, terrible, and the game was instantly\u00a0dropped. I released the game as freeware.\u00a0I still find the incident amusing. The game was never intended to be\u00a0more than a PD release.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be49b64e94551790d47f696239a7d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
