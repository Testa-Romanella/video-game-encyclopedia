He dreamt that he was a large tuna fish and needed to make his way to Ohio. He could survive with little water and would jump from puddle to puddle. That's the game. You control Tuna Lockstin and time some flops to make it to the end.<br/><br/>I'll make a devlog talking about the process sometime next week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a parody &amp; was just made to practice &amp; learn more about game making.<br/></p>\n<p>All rights to Lockstin's likeness &amp; logos are withheld by Lockstin &amp; not me. If Lockstin has any issue with this game, I will take it down. This is only for fun and should not be sold in any way. Free to download or play, but I'd love to know what you think still!<br/>Do note, this game was made during free time over the course of a couple weeks, its a jam game and perfection was NOT the goal! Okay thank you, and thank you Lockstin for the idea &amp; the encouragement to make this dumb thing.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Music by Marllon Silva (xDeviruchi)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:51:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Splitfish"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
