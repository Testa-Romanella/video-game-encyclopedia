{"id": 44512, "slug": "ymir", "name": "Ymir", "name_original": "Ymir", "description": "<p>Ymir is a 4X multiplayer strategy game combined with a city builder where each player develops a civilization of Pigmen starting at the stone age.<br />\nThe game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region.<br />\nFeatures:<br />\n<em> Pigs with clothes.<br />\n</em> Multiplayer on local or persistent servers.<br />\n<em> Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own.<br />\n</em> Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique.<br />\n<em> 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading.<br />\n</em> Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players.<br />\n<em> Real-time battles.<br />\n</em> WILL remain free of any pay-to-win .<br />\nEconomy:<br />\n<em> No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation.<br />\n</em> Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues.<br />\n<em> Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs.<br />\n</em> Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy.<br />\n<em> A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging.<br />\n</em> Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you&#39;re not careful )<br />\nMilitary:<br />\n<em> Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities.<br />\n</em> Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements.<br />\n<em> With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops.<br />\n</em> Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges.<br />\n<em> A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle.<br />\n</em> Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress.<br />\n<em> Battles can include unlimited &#39;teams&#39; at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances.<br />\n</em> Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player&#39;s presence ).<br />\n<em> Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and mammoths.<br />\n2 game modes:<br />\n</em> Real-time mode : a &#39;classical&#39; mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions.<br />\n* Permanent mode : a more &quot;MMO&quot; mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-23T10:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc0783a780c2f4cdc309d2393ba196d.jpg", "website": "http://ymir-online.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 12, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thibaud Michaud"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thibaud Michaud"], "esrb_rating": null}
