It's worked in the past, but refuses to cooperate today. I'll fix it after the rating period of the jam.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Click and hold to charge up, and release to have the slime jump in the direction of the cursor! The slime sticks to Stone and Metal, while it slides down Glass. It does not stick to the ceilings. Lookout for purple orbs, these are checkpoints and will save your progress!</p>\n\n<p>Hello! This is my third game jam, and the first one where I've made all the pixel art and music by myself. I'm very new to pixel art, so do share your thoughts. The main menu was something I threw together in 5 mins due to not having time, but I think it turned out quite awesome. I think I just overthink too much ;P.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a few known bugs: <br/>Don't slide to the very corner of platforms as the player may become uncontrollable at that time. It does not happen often, but it is there.<br/>The tilemap may occasionally flicker with lines between the tiles. I fixed\u00a0this in the editor, and for some reason, Unity\u00a0seems to have decided to screw me over. Sorry about that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T14:09:24", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Spacejet13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
