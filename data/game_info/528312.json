The amount of ammo you have is shown at the bottom left (the little grey squares). If you run out, don't worry! because ammo is constantly spawning around the arena. Use the ammo to shoot the evil squares and get those sweet, sweet points. Every wave of enemies is a little longer and a little harder than the last</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to fling.</p>\n<p>Use the space key to shoot a bullet if you have enough ammo.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the maker of the Pixel Boy (the Pixel Perfect Camera):\u00a0</p>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4MDTn6WkqvBfBW_4cFZp2g<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db127afd398f9464d08efed6b381729d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AwesomeRedflare"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
