In this easygoing game, you'll play a little bird wandering in the sky, gliding on the lookout for some fresh sweets.</p>\n<p>No stress and all chill! You choose the game duration and there's no way for your little birdie to be harmed :-)</p>\n<p>The less you touch the inputs and let your character glide in the wind, the more you'll be rewarded when you catch a treat. It's up to you to find the right balance between flapping, diving, or just lingering. (To clarify, bonus score is computed based on the time elapsed since your last input).<br/></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanks to the extra 24 hours, I managed to update the assets and even add some music! Yay!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f7267efa5e9671018738c349477a193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marian-m12l"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
