The climate is decaying rapidly, and it's not getting any better. Time to abandon this planet and escape the endless winters.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you control a colony of survivors and help them endure\u00a0by choosing from one of three\u00a0cards every turn. These allow you to place improvements, which will help you produce the food you need to survive, and the gold you need to do research. Research allows you to choose from better cards, and eventually, place down rocket parts. Assemble all three rocket parts, load them up with the required food and fuel, and leave this doomed planet behind.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>3 difficulty settings</li><li>33 cards\u00a0divided over 5 tiers<br/>\n</li><li>Procedural map generation</li><li>An endless mode in case you do want to stay on Earth</li><li>Maybe frogs?</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Sprites, game design and programming by Neopolis.
