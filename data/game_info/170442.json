They have pulled the alarm but are not responding to our calls. According to the last data, the ship seems to have suffered serious damage from unknown source.<br/><br/>Your job is to report the general situation of the ship, rescue any living member of our staff and if possible identify the source of the problem and eliminate it.<br/><br/>The cargo ship is mainly occupied by robots. They are used to collect resources too toxic for living beings. You have to make sure they are harmless because they could have been easily hacked due to their weak level of protection.<br/><br/>Considering the isolation of the area and our lack of information on the current situation, we ranked this mission as a \u00ab High Risk \u00bb.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll receive:<br/>1500 credits for a full report, +100 per life saved<br/>and a bonus depending on the nature of the danger.</p>\n<p>Good hunt.</p>\n\n<p>F\u00e9lix Belthoise (Azathothep) : Game Design &amp; Music</p>\n<p>Hamish\u00a0 Bryant (Am Shaegar) : Graphic Design &amp; Game Design</p>\n<p>Agathe Loubi\u00e8re (Agathe) : Graphic Design</p>\n<p>S\u00e9verin Michaut (Batagogo) : Programming</p>\n<p>Alexandra Rogova (ASoftBoy) : Game Design &amp; Programming</p>\n<p>Adam Vaucoret (Drago) : Game Design</p>\n<p>Th\u00e9o Verpillat (UnBonJusDeFruits) : Graphic Design &amp; Music</p>\n<p>Baptisteq : Sound Design<br/></p>\n<p>With the help of: Horace Ribout (Horace_As_A_Dino)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d5945ccba54829b409cd1550918bf059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Azathothep"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
