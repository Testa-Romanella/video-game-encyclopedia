A faithful depiction of the myth of Sisyphus.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>To win, Sisyphus AND the boulder have to be in the goal at the same time!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Can be played mouse-only. Additional optional keys are 'B' for the shop and 'space' and 'W' for jumping (mouse control for jumping is clicking on Sisyphus. Should not be necessary, but he does get stuck sometimes).<br/></p>\n<p>I thought making a game that's straight up impossible to complete isn't fun, so I searched for inspiration in idioms, myths and the like. This is the final result after two scrapped project starts during the jam - it's complete mayhem and not very balanced, but hopefully somewhat funny.<br/></p>\n<p>Gold does not actually prevent you from doing anything, I figured it was more fun to just do whatever you want and watch the mayhem unfold. If you still want to try to play it in a \"more sensible\" way (?), there's a \"!\" added after the text if you ever reached negative gold, so you can manually try to stay above 0.</p>\n<p>Thanks to friends and family for inspiration! Additionally, credits to Wiz-sama for the title.</p>\n<p>Sounds are taken from the GDC sound packs, music is the public domain Wikimedia upload of Gustav Holst's \"Mars, Bringer of War\".<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc2a872bd7c6e99f1d8feae930ccfce1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cubehero"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
