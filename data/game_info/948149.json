{"id": 948149, "slug": "world-turtles", "name": "World Turtles", "name_original": "World Turtles", "description": "The Turtle beckons! You have been selected by a tribe of peace-loving Meeps to save the life of their World Turtle, a giant space reptile carrying the entire world as they know it on its back. Establish a new way for Meeps to survive and create a sustainable society... All the while feeding the great World Turtle to ensure that it doesn't perish along its endless way. <br/><br/>Cooperation, not conquest, will be necessary for success when the Turtle wanders into the more treacherous stretches of space or - perhaps - meets others of its kind\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>World Turtles is a wholesome colony builder with the primary goal of sustainability. The Meeps are eager to work, enthusiastic like no other, and unfortunately, exceptionally disorganized without leadership.<br/><br/>That's where you come in. Build up the Meepvilization from a small village in one corner of the turtleback to a sprawling colony that has mastered the challenges of living on the literal back of a spacefaring reptile.<br/><br/>You'll have to explore across the turtleback, unite the Meep tribes, and research new forms of economic sustainability. No two playthroughs will be the same thanks to procedural generation of the turtle and the universe it flies through. But once the turtleback knows world peace and the hungry, hungry turtle is safe\u2026 it's time to launch the Meeps Space Program!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Once full and healthy, the World Turtle can take the Meeps\u2019 world wherever they want. But while space is full of opportunity, there is also danger! Sectors can impact life on the turtleback - alter the climate, water levels, or unleash (un)natural catastrophes. Prepare the Meeps adequately and help them survive the journey of a lifetime.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>World Turtles is a labor of love by a solo developer from South Africa who has always wanted to create for others. The concept of World Turtles deserves to be developed further, together with an enthusiastic community. Join the Early Access, hop onto the back, and take part in this curious intergalactic tale!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T02:57:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b9e77872dc33accfaa56454ca3b369.jpg", "website": "https://www.worldturtles.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 464, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Re: cOg Mission"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
