Recyclables are created around the themes that people generally experience when growing up; from memes to games to apps, whether they be old or new. Recyclables gameplay is very similar to Mario Party, in which there is a central board game aspect in which players need to strategize and position themselves. On the other hand, after every round on the board game, a random thematic minigame is played, each resembling to some extent a forgotten game of the past. At the end of every few turns, the player with the least points will be permanently deleted from the recycling bin. Will you be recycled once more, or will you escape the recycling bin. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae8900d9a4356dd75c9f20b7589cffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamingoeZpZ", "SmoonthyTMG", "SmoonthyOT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
