{"id": 865932, "slug": "de-miedo-demo", "name": "...De Miedo (demo)", "name_original": "...De Miedo (demo)", "description": "<p>This is the first official release demo of \"...De Miedo\", version 1.6.2. It's my take on a 90s-style retro FPS. My love of crunchy old software rendered shooters like Quake and Chasm: The Rift, along with low budget horror films such as Swamp Thing and From Dusk Til Dawn were the biggest inspirations for making this game. This game is an active work in progress; more updates will follow regularly, at least until a complete episode is released.<br/><br/>I've included a ReadMe file with more info, including gameplay controls, legal details and the like.<br/><br/>The game is expected to run without any issues or crashes, though there *may* be small inconsistencies or buggery, depending on your system. I've tried to stamp out anything too janky with gameplay, and I'm satisfied with it's current stability. What the game needs now is a larger and more thorough testing pool to get a clearer idea of what might be broken, in addition to finding out what just isn't interesting to look at or fun to play. <br/><br/>Currently only available for Windows and Linux. If possible, macOS will come in the future.<br/><br/>Any feedback is very welcome and immensely appreciated!<br/>Thank you so much for trying my demo! &lt;3<br/><br/>- ChotoTheBright / Jesse Luna - October 2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/754/7545b81385841de98870a52157256c7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ChotoTheBright"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
