{"id": 103275, "slug": "the-delusion-dilemna", "name": "The Delusion Dilemna", "name_original": "The Delusion Dilemna", "description": "<p>The Delusion Dilemna is a 60,000+ word twine game, where you are stuck in a maze of dreams and have to figure out what is real. Your actions in a previous world will have no effect on the current world, but each world has its own branches, so your decisions do impact what happens in each world. It has two different endings, each resulting from a decision made in the last layer, and 5 custom-made theme songs. You can talk to a number of interesting characters in the game, including Iltara (a half-succubus), Ilgerenda (Iltara's daughter), Evan Times (a research mage who attached dragon wings to himself), and Sir Raulin Wylde (my version of Don Quixote). Please run on Firefox or Chrome. It was renamed from The Dream Dilemna upon realizing that that name was taken. </p>\n<p>Hints: Iltara and Ilgerenda are in the Arthurian layer, along the main branch. Also, beware of any pills you might find. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e614bd9e23442d33a470817571e695a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Nathaniel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
