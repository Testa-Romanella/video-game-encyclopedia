In each hand. <br/><br/><strong>As a warm up.</strong> <br/><br/>Only people who are <strong>proper d@*ses</strong>, with <strong>slow cars</strong> and <strong>unattractive girlfriends</strong> do not like it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In <strong>Boet Fighter</strong>, Fourways legend and champion of all boets, <strong>Hard Eddy</strong>, must fight his way through the city\u2019s iconic boet landmarks <strong>(starting with \u201cWilliam the Boets\u201d \u2013 the jewel in the Fourways nightclubbing crown)</strong> in order to find and reclaim his binnet <strong>(read: \u201clady love interest\u201d)</strong> who has been <strong>flippin\u2019 stolen!</strong><br/><br/>Together with his main charna, <strong>Modise \u201cMod-C\u201d Cwele</strong>, he will <strong>moer</strong> the <strong>kak</strong> out of everything standing in his way. <br/><br/>With <strong>cutting-edge 2D graphics</strong>, <strong>cutting-edge cultural stereotypes</strong>, and a total lack of any sense of his own irony, he will reclaim what he <strong>believes</strong> to be his!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Boet Fighter is a joke. But it\u2019s also a very serious matter. It\u2019s poking fun. But with love. And violence. Most importantly, it\u2019s fun. And it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s also very South African, and if you don\u2019t like it, it will punch you in the face.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c53da68a2b451ccdcf2319aead2736.jpg", "website": "http://www.Boetfighter.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Califourways"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Califourways"], "esrb_rating": null}
