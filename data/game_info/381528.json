Most are void of significant consequences, like your choice of breakfast cereal. Others can impact significantly on your life, such as quitting your job or having children. In \u2018Luck of the Irish\u2019, your choices could cost you your life. On a seemingly \u2018normal\u2019 Halloween evening (if there is such a thing), you find yourself at the mercy of a murderous leprechaun. In order to escape his wrath and avoid a torturous death, you must channel \u2018Lady Luck\u2019 to correctly solve a series of puzzles and navigate your way out of his maze-like lair before time runs out. Your life. Your luck. Your choices.
