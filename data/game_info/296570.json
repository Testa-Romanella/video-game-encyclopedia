It is also our first time doing game dev and design at all. We decided to start with a game jam because failing faster is better.</p>\n<p>Our game is based on a platformer mechanic with some timing-puzzles. The player can only cast a single portal spell per level besides walking and jumping. The goal is to reach the crystal at the end of each level.<br/>For this very buggy version we did only 9 levels but hopefully we'll refine it and make it better.</p>\n<p><strong>Commands:<br/>Arrow keys - movements and jump<br/>Z - casts portal to the facing direction<br/>X - restart the level</strong></p>\n<p>Lots of lessons learned and definitely we had fun. We appreciate every feedback!</p>\n<p>Team<br/>TheSunda - Programmer\u00a0<br/>Shoble - Artist<br/>CrookedLemons - Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88aad518b5f568ef75b76f93dde62c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thesunda"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
