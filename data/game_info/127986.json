You start with a cell already infected, and must move your viruses to nearby cells so they produce more viruses for you. You must erradicate your adversaries, two other virus types, also playable. The AI is very simplistic, but can overrun you sometimes because of its nonpredictability.\r\n</p>Controls\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tKey\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAction\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<em>Left Click</em>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSelects a cell.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<em>Right Click</em>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMoves viruses to another cell.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1, 2,3\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tSelects a virus type (triangle, square, circle, respectively) for the movement (keep the key pressed).
