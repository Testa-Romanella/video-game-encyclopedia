The only organization dedicated to standing against and removing the pirate scum that plagues our stars. Your mission is simple, take out anything in the assigned sector. But don't be reckless, your shields and firepower draw from the same energy source.\u00a0 Return to base if you need a resupply, just make sure you have the energy to make the trip.\u00a0 Your ship will automatically absorb some of the energy drifting through space after enough enemies are destroyed.<br/>Also note you'll be paid for everything you take out and repair costs come out of your pocket.<br/>You should face little resistance when you first arrive, probably just a defensive perimeter, maybe a few turrets, and a patrol unit. But after you get through that, they'll start scrambling anything they've got to your location. Good luck and happy hunting. \"<br/><em>Galactic Vigil Command</em></p>\n\n<p>Galactic Vigil is a Twin Stick shooter where you face endless waves of space pirates. You will need to pick your shots and carefully plan out when to retreat, so you aren't stranded in enemy territory. Every hit and every shot you take, will drain your energy. But clearing waves of enemies will provide you with a bit of a boost. Also defeating enemies will grant you some funds which you can use for repairs back at the Space Station. Take note that your money is your score. When you pay for repairs, you are paying with your score.<br/></p>\n<p>This is an entry to VimJam3. <br/>The Focus of the jam is Multi-Use: Health and Ammo are one and the same. Also, the score and your money are linked as well.<br/>The Theme is, \"Turn Up the Heat\":\u00a0Which comes from the endless waves of enemies that you will face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da3d853c9bd386063b163d0c69e131d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sly-C-"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
