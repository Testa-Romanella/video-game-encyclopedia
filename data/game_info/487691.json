Unicorns and, especially, corns can\u2019t even hold a pencil, so they can\u2019t count days too. Because of that, everyone LITERALLY live for today. Well, what do you expect from creature that named their main city \u00abUnicorn-land\u00bb? That\u2019s, like, the most dumb and boring name on this fucking planet. However, this whole world mistake of gray, green and black rocks looks like unicorn\u2019s puke. Yes, all these years they\u2019ve been lying to us. Not all unicorns puke a rainbow. Only if you eat a couple of jelly beans, which are soaked in some psychoactive shit, in order to for just a little while fill gray days with paints and colors. And you know what? Just take some of these jelly beans, and don\u2019t forget, YOU ARE NOT UNICORN!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T06:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a3c65d98fdccb3b61f869b10a7fcaf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AppSlappers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
