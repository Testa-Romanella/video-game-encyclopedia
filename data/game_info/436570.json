Think of it more as a story or a toy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two modes: Watching and tickling. In the tickle mode, you move through a story at your own pace by tickling a lee in different places. As you tickle them, you increase your score. When the score hits a certain threshold, you unlock a safeword scene. In watch mode, you just click through a story. <br/></p>\n<p>Please note that this is a demo - the full version will have significantly more content! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:34:48", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TickleSimGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
