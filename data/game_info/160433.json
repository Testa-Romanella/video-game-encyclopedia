The blue background illustrates the male dominated space of a pub, whilst the\u00a0red sprites depict the threatening interactions a female must engage in during her time at work.\u00a0The cluttered space and animated subjects attempt to show how this space can threaten and\u00a0isolate females who are forced to engage in derogatory aspects of work such as glass\u00a0collecting. These jobs specifically ignore the degrading comments made by individuals in these\u00a0spaces because they \u2018come with the territory\u2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f59bde8a9aada975caa7815c2c89ee98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FACT Liverpool"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
