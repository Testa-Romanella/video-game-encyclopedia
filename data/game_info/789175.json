When she gets her wish, she gets to live the life of a human woman, all across a single year. But as the year progresses, the people closest to her notice something more and more horrifying about her. A naturally gentle creature, she can't understand why people have grown so afraid of her.</p>\n<p>Made for Seasons of RMN V, I decided to do this story because the protagonist of \"Bugaboo\" was a caterpillar and because of the theme of the event, I could think of no better way to encompass all four seasons in a single short game.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of different types of simple puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T20:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d83afdabcdf7c2305165778b19705509.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pianotm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
