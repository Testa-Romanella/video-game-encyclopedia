Which is no longer for sale! Can she find what she wants in the gigant sea of cheap merchandise that the mausoleum was turn into? (Also, Iku has no choice but to accompany her...)</p>\n<p>Gameplay wise, this is a one-stage shot'em up where you can switch characters (Iku/Tenshi).\u00a0tenshi can go through BLUE bullets unharmed, Iku can do the same with RED bullets, make sure to switch between them in order to dodge if needed!</p>\n<p>You can paralyze enemies with Iku's lightning shots, and then insta-kill them with Tenshi's sword. Doing so builds up combo, which multiplies the points you get, which in turn give you more lives.</p>\n<p>Touhou Project and all associated IP belong to ZUN.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<strong>Arrow keys</strong>Move around<strong>Z</strong>Shoot\u00a0lightning (as\u00a0Iku)<br/>Swing sword (as\u00a0Tenshi)<strong>X</strong>Switch between Iku and Tenshi<strong>Shift</strong>Focus<strong>F1</strong>Toggle fullscreen\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Lowe-e: programming</p>\n<p>Kevin Arthur (https://twitter.com/KevinArthurLS): art</p>\n<p>Doody (https://twitter.com/BakaFail): music and sound effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab6265497391590f51856fb2a7e92265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lowe-e"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
