It comes in at a whopping 811 bytes. You can change the noise density and number of iterations with the gamepad. <br/></p>\n<p>The real fun starts when you jump into the code. I have left a init page on tab 1 with the variables that drive it. But you can get some awesome results from changing the variables in the algorithm itself. There is also a sprite mode but it must be activated from the code editor.\u00a0 In the default mode (PSET) you can change the colors using TV1 and TV2 the tile value variables.<br/></p>\r\nActivating sprite mode\r\n\n<p>1. On the Init tab(1) change MAPH and MAPW to 16 or 32 depending on your preference. While here change the TV1 to 1 and the TV2 to 2 if your map size is 16 or 3 if your map size is 32.<br/></p>\n<p>2. Now head to the draw functions on tab 4 comment out the PSET line: <em>pset(j,i,tid_g[j][i])</em><strong> </strong>and un-comment the SPR line <em>spr(tid_g[j][i],j*4,i*4)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>3. Enjoy sprite mode!</em> <br/></p>\r\nsome of my favorite algorithm changes\r\n\n<p>1. In the CELLAUTO function on tab 2 near the bottom of the function at the two lines tid_g[j][k]=tv2 swap TV1 and TV2 it will make maze like structures in PSET mode.</p>\n\n<p>2. In the CELLAUTO function at the line if tid_git[y][x] == tv1 then swap the X and the Y change TV1 to TV2 you will get a diagonal mirroring and inversion effect. It works best with pset mode.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T12:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1179124ff2ec21b87a67eacf4c0bf926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MountainsideGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
