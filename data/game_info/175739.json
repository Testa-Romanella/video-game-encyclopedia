In order to bring a positive charge toward the goal (a negative charge), you must place other positive charges to repel and guide it through the level. The game placed fifth in the competition.<br/></p>\n<p>Place positive charges with the mouse; these positive charges will repel the main character, hopefully guiding him through the level in order to reach the negative charge.  Magnetic fields will also adjust your trajectory.</p>\n<p>The game features a custom-built physics engine (for the repelling charges, as well as the magnetic fields and gravity), which I am quite proud of considering it was made with GM4.3.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mouse:  Place positive charges<br/>R or SPACE:  Restart the level<br/>F4:  Switch between fullscreen and windowed modes<br/>Esc:  Exit to menu; exit game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c19a27c6c747f02712d503ac40757f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThetaGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
