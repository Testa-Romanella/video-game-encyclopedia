I start working in a company as a software developer to get some money for my future. But I feel like now is the time for me to take the path I always wanted : video games. I already touched a bit of Unity by myself (you can check the two other games on my itch.io) but I'm 100% sure I skipped basics of using the software as I should. So starting a lesson from scratch felt like a good idea. My end goal is to cross the ocean and work in this industry possibly in Canada (for my french girlfriend), so I feel like taking contact and introducing myself is one of the first steps I can do.\u00a0 You can contact me on my email tiboo13@hotmail.com if you have any questions or just want to talk :).\r\nHave a nice day.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nModifications :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Totally changed the game design =&gt; 3 levels easy to hard and explore mechanic, not waves etc...</li><li>Created the mechanic of boss fights. Changes the camera, creates a health bar on the top, and the level end when the boss is dead.</li><li>Added UI for the number of lives on the bottom left.</li><li>Changes scripts for the ennemies to suit more what I like : Since my level isn't stationnary, all enemies behaviours starts when in a certain radius of the player (better perfs).\u00a0</li><li>Added blackholes. Those attract players and ennemies inside. They die if in there. They grow bigger and bigger during the level and become more deadly the more time you take !</li></ul>\n<p>Created by Thibault Dervin (J-DaWildCat)<br/></p>\n<p>Used free assets for the bosses :\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-art-space-ship-part-1-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T20:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e121bb8a3f5ded309999f0f752842334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["J-DaWildCat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
