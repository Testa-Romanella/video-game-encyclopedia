This game is meant to promote positive mental health by presenting the player with a seemingly overwhelming\u00a0challenge, but through persistence they will improve and overcome the challenge which will hopefully\u00a0instill confidence in themselves. To fit the LOJam theme 'Healing is not linear', the player is healed for exponentially less every time they use their healing potion. Special thanks to Daniel Sottile for the music!</p>\n<p>=== Gamepad Controls ===</p>\n<p>[X] - Light Attack</p>\n<p>[Y] - Heavy Attack</p>\n<p>[LB] - Block</p>\n<p>[A] - Heal<br/></p>\n<p>[Joystick Left/Right] - Dodge<br/></p>\n\n<p>===\u00a0Keyboard Controls ===</p>\n<p>[F] - Light Attack</p>\n<p>[G] - Heavy Attack</p>\n<p>[S] - Block</p>\n<p>[H] -\u00a0Heal\r\n</p>\n<p>[A/D] - Dodge</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02f2f48541003a43f21decf908bbe427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MasonButterwick"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
