Imagine if your life was nothing more than some electronic game. <br/><br/>Imagine if you knew then what you know now. Imagine if you could replay your little life all over again.

Mess around, run away, hide out, suffer under, heal up, sell off, struggle through, knuckle down, tip over, cave in, dance on!
