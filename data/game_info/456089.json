You play as the chosen one, someone with no discernible skills who has been tasked with acquiring the arbitrary item to prevent villains from using it for unnamed nefarious purposes. Thankfully you are accompanied by a party of brave adventurers who will gladly fight all your battles for you. All design and programming was done by me in Unity using C#, none of the art or music is my own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb0ad550a3b89fea804c65bdd03ab053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel James"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
