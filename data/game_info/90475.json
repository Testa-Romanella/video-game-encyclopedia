Starting with a band of migrants you can found a settlement and grow it into a thriving city. Managing resource production, defenses, and trade, you can expand your city into\u00a0 a mighty empire.</p>\r\nCity Building\r\n<p>Cities are the foundation of your empire. The citizens must be fed and housed, and in return they can produce all the resources you'll need. Fail to meet their needs, however, and you may end up with rioters in the streets.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basics of resource production, however, you need to consider roads and defenses. Do you spend the time and resources to construct a great wall around your city? Do you rely on your soldiers alone? The streets themselves will become battlefields when you are invaded, so take care when designing them.</p>\r\nEmpire Building\r\n<p>As your city grows you can start sending some of its citizens out to create new cities. These cities can then be linked together through trade routes, spreading rare resources throughout your empire.\u00a0</p>\r\n2.5 Compatible Mods\r\n<ul><li>Merfolk Race</li></ul>\r\nUseful Resources\r\n<p>Unofficial Discord - unofficial in that I don't administer it<br/></p>\n<p>Twinning Software Website - for guides, tips, and in depth explanations</p>\n<p>Issue Tracker - for upcoming features and known bugs</p>\r\nFeature Completion\r\n<p>Bronze Age is still in heavy development, with updates planned for every two weeks (give or take).
