After obtaining a warrant from an automated database extraction system, the player is granted access to their target's Desktop in order to collect incriminating evidence to prove the target's guilt. But when the line between criminality and the everyday struggle is blurred, the player must look to their own conscience to arrest or exonerate the targets he or she is surveilling. In all, Perfect Citizen seeks to take the player on a thought provoking journey through the personal lives of imperfect people in order to push the bounds of games as a storytelling medium and create a tense yet intimate experience that directly engages with the discourse of privacy and security.<br/>Itch.io:\u00a0https://projectperfectcitizen.itch.io/project-perfect-citizen</p>\n<p>Awards<br/>Nuovo Award Honorable Mention at IGF 2017:\u00a0https://igf.com/2017<br/>Sammy Awards:\u00a0https://sammys.soe.ucsc.edu/2016/awards<br/><br/>Press<br/>Rock, Paper, Shotgun:\u00a0https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/18/free-loaders-this-desktop-is-under-investigation/<br/>Player One: https://www.player.one/project-perfect-citizen-papers-please-digital-age-553987<br/>Famitsu:\u00a0https://web.archive.org/web/20160701134041/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201606/30109681.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/7341c8c8f8b0d25d0e2491d42513db57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JasonBrisson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
