And trust me, it will be a journey to remember! It all started a few months ago\u2026<br/><br/>Sally and I were happy in her salon. Being beauticians, making girls pretty\u2026 business was booming! That all changed when her \u201cbest friend\u201d (hah!) April came around, offering Sally a \u201cchance of a lifetime\u201d. Sally, bless her, chooses only to see the good in people and actually listened to April. Next thing you know, she\u2019s sold her salon and used all her savings to become co-owner of Happyville, a luxurious spa.<br/><br/>And that\u2019s when the real chaos started\u2026 April is fixated on earning a Mirage star for the spa and is willing to do any- and everything to get one! Sally doggedly insists April isn\u2019t as bad as she looks. I\u2019m sorry, but if it looks like a snake and slithers like a snake, well\u2026 but that\u2019s just MY opinion!<br/><br/>Please come help me talk some sense into Sally. With your help, I\u2019m sure it will be okay in the end!<br/><br/>Enjoy this salon time management game brought to you by GameHouse Original Stories, the creators of the Delicious and Heart's Medicine series!<br/><br/>Try the first few levels for free.
