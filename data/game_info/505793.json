{"id": 505793, "slug": "avanti-the-joy-of-driving", "name": "AVANTI - The Joy of Driving", "name_original": "AVANTI - The Joy of Driving", "description": "Drive a kart, a racing car or a offroad car (currently only kart) on different locations (currently 10 racetracks) in first person driver view only.   Each car has his own dynamic physics, behavior and racetracks.  Complete quests like getting a good racetime or for example slalom driving (currently missing).  Complete the quest for one ractrack to unlock the next racetrack (currently missing). As further you come as more powerfull will the cars get (currently missing). Per example you start with a 25PS  kart and in the end you drive a 250PS superkart (currently missing).   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can drive the cars with keyboard (WASD or Arrow keys , R restart track , 1-9 for radio , /*-+ for volume control). Its a development focus that you can drive good with keyboard. Gamepads and steering wheel are also planned to be supported.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn moment the game is focused on singleplayer only. Multiplayer racing will maybe added later.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow the game looks finally at the end of the development is open in the moment.  There will be weekly updates while in development and you can watch the game grow.  Also any comments or sugestions in discussion section are welcome. Content can be missing, added or removed while in development.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRacetrack 5 is currently my personal favorite. Its some fun to drift around. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is being developed on a Ryzen 5 1600 processor with a AMD 570rx graphic card. <br/>\r\nThe graphic card is reduced to 50%  performance in AMD driver settings. <br/>\r\nThe 3dmark11 performance benchmark score is P9126.<br/>\r\nSo the game can run on less powerfull systems. The final requirements <br/>\r\nwill be settled when the game is finished developed, but will not exceed<br/>\r\nthe developer system.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2957152c126c16c103ab1becc51dee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandtner"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brandtner"], "esrb_rating": null}
