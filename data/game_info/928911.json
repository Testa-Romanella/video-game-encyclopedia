Make your entrance by cutting open windows, or dress up as a guard to fool your enemies. Disable cameras and subdue anyone who hears you drilling open the vault.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0VIOLENCE</strong><br/>Run and gun, stay behind cover, or even blow a hole in the wall for fast entry, that is up to you. Find the loot and get out as fast as possible, or you will need to face an aggressive police force head-on.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0CROWD CONTROL</strong><br/>Controlling civilians is a vital part of any heist.

You can even kill one of them to make a statement.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0EQUIPMENT STORE</strong><br/>The weapons store provides you with any equipment you may need, for any strategy you choose. It ranges from high power assault rifles and explosives to\u00a0silent glass cutters and cable ties.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0DYNAMIC GAMEPLAY<br/></strong>A-Star Theft is designed to accommodate your playstyle.
