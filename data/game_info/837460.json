I would set the suggested amount as $0 if I could.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a light management sim hiring a group of adventurers out of a castle. By placing furniture and showing adventurers to their rooms, you will help them level their skills. With these skill they can take on quests to help restore both your castle and the surrounding lands. In this prototype you will eliminate a bandit threat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Placing armor, weapons and training equipment in someone's room will have them automatically equip and train themselves. Just put together a party and bring them to their next quest to watch them fight. No inventory or schedule management required.</p>\n<p>The playtime is roughly 40 minutes. Please leave feedback to let me know if this prototype is something you would like to see developed into a full game.</p>\n<p>Note from the developer:\u00a0\u00a0Aside from small bug fixing, I will not be making public progress on this for a while. I like my idea of assigning npcs to a room with furniture and letting them figure themselves out from there. I might use that to make something more focused on a village economy. Before I can do that, I need to rewrite the underlying code. Unity has been more hinderance than help for this project, so I will be evaluating a few engines to decide my next move. I will then need to rewrite my code and make improvements to every part of this underlying infrastructure. Given that this prototype took 15 months, it will be at least 1 year before I have a new prototype or more completed game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:08:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c545287d48f863414b37e2ca90ebf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PumpingLemma"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
