{"id": 257151, "slug": "ags-project-demo", "name": "AGS Project Demo", "name_original": "AGS Project Demo", "description": "<p>The current build has very little functionality, however, there is some!\u00a0<br/>There are Windows and Linux builds available!</p>\n<p><strong>// For the ones of you whom wish to know what is made so you don't have to waste time playing the game to figure it out.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There is </strong>from <strong>start</strong> to <strong>finish :</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>game start</strong>s with a guy beating someone. This is not a loading screen, it's a mare attempt at an intro sequence, an ugly one but a successful one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You <strong>start</strong> in your dark <strong>apartment</strong>, as you check the hidden\u00a0door all the way to the right,\u00a0you notice it's locked. The <em>key</em> is located in your <em>inventory</em> (In which you can access by hovering your mouse at the top portion of your screen).</p>\n<p>As you <strong>leave your</strong> <strong>apartment</strong>, you see an empty hallway with a\u00a0<em>painting</em>. Looking at it will trigger a small conversation with yourself.\u00a0There is a staircase on the <em>right side of the room</em> that you may <strong>interact</strong> with to enter the <em>first floor</em>.</p>\n<p>on the <strong>first floor</strong>, there is a <em>sleeping <strong>receptionist</strong></em>.\u00a0 There is also a bottle of <em>whisky</em> and a <strong>cactus </strong>on the desk. Here is where you are given a couple of choices.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION ONE</strong> :\u00a0You may look at the <em>receptionist</em>, recalling his name might be <strong>Jim</strong>. As you do so, you may leave the room without interacting with him or the things on the desk. This effects later events as well as.</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION TWO</strong> :\u00a0You may interact with the<strong> cactus</strong> on the desk, awakening the <strong>receptionist</strong> and <em>hurting your hand</em>. The <strong>receptionist</strong> may now be spoken to. If you do so, you find out his name is <strong>Finn</strong> and he found your action unwise although respects your honesty. This effects later events cause now your hand is damaged.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION THREE</strong> :\u00a0\u00a0You may interact with the<strong> cactus</strong> and awake <strong>Jim/Finn</strong> and leave without talking to him. There is no gameplay changes from OPTION TWO other than the receptionists name is now <strong>Jim</strong> to you.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Other then the <strong>receptionist</strong>, there are two doors on the <em>first floor</em>. One has red text/scribbles on it and accesses the backside of the building.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>Backside of the building</strong> has a couple of look-ables, including a <strong>wall with tagged art</strong> on it. This wall is a little weird cause at first, you can click anywhere on the <strong>wall</strong> to get the <strong>introduction on a in-game fairy tale</strong>. After the introduction, you can <strong>click on individual parts of the wall</strong> for further information about the story.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is not much more to the game than that. There are a couple look-ables, very few interact-ables and no sound effects. The game is not a representation of the final product, this is just a test to get a game running. The finished product will probably have the same tone, art direction and gameplay but I can promise a lot of changes will happen.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-- Love Benjamin (@PandaUnwise)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/eddb62f603fd1b29f95e34db8adfcb0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PandaUnwise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
