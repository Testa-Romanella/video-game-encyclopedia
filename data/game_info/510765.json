It is a turn-based board game.\u00a0 Each turn, three randomly colored chips fall on random grids of a 9x9 squares board. Your\u00a0mission in Colorlines is to re-locate the chips (by moving one of them per turn) to form lines consisting of five or more chips of the same color. The lines can be arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each line you build immediately disappears, giving you points. There is basically no end to the game, but your first objective is to surpass the 3000 points scored by the \"king\". Once you surpass him, he loses the throne and you become the new king, but the game continues to infinitum. You lose when the entire board is filled with chips.</p>\n<p>This version of the game was written in JavaScript, and has most of the features of the original Lines.</p>\n<p>The game runs in a 400 x 600 windowed screen.</p>\n<p>Key Features of Colorlines:</p>\n<ul><li>Infinite number of levels.</li><li>No hidden data connections!</li><li>No Ads!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b40a0e125f042288e94568b3112518e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazy Mutt Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
