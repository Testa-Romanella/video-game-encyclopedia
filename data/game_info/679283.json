But there's someone important to you there, someone you know must still be alive. The question is, how much are you willing to risk in the name of friendship?</p>\n<p>This is a sequel to (and a little more serious in tone than) The Painter of Devil's Fangs. That being said, it's not really necessary to play the previous game to understand this one.</p>\n\n<p>All writing, art, and programming by me. (I almost died making this game!
