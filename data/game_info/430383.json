At first we will start by cleaning up the waste that has been scattered on the ground, or sometimes, that is flying through the air in small balloons.<br/><br/><strong>Many more things, and more to come.</strong><br/><br/>But gradually we will be asked to do more. For example, the first objects will be automatically directed to a ship, or a plane, to be taken to a recycling plant. <br/><br/>However, later on other objects will be found to be recycled. You'll need to transport those items to a recycling center, and choose the right container for the waste to be processed properly.<br/><br/>Other tasks will consist of planting trees in different areas. To do this, you will have to capture the \"tree powerup\". With them you will be able to create trees and plant them wherever you want. Also by planting these trees you will be able to obtain paper, which you will then use to change the plastic bags for paper ones, which will be a source of joy for the passers-by.<br/><br/>And many more things that will be seen throughout the different levels of the game. For example, you can even, in the advanced levels, clean the seas and see how life flourishes. You can clean up the debris floating in space around the Earth. And even travel to the future and clean up the moon before it gets too dirty.<br/><br/>All this and much more is <strong>\"Elva the Eco Dragon\"</strong>. <br/><br/>Help Elva in her dream of cleaning up the whole planet. Because we still have a chance to win. In the game, and in our lives.
