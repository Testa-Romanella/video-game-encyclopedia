Every time you use thrusters fuel is burnt, don't run out or you will crash!</p>\n<p>When landing, keep your speed below 1 m/s in all directions or you will crash!</p>\n<p><strong><em>blue pads are fuel refill, and orange pads are delivery pads.</em></strong></p>\n<p>See if you can make it to the end!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls are: arrow keys - each key is a different thruster,</strong> try em out!<br/></p>\n<p>***This is an early prototype! That means among other things, that some sound is not yet included and other visuals etc.. may change or not! Also, not much optimization has been done yet, but not bad overall(Worst I have noticed was a bit of lag when you die).\u00a0Everything tested fine for me, your experience may vary!!! ****</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1f1f1f6ccf131c85ddaf499128e0c87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HCG"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
