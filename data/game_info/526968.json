Theme was On The Fence or something so the idea is you're undecisive about what gun to use and therefore just switch to a random gun when out of ammo. My focus on this game was to better understand the process of path finding so that's why all the zombies are literally dumber than my dog. There aint much to do but it's great for a quick snippet of fun, hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>BOTH VERSIONS ARE OCULUS ONLY -\u00a0</strong><em>I believe running in revive is a thing? But never used it before so can't guarantee\u00a0anything... sorry for any inconvenience, blame Unity and Valve's political issues!\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e74386f13c3c7c46612dd69f6dfeb6bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
