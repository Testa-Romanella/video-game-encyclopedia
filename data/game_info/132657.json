You control three diferent alien units (scout, archer and knight) and your goal is to beat opponents units. The map is shrinking over time so you will run out of space if you don\u2019t finish them soon!</p>\n<p>This game is a little experiment to see if I can crunch whole weekend ;) The game is definitely overscoped for 48h jam. But I wanted to make this kind of game and I was courious if I can make it in two days. And it turned out I can! Well\u2026 barely. It\u2019s not too polished but hey, it has AI and procedural generation of maps :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you will enjoy it, AI is not very clever so it should be easy and maybe a bit funny.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d4bb3351bf90a83d457609f45acb56e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jiri Hysek"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
