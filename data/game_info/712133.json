The Editor allows you to create plots and nations, edit them, and then play on those maps.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The primary objective of the game is to conquer all the other nations. To do this, you need Units. Units can be bought for 100 coins from the plot window of a plot you own. Left click and drag to select your units, and right click to send them to a plot. If they can stand on an enemies' plot for five game ticks, you will capture the plot!</p>\n<p>To start a game, select a nation to play as. Once you've started a game, you will see you're available wealth and population. Every ten turns, you gain income based on your population and what trade good each plot contains.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fe75bb00ed7f3dff48bf68dc8b2925e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["aGoldenFly"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
