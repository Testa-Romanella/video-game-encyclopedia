A new batch of seedlings was recently planted. 7 of the 9 squares in the garden are seedlings, but two of the tiles contain deadly weeds beginning to grow that threaten to kill nearby plants every turn. Every turn, you dig up one tile. Revealing a seedling will tell you the number of weeds on adjacent squares (up, left, down, right).\u00a0Solve the puzzle by digging up all the weeds before you use up all of your digs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Spacebar to reveal a tile</p>\n\n<p>TEAM CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Bill Chen: Artist/Animator/Programmer</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/profile/puggytatoes\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Deppmeier: Programmer</p>\n\n<p>https://kdeppmeier.itch.io/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Santiago Morales: Programmer</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://aleroms.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Alejandro Johnson: Sound/Audio<br/></p>\n<p>https://alegator8.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Wesley Lin: Game Design</p>\n<p>https://w3sl.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T05:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea30598cf34f36b9a9be65e0eb5ca77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Santiago", "Puggytatoes", "w3sL"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
