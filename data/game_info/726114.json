Welcome to my first ever Itch project.</p>\n<p>I'm super excited to have finished a full project and to be able to upload it now.</p>\n<p>This project was submitted for the 41st Godot Wild Jam, and I learnt a lot through participating. I realised how quickly time can disappears when working on a game.
