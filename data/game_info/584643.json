It is called Auntie Ant. I took on a really aggressive type of game, hopefully it goes over well.</p>\n<p>You are an ant in this tiny world. Watch out for feet! Jump can be done with space, left click, or A on a controller. Moving can be left/right arrows or a and d, or the left joystick. This game is much more fun with friends, and single-player was sort of an afterthought, not even winnable technically. But when you play with frembs, you can definitely win! Be the last Aunt standing! Notice, when you destroy an enemy, that will send it randomly to a friend, and there are power-ups all over to help you get them!</p>\n<p>This game is presented intentionally without audio due to the HTML audio issues that we've been having lately. That said, if the artist and I develop this game further, we'll be adding some high-quality music and sounds.</p>\n<p>The artist is the inimitable\u00a0RageMuffin#0697 on Discord. She is amazing and invites you to her Discord at:\u00a0https://discord.gg/VkWpBwBD\u00a0(this expires in 7 days, so get in while you can!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31f0b49cb962dba6896c116fe5e6adef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["BackAt50Ft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
