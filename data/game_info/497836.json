At the end of it it would make a pattern or spell a simple message like \u201chi\u201d. He had fun doing it, so I thought it could be interesting to expand on that with a larger number grid as well as a few colors.</p>\n<p>I landed on 16x16 as you can get some pretty fun images out of that grid size.</p>\n<p>Here are a handful of puzzles\u00a0I put together. Hope to make more of these and share with others!</p>\n<p>The key to the Pixel Hunt Puzzle is <strong>take your time and enjoy the process</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: the name \u201cPixel Hunt\u201d is based on the point-and-click adventure game trope of pixel hunting. This is where you have to locate a very specific object on the screen that is so small, with no clues to where or what it is, that you\u2019re literally combing through the scene one pixel at a time to see if the mouseOver event will change. I hated those puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aae46c83c592c445859893614e5a909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Shen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
