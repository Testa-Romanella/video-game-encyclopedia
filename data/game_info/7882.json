Fight your opponents on randomly generated maps with JUST ONE SPEAR.<br/><br/>Move around the single-screen area by tapping where you want to go.

Increase your multiplier by getting kills without missing.<br/><br/>Capture the Flag makes you capture markers on the map to increase your multiplier. Hold on to them (by keeping opponents away) to avoid losing your multiplier and increase your score.<br/><br/>Death Race gives you a series of relays you have to get to before they expire. Scoring high means not missing a relay and trying to get some kills along the way.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>One Spear Arena was recently shown at Indiecade East and got fantastic response -- thanks to all those who played ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea829e3708589a3711ef33c38cbc7894.jpeg", "website": "http://game.36peas.com/onespearsavage", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["36peas"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Productivity Balloon"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
