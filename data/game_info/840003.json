This game is akin to the well known Trolley Problem. Will you let a trolley run over 5 people, or will you pull the lever to run over 1 instead. In this game however, your goal is to run over as many people as humanly possible!</p>\n<p>This game was made in exactly the 3 hour time limit. It was my first time back to game dev after a month and half break. I hope you enjoy the hilarity of it!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Up/Down Arrows -Toggle Track</p>\n<p>Space- Start and Stop Trolley</p><p>Reset Game - R</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Paper Texture -\u00a0https://www.textures.com/download/PaperCrumpled0004/14648</p>\n<p>Font - https://www.1001freefonts.com/arabella-font.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/7988e305a1f55d41ba37802f729aaa02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StraightUpGruntled"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
