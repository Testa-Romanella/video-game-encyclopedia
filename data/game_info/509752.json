Use your Fast paced striking and beat all 3 levels to save your sanity.?<br/></p>\n<p>Geometry Wars</p>\n<p>A top down shooter game developed by Kayhos Studios(Salaar Zahid,Meraal Mathar , Shayan Kazmi).We wanted to create a top down shooter game and mix it with aspects of retro cyber punk themes and an engaging story line.The prototype is fairly simple since we were working with a deadline.At the start of the project we\u00a0really wanted to develop thematic aspects of the game and managed to create an atmosphere that was cohesive with our initial vision. The game is under development we'd hope\u00a0to add more levels , and improve on the gameplay and pacing .</p>\n<p>enjoy!</p>\n<p>KayhosStudios</p>\n<p>Game Developers : Salaar Zahid,Meraal Mathar , Shayan Kazmi</p>\n<p>Game Programming :Salaar Zahid</p>\n<p>Level Design :Salaar Zahid,Meraal Mathar</p>\n<p>UI design :Shayan Kazmi</p>\n<p>Game Artist: Meraal Mathar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/71180a6e6a29cf3cd63d76a52562748e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MeraalMathar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
