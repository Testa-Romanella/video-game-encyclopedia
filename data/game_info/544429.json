It is set in a future where the galaxy is controlled by corporations that advertise wherever they can, especially in the annual Bottom Line galactic race. Players don\u2019t just win this race by the place they finished in, they win by obtaining more hype points than their competition! Players can gain Hype for the company they are representing by destroying their opponents\u2019 vehicles and having shorter lap times compared to them. The game is up to 4 player, couch co-op. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have enough players though as bots can participate in their place.</p>\n\n<p>Controller Support for macOS only available through\u00a0Xbox Controller Driver for macOS (Pre Big Sur Update)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a71ff2578c3994c21cbbf42f0f230ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["VeliProductions"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
