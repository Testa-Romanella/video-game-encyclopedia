The players take turns moving their pieces in an attempt to capture the opponent's pieces, scoring points when they do. The pieces have an intransitive relation in that certain pieces can only capture certain other pieces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my very first game and as such exists mainly as a learning experience for me. The following features are currently missing from the game, but are on my todo list:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>An AI opponent</strong>; the current playable game is for two human players</li><li><strong>Better visual polish;</strong> including a more intuitive move indicator and other in-game hints</li><li><strong>A story<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>The game is written in the Godot engine and the assets are made with Inkscape. It's currently available only in-browser, but as the format might suggest, I'm eventually targeting mobile.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/913a555a2381bf1a08ba2c7f2bcf201f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AtokNiiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
