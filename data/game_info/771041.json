It is a simple game that is suitable for players of all ages. Also, it can be entertaining to be an ice-break party game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Imagine you are on a cookie island that cookies are the essential resources. Each of you has a cookie factory. Everyone play to gain the material to make cookies. Who made cookies faster wins.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is mainly made for three players but can be more with adding cards. You can learn it in less than 3 minutes, and the mechanics are light enough so kids can take part as well. Although chance can give a significant advantage to win sometimes, having more strategy and retention can make the game more competitive. I am not telling you why this game is called Cookie Liars, but you will find out when playing.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>There are 10 kinds of material cards, 1 rainbow material which can stand for any other material, 1 Chilli card that cannot give to other players.\r\n</li><li>Each player draws 6 kinds of material from the 10 basic materials as a recipe for the factory.\r\n</li><li>Each player draws 5 cards by turns.\r\n</li><li>Player A gives 1 card to player B, draws one card from the pile. Player B and C do the same in the same order.\r\n</li><li>There can only be less than 7 cards on each player's hands. The players need to throw away 1 basic card when they have 8 cards.\r\n</li><li>Players can throw away 1 Chilli card if they have more than 2 Chilli cards.\r\n</li><li>The player who collects all the cards in the recipe first wins.\r\n</li><li>Every movement needs to be public except for each player\u2019s recipe.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Everything you need to play is included in the download. Please print and play!\r\n</p>\n<p>*If there are more than 3 players, please print more cards.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We wrote down some verbs, adjectives, and nouns on cards from brainstorming things we like and are popular these days. And we got \u201ctransportation\u201d, \u201cby the sea\u201d, \u201ccookies\u201d, \u201clie\u201d and \u201cbase\u201d by drawing cards. From those words, we came up with the foundation of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Aim to achieve in the game</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0We adjusted the cards and rules many times with playtests to achieve a suitable play speed and experience. The final design always takes more than ten rounds to have a winner.\r\n</p>\n<p>As there are many public movements, every player has their little trick to win. The players can guess others\u2019 recipes or cards by watching their behavior. And players can use cards to misguide other players.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>It is sometimes awkward at parties or other occasions when people are unfamiliar. Instead of trying hard to find a topic, the small game can be a great open to breaking the ice.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can always win by chance. We have one playtest finished in 1 round because the winner is lucky. However, the chance might only take 30% of this game. It would help if you still had a 30% strategy and 40% retention.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>It can also be a mind game for kids. As the rules are simple enough for kids to understand. And the graphic design is designed as cartoon characters. The parents can also use the cards as flashcards. It can be enjoyable for their education.\r\n</p>\n<p>We aim to let the player enjoy the game, enjoy communicating with people and enjoy using their brilliant brains.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T16:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d5cbe999f122a7e6699ef088bd30819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Han Xue"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
