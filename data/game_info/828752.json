You'll have to do with that for now. Oh, and there is a rock shortage too, so i'll make sure to increase your salary if you manage to keep rock usage down.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Press the (x) button to start the game, and the (o) button to throw the rock. The more the enemies the rock hits in a row, the higher the score. Move with the arrow buttons(arrow keys on pc)</p>\n<p>Please have a great time, and post your high score in the dedicated thread if you wish to.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T05:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6ed5caf8fbb22b32aaaba160825fa07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["khhs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
