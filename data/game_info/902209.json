I build the models of the ghosts and the level objects by my own. The textures for the surfaces (swamp ground and house) are based from texture files of \"Screaming Brain Studios\" - thank you very much. The ROM / game has no music and less details than I wanted to implement (with more than the actual objects I have the problem that the game crashes, so I had to remove some objects; maybe I can enhance it in the future).\u00a0 For more information see\u00a0https://github.com/torte00/Swamp-Hero-64.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28998db5d2165f7ff972a6a15188f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["torte00"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
