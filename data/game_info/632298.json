To mitigate this open your inventory with \"Y\". Then use the cursors to select the Homeblock and hit \"X\". You will be teleported back to the center of the world, where it should be safer.</p>\r\nPerma Death\r\n<p>Perma Death can only be disabled when you <strong>support the game by making a donation</strong>. The game can check this automatically via the itch api, but it needs permissions to access your profile.\u00a0When you change the setting, the game will do an oauth\u00a0redirect to itch so you can give the game permission to request your email address. Then a serverless function checks securely wether you made a donation. I don't store any data or keys on servers.</p>\r\n2 player co-op\r\n<p>Connect 2 gamepads to play in local co-op mode. It is also an easy way to cheat around Perma Death, but you can still both die.<br/></p>\r\nRandomised levels\r\n<p>A Hopworld is either completely unpredictable or generated from a seed. The same seed will produce the same world each time\u00a0down to the last pixel. You can enter a seed via the main menu.<br/></p>\n<p>Using a seed will not regenerate the world, when you die the world will stay the same. However your inventory will still be emptied and your maps too, unless you disable Perma Death.</p>\r\nOther facts\r\n<ul><li>The game also auto-saves, even if you haven't made a donation.</li><li>Another exception to Perma Death is when you just entered a new room. But relying on it can be tricky.</li><li>The sandbox is not procedurally generated, but is used in development to test prefabs. Feel free to look around, but it isn't very exciting.</li><li>The game stores your unique worlds in a local indexed DB in your browser, for faster loading. It shouldn't use more then 10MB. If it is somehow corrupt, you can use Clear Hopworld from the main menu. This will also wipe your inventory.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T04:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f796323419e9dcd2992b30c106741a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["supernapie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
