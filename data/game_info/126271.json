Wildfire Prevention VR is a virtual reality simulation of preventing campfires from turning into wildfires and is meant to be played on the HTC Vive. There are 4 stages in the game including <em>picking the campfire spot</em>, <em>preparing the campfire pit</em>, <em>building the campfire</em>, and <em>maintaining and extinguishing the campfire</em>. The stages are inspired by these guides from Smokey the Bear. The objective of the game is to finish the camping trip without starting a wildfire by learning about fire safety tips along the way.</p><p><strong>Tips</strong><br/></p><p>To begin the game from the menu scene, reach into the van and press the trigger button on the backside of the HTC Vive controller. </p><p>To claim one of the three sites and officially begin the game, you must touch the backpack to the tent in the desired campsite. Once that task is complete, all necessary game objects will spawn and you will be able to continue with your fire building practice. Listen to the audio cues as they will prompt you on the next steps to take.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong><br/></p><p>In order to play Wildfire Prevention VR, you must have the HTC Vive system.
