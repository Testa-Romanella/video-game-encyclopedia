Please play by full screen for best experience! This is a solo project.</p>\n<p>Lock, can be used to protect what they cherish, but also can bind others. Precious things can be protected by constraining the actions of others. The lock separates the space.\r\n</p>\n<p>Super Security uses the concept of separated Spaces and takes inspiration from the game of Go, which uses strategies to enclose and lock up enemy pieces. Superguard uses this concept, where the player uses strategies to separate the space between the thief and the treasure, using items provided by the game. And ultimately protect the treasures in the museum.\r\n</p>\n<p>From the beginning, Superguard was intended to be a 3d (Monument Valley-like) view game, with a 3d view closer to the board and much greater playability and strategy.\r\n</p>\n<p>The 2d perspective reduces the workload and increases the stability of the game. In order to improve the playability, the flow experience design was also followed in the seven levels produced. The difficulty ranges from easy to difficult. New mechanics or strategies are introduced in levels 3 and 5, giving the player new mechanics to keep the player engaged.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T15:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e5e6e2ab38a3311782c1d4464272c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["M0m0lly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
