Actually, I\u00a0started by developing my own game engine for point &amp; click puzzle games. To test it, this little game came into being.\u00a0 Obviously, the visuals and audio are\u00a0not up to the ideal level of detail and perfection.</p>\n<p>In the years since, I have written a 150,000 word novel about the Toki Ponist and the worlds that revolve around him.\u00a0Now the time is ripe to release, step by step, pieces of the novel and new episodes of this game.</p>\r\nEpisodes 1 to N\r\n<p>Each will tell a part of the tale of <em>The Toki Ponist on the Mountain</em> and the other characters in the universe. With each episode, the game engine will advance and my experience will grow, resulting in:</p>\n<ul><li>better and more elaborate (color!) drawings and animations</li><li>increasingly intricate and creative\u00a0puzzles in\u00a0more locations than before</li><li>a deeper dive into the philosophy of the Toki Ponist</li><li>a stronger grasp of Toki Pona language</li><li>hopefully better music, or at least something that can be called music</li></ul>\n<p>In the end, the game will not only be about following a\u00a0storyline but will also serve as a testament to\u00a0my growing experience and views on life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/9770f88f6a7acf7dfbede9d3ea36f0be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nullelement"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
