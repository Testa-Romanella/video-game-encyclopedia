This is my submission for the GMTK 2019 gamejam. :)<br/>The game is about a kid that is spread out in 4 alternate dimensions. To get reality together again you have to guide all 4 kids to safety. Avoid the spikes, use the arrow keys to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Only One\". I used this in the story (from 4 realities back to one) but mostly in the mechanics as you control only one character in 4 different environments / realities / dimensions. Literally; I translated it into <strong>only one input method</strong> (for 4 characters).</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think of the game^^</p>\n<p>Good luck! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6de/6ded25be4bde81302c284e9a82d574fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Catnip"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
