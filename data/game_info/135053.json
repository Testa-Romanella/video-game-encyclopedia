Your colorful ball has magnetic powers that are yours to control! Your ball can pull itself toward the colored bars then soar through the air to reach the goal.  Timing is critical in this physics based game.  Skillful use of the colored buttons may not be enough, you will need to use the Anit-Grav button for a vertical boost when you need it most!<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Scoring is simple:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>\r\n\tCollecting a gold bar: 100 pts</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tNote: Each time a gold bar is collected, your Anti-Grav Meter increases.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Here is how to play:</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPC, use the A key to attract to the magnet bars, and the Q key to repel the magnet bars. The space bar gives you a vertical anti-gravity boost which you can replenish by collecting the gold bars.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOn Android, use the bottom blue button to pull towards magnet bars, and the top button repels magnet bars. The Anti-Grav button is the big one on the right.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Development Notes:</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game has come a long way from its original form!  I think it has progressed enough to just let it be for now.
