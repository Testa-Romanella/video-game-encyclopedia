Not only do you need to defeat every mechanical opponent in front of you, but you also need to strive for visually stunning performances to please event sponsors and viewers eagerly anticipating your cool moves. Their likes and dislikes will either aid or hinder you on the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Combining elements of \"glitch art,\" \"street art,\" \"pop art,\" and other trendsetting styles creates a unique \"cyber graffiti style\" with a cutting-edge feel and visual impact.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Through the participant's lounge modification pod, you can enhance and modify your cybernetic enhancements and weapons, creating a dangerous and diverse fighting style. From event organizers to sponsors, you will have access to a vast array of freely combinable and customizable drivers to equip your cybernetic enhancements with special abilities, making you unbeatable on the field. The relics of other eliminated contestants left on the field will also be a major asset, allowing you to break through with their unfulfilled beliefs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Breaking Show offers a range of combat styles to suit your preferences, whether you prefer hit-and-run tactics, head-on defense and counterattacks, or precise finesse. The Breakers in the lounge are a diverse group with unique fighting styles, providing a variety of experiences and event performances. Intelligent machines, poised to replace soldiers, agents, and bodyguards, are also preparing for the competition with flexible cooperation, adding to the already diverse lineup and ensuring that every contestant attempting to climb to the top will be successfully blocked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the venue for Breaking Show, the temporarily closed-off streets may appear normal, but be sure to watch every step you take, even on drainage grates or manhole covers - they could become deadly traps at any moment. Of course, this is only if you can keep your focus while taking down every mechanical opponent in front of you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, are you ready to make a name for yourself as a participant in the new season? After all, \"the soul\" is watching and eagerly anticipating your arrival.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T11:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8954d478dded200f187cd7fc6ce92b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Galaxy Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flawless Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
