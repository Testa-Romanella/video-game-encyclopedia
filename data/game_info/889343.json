The funeral home is secluded, surrounded only by a dark forest and a lonely road. The door closes and she is left alone with her aunt ... or maybe not with her aunt anymore, but with a demonic creature. The demon chases the girl \u2026 or is it just trying to protect her from someone? Is this a nightmare, or is it reality?<br/></p>\n<p>The game has a creepy atmosphere and tension. The action develops quite quickly and engages players from the beginning. Players solve mild puzzles and search for various items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you all for videos, follows and\u00a0suggestions. Appreciate it.
