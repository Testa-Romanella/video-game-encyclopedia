I'm a huge BSG fan, and I just really wanted to see the inside of a viper cockpit in VR. So I basically really built this as my own personal BSG playground. But since I'm enjoying it, I felt I might as well share it with others. <br/><br/>I aimed at getting the flight model/physics to feel like it does in the show, not necessarily how it would actually work. In short: when you push the throttle, you lose momentum in the other directions, so you'll only move forward (think of it as stabilizing thrusters). When you throttle down, you'll keep going in the same direction you were going in. So you can go forward, set throttle to 0 and flip the viper around to get a shot off at your pursuers. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T08:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a12e1f038bc91bebe85c8c38fcdda27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FineChinaGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
