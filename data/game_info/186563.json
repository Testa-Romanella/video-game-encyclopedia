This challenge should keep the player in the flow channel for as long as possible.\r\nThe longer the player survives, the harder the game becomes. Players should be rewarded for their continual progress with points or resources to aid further play. Players should be able to assess their achievement via an on- screen variable(s).\r\n<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Serve customers who arrive faster and faster</li><li>Give customers the food and drinks they want by looking at their list and picking-up the correct food or drink\r\n- Replenish food when it runs out - warning, this takes time, so don't waste food for no reason!</li><li>Watch out for customers getting angry - if one of them gets too angry, it's game over for you!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Making the Game</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>I spend 3 days a week working in a lovely sushi shop - why not make a game of it?\r\nFor this game I wanted to make a very visually simple game with, once again, layered challenge. <br/></p>\n<p>I focused on creating a smooth learning curve and a rising difficulty that did not feel immediately (or unfairly) punishing. I also chose to make difficulty hinge on more than one mechanic (customer arrival, customer anger meter, shopping list length); this allows players to learn over several playthroughs and refine their strategy (make drinks first, ensure food is replenished immediately, etc.).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f37a3b491f83d3aa735b4a11b99d393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pauline Martyn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
