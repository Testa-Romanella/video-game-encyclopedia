And sometimes you just want to shoot some UFOs and cows and stuff.</p>\n<p>This game is modeled\u00a0<em>roughly</em> off of the screen resolution of the Game Boy, and uses an inverted version of the device's palette . Fun fact is that the game doesn't use any external assets! All sound, visuals, and animations\u00a0are part of the code and rendered in real-time, making the zipped version of the game weigh it at 33K which I think would actually fit on some of the larger game boy carts!</p>\n<p>PS. Sorry Firefox users, this game performs terribly for you. I'm trying to figure out a solution for it and I'll release an update if I do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T04:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c4/8c4708ca7441bc0f63109c1332422a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sandcat1907"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
