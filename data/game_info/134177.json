{"id": 134177, "slug": "i-am-smiley", "name": "i am smiley", "name_original": "i am smiley", "description": "<p>\"i am smiley\" is a game project developed in two weeks as an entry for the International Game Concept Challenge (IGCC 2017) held in\u00a0September 2017 at Trident College in Nagoya, Japan.</p>\n<p>The player controls a rogue AI on the run and\u00a0 has to solve puzzles by possessing different kinds of robots with varying abilities, all the while avoiding being detected by the guards.</p>\n<p>The team behind the project consists of five students from around the world, all of whom traveled to Japan to participate in the game jam. The visual side of the game was handled by Sam, our Australian graphics artist, who focused mostly on the 3D assets, and Kelly, our Singaporean graphics artist, who in turn created the 2D assets. In addition to the graphics assets, they also did the level designing of the game together. The programming of the project was done by me, Juho, the Finnish programmer and the two Japanese programmers,\u00a0Shota and Syunpei.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game actually ended up winning the gold award of the\u00a0IGCC 2017.\u00a0While we were extremely happy with what we had created, we decided to use couple of extra days to polish the game after the jam to a more presentable state. The \"FinalJam\" build is the one\u00a0we presented at the end of the jam, and represents what we were able to complete within the two weeks of the jam's duration. The \"PostJam\" build is the actual \"final\" build of the game, and while it still has some rough edges, it's\u00a0the one we're happy enough likely not to develop any further. The biggest differences between the two builds, are the addition of sound effects and post processing, as well as some minor fixes and tweaks to the gameplay / puzzles within the game.</p>\n<p>The game was created using the Unity\u00a03D engine and runs on\u00a0Windows computers.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD for movement, hold left shift to move faster, hold middle mouse button and move the mouse to rotate the\u00a0camera,\u00a0mouse wheel for camera zoom, space to use ability\u00a0on some characters, left mouse click on possessable robots to swap active character.</p>\r\nTLDR:\r\n<p>A game developed in two weeks\u00a0for IGCC 2017 by an international team of five students. The game ended up winning the game jam gold award. \"FinalJam\" build is the final official build participating in the jam, while \"PostJam\" build is a more polished version of the game.</p>\r\nAudio credits:\r\n<p>\"Marty Gots a Plan\", Mischief Maker\", \"Run Amok\" and \"Local Forecast - Elevator\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>\"Elevator Bell Ring Sound Effect\" by SoundEffectsFactory (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amNvDULdNk8)\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Elevator Door Open / Close Sound Effect\" by SOUND and IMAGE FX (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hw12rmrdg)\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Woosh\" from\u00a0http://soundbible.com/</p>\n<p>\"Windows XP Shutdown\" from\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb2jGy76v0Y\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Jazz Piano\" from\u00a0https://www.dl-sounds.com/royalty-free/jazz-piano/</p>\n<p>All audio used is licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c9/1c9f2e726cebe5ca5d22fd7741228130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taikatassu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
