Repel an attack by arming the crew, hitting pirates and throwing objects at them. You can move members of the crew across the deck, save them from water and put back on the ship. Make sure that at least one member of the crew is standing on a deck; otherwise pirates will steal the ship. <br/>You can choose from 3 difficulty levels, each of them features 4 ships that are unlocked one by one. Your personal achievements are listed in a table of records. <br/>Use different tactics on different ships. Each member of the crew has their own personality and acts differently (read more on tutorial), so you have to find the most suitable position and weapon for captain, bosun and chef, which differ from level to level. Deck space depends on kind of ship, and on each level there are different types of pirates (read more on tutorial), and each type should be fought using special strategy and the most efficient weapons.<br/>Feel the atmosphere of a severe battle and help good guys to win. <br/><br/>** use your index finger to play the game, it should help<br/>** one sailor with pan hardy can bet the pirate, try to regroup your forces<br/>** you can move not only sailors, but also weapons<br/>** first level on easy mode should take a couple of minutes to pass<br/>** second level is a bit harder, because of drunken pirates, but it should take a couple of minutes to pass, after some practice<br/>** all your comments and support are very essential to us, after a week we are planing first update, which will fix major bugs and misbalance", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f3c2202650349aeb420ce71b103a1b_TKiE49Q.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexey Volovik", "Aleksejs Voloviks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["ALEKSEJS VOLOVIKS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
