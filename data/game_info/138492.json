Fun with a few friends!</p>\n\n<p>User Known's Fight Field started as a silly inside joke about PUBG clones (please don't sue me), but evolved into a fun project I worked on from time to time over the past five months. Now, I think it's finished enough to open up for testing by some people other than just my close friends!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>WASD to move<br/>Left mouse to shoot<br/>R to reload<br/>E to interact<br/>ESC to leave / quit<br/><br/>The artwork is all done by my good friend tWed:</p>\n<p>https://steamcommunity.com/id/twed/</p>\n<p>Coding done by me!</p>\n<p>http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkiZzal/</p>\n<p>None of the sounds are mine</p>\n<p><strong>You need to open a separate instance of the game and click Create Server, then open the game again\u00a0to play.
