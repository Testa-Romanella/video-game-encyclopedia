This game was made in 2 weeks for the\u00a0Mech Jam 3. Enjoy!</p>\r\nUpdate\r\n<ul><li><strong>V0.3.0 Latest [07/24/22]:</strong> This version introduces a number of UI and AI fixes. Also features some improvements to the character controllers.</li><li><strong>V0.1.9 [07/22/22]:</strong> Original release.</li></ul>\r\nIntro\r\n<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the ultimate test of strength, speed, and instinct. The year is 2357, wars are fought and won by Mecha pilots called <strong>ONIs</strong>. To be an <strong>ONI </strong>you must be fierce and fearless in the face of danger like a demon.</p>\n<p>Choose amongst <strong>Three </strong>of the most powerful warriors in the solar system!</p>\n\n<p>Battle to the death across <strong>Four</strong> different arenas built for champions!</p>\n\n<p>Battle to the very end by throwing devastating attacks at your enemy to deplete their health before they do the same to you. You will have to block, dodge, and counter your opponent to win in this battle.</p>\r\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Attack your opponent and block their incoming attacks to reduce the opponent's health to 0. You must do this before the timer runs out otherwise the player with the most health left wins. Face off against a CPU opponent or challenge your friends.</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game Design, Programming, Art &amp; Animation\u00a0by Alex Lazea</p>\n<p>Testing and Voice Acting\u00a0by Sammantha Scardino</p>\n<p>Music by <strong>&lt;color=\"blue\"&gt;Audionautix.com&lt;/color=\"blue\"&gt;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Special Thanks To</p>\n<p>Nicolas Form for TMP Hyperlink Support<strong>&lt;color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;/color=\"blue\"&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Custom font from imagex<strong>&lt;color=\"blue\"&gt;&lt;/color=\"blue\"&gt;</strong></p>\r\nKnown Issues and Missing Features\r\n<p>Due to to the tight two week deadline, there was no time to implment and fix everything.
