When drawing pay attention to what else is on the card: Sure, it's easy to draw a \"tree\", but can you get everyone to guess \"tree\" and\u00a0<strong><em>not</em></strong>\u00a0\"cloud\", \"broccoli\", \"leaf\", or \"shrub\"? You earn point drawing by how fast others guess and how many people get it right.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To earn points guessing you need to be fast! The quicker you get it right the more points you earn.\r\n</p>\n<p>Don't just play one game! Your score builds the more games you play and streaks you win. Plus there are lots of achievements to earn while you play!\r\n</p>\r\nGive Feedback &amp; Submit Puzzles!\r\n<p><strong>Depict is in early access and we'd love your feedback!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Join us on Discord\u00a0to contribute words &amp; puzzles for the game, let us know what features you'd like to see, vote on upcoming features, view livestreams of us creating the game, and more.</p>\r\nWhy Pixel Art???\r\n\r\n<p>We love retro games, but that's not only why Depict is pixely. The game plays best when everyone is drawing and guessing quickly. Keeping the drawings pixely makes the drawer not care as much about what they draw just as long as it conveys the idea. A single blue pixel has won many a \"river\" puzzle!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Plus, anyone can draw in pixels. It's fun and easy to draw and doesn't matter if you're a 5 year old playing their first drawing game, or a master painter.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Also, by using pixels players can easily customize or draw emotes! We know from Depict v1 emotes are hugely popular and we love seeing the creativity of our players through their emotes!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nRoadMap\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Currently Depict is in heavy development as we sprint toward a release. We feel that the core gameplay is ironed out and we're ready to start letting other people play the game, join the community, and start providing feedback.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We'll be releasing builds onto this page (and also through the Apple and Android stores. Eventually we'll be bringing it to Steam as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Join us on our Discord\u00a0\u00a0to contribute words, help moderate other players, let us know what features you'd like to see, vote on upcoming features, view livestreams of us creating the game, and more.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nA Makeshift History\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is not our first game. In fact, this isn't our release of Depict even (check out our original promo video from 2010)!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We used to be known as MakeShift Games and we had a couple hits on iOS early on. We love our new name and we're making great things. Follow us on Itch (@supernormalgames) and over on our website (SuperNormalGames.com) to get updates.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For this new version of Depict we\u2019re devoted to bringing it to multiple platforms to widen the audience, adding functionality to better engage and expand the community, and improving the design of the game significantly to make the good parts even better.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We know people love this game. We know people become enamored with it \u2013 creating fan art, spending hours at a time playing it, and using it to bond with the community as well as friends and family. It's a fantastic game that's fun to play that we think will be even more popular this release!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bffbf4b035c68f24d201bf01e3215ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SuperNormal Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
