I added levels 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p>2) I added multiple additional levels and tied them in to create a logical progression in my game. For example, in level 3 I added 1 basic tough walking enemy and 1 basic static enemy. In level 4 I kept everything from level 3, but added 1 green key pickup and 1 green door. In level 5 I kept everything from level 4, but added 1 extra life pickup and 1 basic static enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) I modified the out of game menus in a few different ways. I changed the main menu UI backdrop color to yellow, I changed the colors of the main menu buttons, I changed the background planet color to green, and I renamed the game to \"Super Space Bros\".</p>\n<p>These are all design modifications.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Grace Semaan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T07:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92aa29e25f3601b2df53a33b775885c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gjs1025"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
