While most encyclopedias are software versions of traditional texts, Eyewitness Children&#39;s Encyclopedia breaks the mold by presenting creative 3D landscapes which transport children to virtual worlds\u2014from the rain forest to the inside of the Earth, from their backyard to deep space\u2014in which every scene and object is linked to exploring a child&#39;s natural curiosity of the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of their world. </p>\n<p>The encyclopedia is extensively cross-referenced and you can leave &quot;sticky notes&quot; on screens as you go along so you can go back to favorite sections. Far more than a collection of information, the Eyewitness Children&#39;s Encyclopedia is an absorbing interactive experience that teaches by letting children explore the world!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T03:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45be26d09bafa65b0ee896d1fc755d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DK"], "genres": ["Casual", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
