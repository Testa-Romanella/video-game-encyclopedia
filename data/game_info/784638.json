If you are an avid OMAD fan, this was made just for fun and is in no way 100% factual nor was it meant to be. Thanks for playing this jam submission.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>See attached ReadMe.pdf for details on gameplay rules and food data.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/599676cf885e1cb85768dd0275c65577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emanzi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
