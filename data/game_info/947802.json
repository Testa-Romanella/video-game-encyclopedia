A playing stone can only be moved to the last possible square in the chosen direction.</p>\n<p>2. Outside of the marked central area, the stone can be moved in an L-shape (like a knight in chess).</p>\n<p>3. The playing stone may be dragged from the full corner to the opposite corner diagonally if there is an empty square.</p>\n<p>4. The red stone is shared by both players and can be dragged by anyone.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to control the center of the board. The first player to control the center square with the crown wins.</p>\n<p>This is a classic board game based on the principles of old Roman board games. Moving the stones appropriately and combining them creates a plethora of variations and tactical situations, where just by using tempo, blocking and the cooperation of the stones with each other allows the player to work towards a winning strategy while thwarting the opponent's strategy. What is unique is the element of a common red stone that can be drawn by both players and can thus influence the tactics on both sides. The red stone can help one player one time and the other the next, and its existence must be taken into account in every situation.</p>\n<p>The stones can be shuffled randomly at any stage of the game.</p>\n<p>You can choose between 3 levels of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>The game also allows play between two human opponents.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T13:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d43d3e16dc1c5933d082c70a57a851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zxretrosoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
