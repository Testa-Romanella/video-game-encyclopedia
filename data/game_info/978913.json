Time your actions such as pulling, pushing, climbing, crawling, hiding and much more to avoid danger and find Olek, Emil's father.<h3>A personal note </h3>During the midst of Covid, I remember being locked up in my apartment, playing Playdead's masterpiece INSIDE and being blown away by it's art, atmosphere and of course puzzles. After finishing it, I felt a burning inspiration to do something related, but with my personal twist. For some reason, INSIDE's dystopic world, combined with a young boy surviving all on his own, reminded me of something... I didn't know what it was at first but then I understood - It was the survival story of my grandfather, Avraham Hartzook, as a young boy surviving all alone in Europe during WW2, hiding and running from place to place to find shelter.<br/>At first, I thought I would be good at creating video games if I was good at playing them. But after a year as a \"one man band\" and being part of my finals project at Tel-Aviv University, after doing code, animation and level design my self, I understood it would take me years to create something amazing and dealing with all this alone was very hard emotionally and technically.<br/><br/>From there, I luckily and happily paired with <strong>Afik Yaari</strong> (our Producer), <strong>Or Hadir</strong> (our Animator/3D artist) and later on <strong>Nadav Litver</strong> (our Technical Director) who we not only worked together but became close friends and a first circle for learning, guidance and more important, support group when times were tough (and they were).<br/>Looking back at the creation process of Emil I can definitely say there were many decisions (game design, production, animation) that could have been done different, and yes there's always place to learn and improve. However, I think, that for our first serious game, I am so proud of us and wouldn't do anything differently if I would go through this journey again.<br/><br/>Eventually, Emil: A Hero's Journey the child of a unique mixture of almost two and a half years of sensitive-intensive question asking, the love or video games as a medium for storytelling, thorough research and entrepreneurship. As this is currently a short version of the game, I hope that in the future we will gather all together again to create more emotional-compelling games or even a full length version.<br/>I truly hope this game (and maybe this little letter of confession) has touched you in some kind of way and I hope you will all be lucky as I was to pursue your dreams actively with the support of special friends and family.<br/><br/>If you read all of this,<br/>thank you.<br/>Ohad.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T08:03:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a7f67cffb3bf8d42220e29e0fbebb2e.jpg", "website": "https://www.emilhero.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starkids Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Starkids Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
