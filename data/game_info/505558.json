Each character represents a video game category, minus the twin game streamers. There's a move where a character who represents simulation games changes it depending on the time of day it is. There are specials such as using a part of a claw machine to help you catch yourself while you control the claw. Then there's the twin streamers, who can livestream one attack from wherever they left their laptop at. The game features seven playable characters and a varied soundtrack.</p>\n\n<p>Features</p>\n<p>\u2022 Single Player<br/>\u2022 Arcade Mode<br/>\u2022 Quick Match Mode<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Minimum Requirements</p>\n<p>Desktop:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OS: Windows 8.1<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Processor: Intel Celeron CPU 1007U @ 1.5 GHz<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Memory: 500 MB RAM<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DirectX: Version 11<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Storage: 50 MB available space<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sound Card: Realtek High Definition Audio</p>\n<p>Mobile:<br/>Android 4.4 or higher<br/>32-Bit Device</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be404748fb1400842ac1ce6a8e08b02c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["jareed"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
