If you cross Extreme Epidemic, the virus will turn into a pandemic. If you reach Extreme Pandemic for 15 seconds, you lose.<br/></p>\n<p>A pandemic has happened every century for the last 700 years.\u00a0I don't want to bore you with the details but it's true. That's why the game is named 2120.</p>\n<p>To stop the epidemic from becoming worse, you will have to build walls to stop the virus from entering other territories. Then place down the quarantine symbol to get rid of the source of\u00a0the virus. After that, you place down a hospital symbol to start healing the area and turning it green. Try to keep it controlled! If it gets worse, the state will turn into uncontrolled, and then out of control!\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's basically how you play. I highly recommend you watch the tutorial.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CyT8Hq8jE<br/></p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game and I hope you will have a lot of fun playing it.
