Your programs have to fit into 32 addresses or less. Your drive is bigger (1024 bytes in 256 addresses), but by no means the end-all be-all of storage. This is all REAL SIMULATION, too. You\u2019re writing actual assembly (and by extension, bytecode) for the virtual TC-06 processor that lives in your computer. You can, in theory, make\u00a0<em>anything</em>. You have a monitor - data port 0. You can read from it and write to it. A harddrive, port 1. Read and write access. A keyboard, port 2. Even a mouse in port 3.</p>\n\n<p>You've been given an old TC-06 based home\u00a0computer and some hardware to go with it. \u00a0Your gifter gave you a goal: load a program from the included harddrive and run it. \u00a0The main actual\u00a0<em>game</em> section is a series of four levels/tutorials guiding you through some of the assembly language, up to the grand finale of writing a \"BIOS\" that will load the win screen program off the disk. \u00a0Just don't run out of space!</p>\n<p>Beyond that point, you're free to do whatever. \u00a0You can try to program something in that tiny amount of space, or if that\u2019s all a little too restrictive for you, then there\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0an Extended mode that gives you 1kB of RAM &amp; an 8kB drive, as well as a Custom mode that lets you pick pretty much every number yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7fc3898b446dd4715c07f7ef50a9de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CliffracerX"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
