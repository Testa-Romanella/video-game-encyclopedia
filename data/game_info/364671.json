{"id": 364671, "slug": "noir-syndrome-itch", "name": "Noir Syndrome (itch)", "name_original": "Noir Syndrome (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Noir Syndrome</strong> is a procedurally generated Detective Murder-Mystery with a new story every time! Featuring slick pixel art animations and a jazzy soundtrack, the player is thrown right in to a highly stylized vision of film noir. Visit locations, interrogate suspects, search for clues, and eventually solve the case before the killer escapes - or you wind up dead yourself.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li> <strong>Procedural generation:</strong> Murder mystery scenarios with a new culprit and clues each time, every play-through is unique.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Permanent choices:</strong> NPCs, interactions, death, and a slew of other features will all persist until a new game is started. Every action counts!\r\n</li><li> <strong>Notebook:</strong> Collect vital clues in the detective's notebook to help narrow down suspects and solve the case.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Investigation:</strong> Interact with and examine numerous objects and characters in a number of environments in the search for more information on the killer.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Countdown:</strong> Given a set number of days to solve the mystery, each area visited will decrement the time left, adding to the urgency of every case.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Freedom of choice:</strong> Attempt to solve the case, or live out your remaining time doing as you please - be it fighting the law, going after gang members, or just seeing the city.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Gunplay:</strong> Combat is generally to be avoided as a single bullet will take down the player. However, when necessary, the revolver is always available for use.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Badges:</strong> Complete a variety of challenges to earn unique badges which directly influence future playthroughs.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Statistics and Scores:</strong> Statistics and high scores for a wide variety of topics will persist through every game.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Costumes:</strong> Multiple unlockable costumes can be earned in game.
