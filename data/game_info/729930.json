Based on the theme of duality, this game flips between the calm and storm state. In the calm state you can take a breather, in the storm state you must rotate your ship to jump incoming waves, and fend off the Kraken with your cannon which will attempt to sink your ship. The game increases in intensity over five waves, with visual and audio effects accompanying the intense storm. <br/></p>\r\nControls: \r\n<p>Arrow Keys / Joystick - Rotate <br/></p>\n<p>Space Bar / Playstation X Button / XBox A button / - Fire Cannon <br/></p>\n\n<p>Dev Commands (Available on the Title Screen)</p>\n<p>R - Continue from the highest wave of previous run<br/></p>\n<p>2-4 - Start a game on the selected wave</p>\n<p>Dev commands will disable high score!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made with Love using the Godot Game Engine!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5f612e473a42ba58d18d740250b335c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Andrew", "NykolaR", "adamtilson", "EmberBelladonna"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
