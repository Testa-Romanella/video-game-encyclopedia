In it, the player controls a tough, no-nonsense rockstar who must stop an invasion of interdimensional aliens by punching them. To effectively counter the alien swarm, the drums must be hit in a particular order to perform effective combo moves. Our goal is to give the player a sense of catharsis through big, powerful attacks associated with satisfying hits to the drums.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21b38b32389576a13a395a9242d61555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxco", "Quincy", "henry.foley", "Kiriyugi-Champlain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
