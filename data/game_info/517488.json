But who could know that the man you were dealing with was so cruel. Being forced to work in the mines for 10 days, you must somehow pay off the loan and keep your family fed while they wait for this\u00a0misfortune to be over.</p>\n<p>Miner's Lament is a survival mining game where you look for ore during your work shifts and use whatever scraps you're left with to buy food\u00a0for\u00a0yourself and your family. Time is limited, so you must plan your paths and dig smartly to get the ore you need and come back in time every day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8ab56c94afcb45d7f441cf54524bf91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChilledJam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
