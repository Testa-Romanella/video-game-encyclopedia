For instance, you can only kill a specific enemy if\u00a0\u00a0theres 2, 4, 6, 8 etc enemies of the same kind in the room ! Then all of them die and the score increases.\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you shoot randomly on monsters you score will decrease.\r\n  </p>\n<p>So shoot wisely :)\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Game Team members\u00a0:\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Zerbinoo (dev)\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Spyci\u00a0</strong>--\u00a0Discord :\u00a0Spyci#9098 (awesome music)\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>GreenLeopardGaming\u00a0</strong>-- Discord :\u00a0GreenLeopardGaming#9148 (awesome art)\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>PapaRave\u00a0</strong>-- Discord :\u00a0PapaRave#6139\u00a0(awesome art)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Premade assets :\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/timgormly/sounds/170141/https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350874/https://freesound.org/people/fotoshop/sounds/47356/https://freesound.org/people/vmgraw/sounds/257700/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e285f49f12394a819a8badbd6046147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alon1525"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
