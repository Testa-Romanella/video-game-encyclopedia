We wanted to share our creation with the public.</p>\n<p>You play as a die and solve 10 puzzles by rotating, going through portals, and using your brain. Orient yourself in the right way to roll over the tiles in the correct direction. 10 bonus levels are also available which are designed to confuse you and can intentionally soft-lock you (be careful, you can't restart bonus levels)! Starting the levels from the beginning starts a timer. If you want to you can speedrun the game!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the game isn't bug-free (e.g. the colors sometimes change). Have fun and enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b9/1b90fb26d3302daa55df6a948d932b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Moreo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
