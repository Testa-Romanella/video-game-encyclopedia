This is my second game and it is called 60 Seconds of Paint.\u00a0If you have any feedback let me know!!!<br/></p>\n<p>60 Seconds of Paint is a 2d Top-down Shooter heavily inspired by Nuclear Throne and Minit. The player is awaken in their room where they obtain a paintball gun. They use this gun to clear out enemies in the game. The game features procedurally generated levels and fast-paced gameplay. The player has 60 seconds to clear the level before dying and when the timer runs out, time rewinds and you wake up in your room again. The more levels you clear, the harder they get.</p>\n\n<p>This was completely made during the week-long period.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun!
