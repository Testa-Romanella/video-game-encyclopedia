This is a \"This War of Mine\" like game with 2D pixel art style.  You need to manage your resources and find a way to survive on Planet Carol. <br/>You are an astronaut, crashed on Planet Carol. All you have are one pitiful kitten and Robot Hal. <br/>Can you survive here with your wisdom and courage?  <br/>Can you fix your spaceship and go find your teammates?  <br/>Will you promise you will always protect little Kitty? <br/>And, find out the truth behind this mission! <br/><br/>Most image resources come from me, an programmer. So, you know, not good-looking... but I do put my heart in it.  :)<br/><br/>This is my first game. Hope someone may like it. :)<br/><br/>Finally, I believe Science fiction is the ultimate romance for mankind!<br/><br/>\u4e2d\u6587\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u7684options\u9009\u9879\u91cc\u54e6\uff0c\u795d\u5927\u5bb6\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50~", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T08:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/361a48b5f50fa98eaee4dd3777bf33d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sensy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sensy"], "esrb_rating": null}
