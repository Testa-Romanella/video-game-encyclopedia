As you progress through the game, you slowly reveal all the pieces of the story which is much larger than it seems at a first glance.<h3>STORY</h3><br/>Inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle, the game takes place in 19th century London and follows the 2 main protagonists, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in their attempt to solve a mysterious murder. <br/><br/>Early, rainy morning. It\u2019s still pretty dark and things are going as usual in Whitechapel. This is the only part of a day when it\u2019s quiet in this area of London, as most of its residents are sound asleep. Some of them are still resting for the hard working day ahead of them, while the others just got back to their beds after the night full of alcohol and sin.<br/>The sound of silence is broken by an exhausted horse, struggling to haul a heavy coach with Sherlock and Watson inside. <br/>Shortly before that, the famous detective and his loyal companion received a telegram from inspector Lestrade of the Scotland Yard, telling them to come as soon as possible to the given address in Whitechapel, where a peculiar murder took place. <br/>As they arrive at the murder scene in the victim\u2019s house, the chief deputy informs them that the victim, a man in his 50s, was living there under the false identity. The killer, probably being aware of the victim\u2019s real identity, took all the possible measures to hide the traces that may lead to the revelation who the unfortunate man really was.<br/>On top of that, the killer left a personal letter to Sherlock and Watson on the victim\u2019s body. In the letter he calls them a fraud, expresses his superiority and challenges them to try to find out who the victim was by following subtle clues she (or he?) left them inside the house and around the neighborhood. <br/>From that moment Sherlock and Watson go separate ways and have to communicate in order to outsmart and imprison the overconfident killer, slowly revealing the true motive behind this murder.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T03:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f15d4dbc56bbb9207eec79646b03d948.jpg", "website": "https://escapepod.se", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Escape Pod"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Escape Pod"], "esrb_rating": null}
