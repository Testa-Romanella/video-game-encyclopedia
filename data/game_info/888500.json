To help with their journey, the Deity has given Name Pending multiple different abilities to give them an advantage. He now has to shoot, fight, claw, burn, and bludgeon his way to the goal given by his overseer. At the start of each pathway, Name Pending has to carefully choose which items they wish to keep or throw away to assure victory. As they complete each of the rooms, they\u2019ll start to discover a multitude of items that they can choose to take or leave that will upgrade their overall stats and abilities. If the player can kill a certain amount of one enemy type, they are rewarded with a special banner that buffs their attributes relating to that enemy type. However, they can only hold one of each type of banner. If the player happens to die, they must sacrifice a banner in exchange for another chance at life. After completing a pathway, the player meets with the boss of the path. Once defeating the boss, they are rewarded with a piece of the key required to gain access to the final area of the game where they must fight the final boss.</p>\n\n<p>The Team:\r\n</p>\n<p>Manvir Punglia: Programming and Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Andrew Oster: Programming\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Chia Lo Chen: Programing\r\n</p>\n<p>Tiago Pileci: Design and Music</p>\n<p>Wade Mayers: Art and Programming</p>\n<p>Saad Khan: Art and Design\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf396d268fbda52b202a4196c066465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
