Currently, the game just consists of his apartment, but I want to add gameplay and mechanics as I go along.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>PLEASE SUGGEST THINGS!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Anyway, I initially developed a crude prototype of this with my friend several years ago called Waluigi's Living Room,\u00a0and decided to remake it now with CoolGraphics technology which has raytracing and stuff. If you're reading this, Will, hopefully this is up to your standards.</p>\n\n<p>Also I should say all models are from\u00a0https://poly.pizza/\u00a0and yes, I\u00a0know that's a shitty half-citation, but I don't intend on monetizing this and I\u00a0forget who made all the models. Thank you modelers. You are so cool and talented and I am not.</p>\n<p>Anyway sorry if I\u00a0fucked up the copyright laws and the federal government is currently closing in on my position.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - move/strafe cause you know... it's a game</p>\n<p>mouse - look around again you know the drill</p>\n<p>mouse button - pick up objects (only certain objects are pick-uppable)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c2/2c266639856c59a9bfa1b35bcdd1d6f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Squidud Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
