Devouring an enemy's soul will give points (amount based on level) which you can use to increase the main character's attributes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b59d92f04e6ed3a6f563596c5d2170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedStrikers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
