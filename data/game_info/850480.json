Our game\u00a0features gameplay around oil\u00a0with a look and feel accurate to the original Game &amp; Watch console.<br/></p>\n<p>Refill cars that pass by your station while minding to refill your jerrycan as well! But be careful not to fuel the wrong vehicles, you could be very much surprised... Enjoy!</p>\n<p>- By Julien Aberton, Th\u00e9o Driutti, Melvin Liti\u00e8re, Paul Putegnat, Teliau Simon Troalen, T\u00e9rence Thellier and Chlo\u00e9 Vallot -</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d2730e787dc911dc52ac5b8b57cdc914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChloeVallot", "teliau.simontroalen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
