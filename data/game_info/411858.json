A 2D platformer game made with the Godot Engine!<br/><br/>Hoppy Woods was made for learning purposes, and it is my first game ever made with the Godot Engine; before, I used Unity. Hoppy Woods features snappy controls, colorful graphics, and catchy tunes that will make your little journey more enjoyable!<br/><br/>If you want to know more about my gamedev journey, follow me on Twitter @CharlExMachina!<br/><br/>Thanks to Ansimuz for his awesome Sunny Land asset packs!<br/></p>\n<p>I would also like to thank Spring for her awesome music track that was featured in the game's final level<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to give a huge shout-out to the awesome Godot community that helped me and guided me when I couldn't figure out how to implement a feature. You guys rock! You can donate to Godot here!<br/></p>\n<p>Want to see how I made this game? Check out the game's source files on GitHub! I'm by no means an expert with the Godot engine (yet!...), but I'm sure you will find something of value in the source code! \ud83e\udd73<br/><br/>Also, HUGE THANKS to Gamedev.Tv for their amazing Godot course!<br/><br/>Last but not least, if you'd like to buy me a cup of coffee (I love coffee), feel free to donate if your heart says so \u2764\ud83c\udfae<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T03:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da283c58ea64c32b3f3a7d927a6dde97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carlos E.
