You can block paths with huge, <br/><strong>fiery tornadoes</strong> that suck your opponents in the air, stun them with <strong>icy projectiles</strong> or simply hail <strong>bombs</strong> on your foes and more. <br/>There is only one goal: Destroy all of your enemys in order to win! There are absolutely no rules or forced tactics, you choose how to succeed.<br/><br/>Bombastic Cars features a <strong>splitscreen</strong> mode that supports up to four players at once, so you can play with your friends at home, like in the good <br/>old days before online games were a thing. You can, of course, also choose to play online solo (both ranked or unranked matches) or with your friends<br/>(only unranked matches).<br/><br/><strong>We've included 6 different maps that will all require a different playstyle and tactics:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> A volcanic hillside<br/></li><li> A slippry frozen lake<br/></li><li> A large harbour where you can use different jumps to gain an advantage<br/></li><li> A vast, open wintry desert where you can race at top-speed<br/></li><li> A weird, distant planet where you will need to avoid icy cristals that freeze you upon contact<br/></li><li> A loft that will have you drive around on sunbeds as if you were controlling toy cars</li></ul><br/>You can pick <strong>different cars</strong> that all have their own feel to them and thus will fit your preference. <br/>Check out the screenshots to see which cars are currently included.<br/><br/>Bombastic cars is still being developed by XOAProductions, thus players will benefit from <strong>new maps, brand new cars and weapons</strong> in the future.<br/>Also we are planning to include different variations to the gamemode like Capture the flag, Team Deathmatch or Destruction Races.
