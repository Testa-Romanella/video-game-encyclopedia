No worries, let the die make your decisions for you!\u00a0Before each wave of enemies, as well as every 10 seconds, you can roll a die to equip one of six\u00a0weapons at random, ranging from a katana, to what is essentially a mini nuke.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If a wave ever stops progressing even though there are no enemies left, press enter and then right click. This will set the enemy count to zero, which allows you to roll again and start the next wave. You can also use this for fun of course :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:06:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc7889cd3e04df33fa191eaca67c1be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArmedChair"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
