A classic combination of two popular grid games (which they won't allow me to mention here) with my own twist (Moth, Peace Bomb, Hazards).  <br/><br/>Graphics by Brandon Lehor!!<br/><br/>I taught myself programming while living on the streets.  Support programmers.  It takes hard work to make something like this happen.  24 hours + 5 years of full time study.  Your generous donation could help me buy 1/3 of a fast food meal.<br/><br/>Like one of the games this takes after, this is a great skill game that does not have a fast paced time limit (unlike the other game this takes after).  Music and sound is purposely left out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T10:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e41d971cbdded522b2e060022472397_7ctHlK4.jpg", "website": "http://www.flickbricker.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dot Trombone"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Charles Barnett"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
