If people show interest I'll continue working on it.</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>Poppet's a doll in the world's most cursed attic, compelled to look out a very specific window every night at the stars, or do all that she can to reach it. <br/></p>\n<p>One day a strange man picks her up and puts her in a box on the other side of the attic. Now she must battle the attic's denizens to reach the other side.<br/><br/><br/>Features:</p>\n<p>All levels in Poppet Quest are randomly generated. <br/></p>\n<p>Action oriented combat.</p>\n<p>A unique level/delevel mechanic to gain more power.</p>\n<p>Lots of visuals you won't believe RPG Maker MZ can do.</p>\n\n<p>Plans:</p>\n<p>More graphics to make areas more unique.</p>\n<p>More complex enemies and just more enemies in general.</p>\n<p>A more complex story... Listen they gave me a month, this is what you get in a month. ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d3/9d3fbe32d82472cc043a2c0c5aa45cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Imaginary Villain"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
