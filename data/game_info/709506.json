And thankfully for mankind, his device is in working order not a moment too soon! For somewhere in the depths of the bay, a Horde of Zombie Snails is about to attack. Now, the only thing standing between us and slow, slippery annihilation is a crazy old man and his greatest achievement.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Snail Shot Torpedo is a casual defense game. Players control DaVinci's slingshot, lobbing torpedoes at incoming waves of zombie snails. Battle through sixteen epic levels! Encounter six diabolical snail variations and four huge bosses! Defeat the evil lurking at the bottom of the bay, and save your island home from destruction!\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Design &amp; Programming</strong><br/>David J.
