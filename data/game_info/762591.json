Me too. I've heard it involves a lot of golfing and punching down on the working class.\r\nNow you too can partake\u00a0on the billionaire experience with Get These Commies Off The Green!\r\n<p>In the year 2025, you step into the shoes of Aaron McRandy: Part time oil magnate, part time amateur golf champion at the local country club. One day while he's enjoying a peaceful afternoon of his favorite past time, he watches in horror as a group of tree-hugging, communist sympathizers infiltrate the hallowed grounds of the Golf Course trying to turn it into free housing and productive organic farms that blend seamlessly with local biodiversity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>DISGUSTING!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Everyone else decided to go home and leave them be. Not you. You will not let these people gentrify your ten million dollar playground. No assault from the coastal elites, innocent deer and the structurally unemployed\u00a0will keep you away from your goals.\u00a0You're going to keep playing no matter the cost to your wallet, the city, or the planet.
