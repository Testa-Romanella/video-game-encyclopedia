Without his full reindeer team, the sleigh is too heavy to stay in the air for long.  Touch the screen to make the sleigh dive and gain speed, then use the hills to get airborne!  Unlocking reindeer increases the number of presents Santa can haul and also increases the speed of the sleigh.  Collecting candy canes activates Sugar Rush mode for an additional burst of speed.  Santa will need that extra power because he has to deliver the presents before morning or it's game over!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4efa4133219b49475329d267b9dfbdd_8xtYsvD.jpg", "website": "http://www.interplay.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Interplay Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
