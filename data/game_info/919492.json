Your job is to go through an old city server from 1987. This is where post-life souls were uploaded using old technology.\u00a0The souls need to be migrated because this is an old primitive digital server. Unfortunately, due to digital wear and tear, the souls have been split. Each soul is now split in two: one is a floating orb with a vague idea of where the other part is. The other part is human-shaped. Some of the human shapes move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Directions:</p>\n<p>You must walk up to an orb at least once, see their hint, then you can go to the human shape and press E. This will migrate both parts of a soul and upgrade your speed and jump, since the old server will be less bogged down. There are 6 orbs/6 human shapes.\u00a0If you get lost, there is an overhead map in the screenshots on this page that shows all orb locations and some human shapes.</p>\n<p>Possible Sensory Warning:</p>\n<p>This game uses bright colors against a black background. The faster your character becomes in the game, the bright lights/dark background may be a cause of concern if you have trouble with flashing lights, since by running through this city, you are effectively going to be causing the lights to appear to flash.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD: movement</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>E: Action</p>\n<p>Mouse: Camera</p>\n<p>ESC: Escape<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the $2500 NYC GameJam using a 3D model of a section of New York City, which was provided at\u00a0https://www.geopipe.ai/</p><p>The music that plays is something I made a couple years ago.</p>\n<p>Coppercube \"Do later\" Extension:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/download_extensions.html</p>\n<p>This game was worked on from January 7, 2023 - January 29, 2023.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T18:30:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87ff11d3193de48da3724c375f3a5a34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
