This is my first game Jam and i did the typicaly mistake of setting my scope for this project waay to high and now I am not fully finished. There are probably some bugs and the gameplay is only partly finished. However I didn't want to upload nothing so here is my game.</p>\n<p>You can play the game in your browser or on Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let me explain the game. You spawn in a randomly generated world and have to rejuvenate the nature there. Somewhere there is a hidden \"rejuvenation gem\", which you have to find. To help you get to your targets you have a compass, which you can use by pressing [f] it will point in the general direction of your target. After finding the gem you have to bring it to an old stone thing on top of the highest mointain (compass will help you again). After placing the gem there, you win. I did not have enough time to imlement the rejuvenation part of it (e.g. nature is very barren and or brown -ish in the beginning and fertile and green in the end). I hope that the idea behind it is enough to qualify for the jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:19:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb252c2ba9273a7417346ecdd5916f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KrasserFinne"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
