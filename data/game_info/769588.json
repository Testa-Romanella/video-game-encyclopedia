For the rest, type type.</p>\n<p>I wish I had more time to refine a lot of things, but perhaps another time. I only had 2-3 days out of the whole week to actually work on this, so I ripped a lot of the assets and movement/AI from my previous entry.</p>\n<p>All art is from the unity assetstore, more exactly from Synty Studios and Meshtint.
