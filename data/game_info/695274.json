A power  unrivaled by mortals and gods alike. However... This power is said to  lie at the top of a mystical Tower. And few who've sought it out ever  have returned to speak of their journey. Nonetheless, be it out of  bravery or foolishness, the legend of this absolute power continues to  draw warriors into these mystic woods, where the Tower which bends  reality is said to lie.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"The  Tower\" is a fairly short, story light, dungeon crawl heavy adventure.  You play as four warriors: Polina, Nicholas, Edward, and Nemun. These  four warriors seek to climb a magical and enigmatic tower hidden deep in  the woods, where a power like no other is said to rest.\r\n</p>\n<p>The  main focus of this game is exploration, combat, and strategy. Almost  the entire game takes place within this Tower, and it is filled with all  sorts of dangers and secrets! Will you be able to survive the beasts  and traps that lie within? Or will you fall like all the other warriors  who have tried before? Only time will tell...\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is a semi-remake of an earlier game of mine, called \"The Root of All Evil\".  Much like that game, it is pretty experimental in its design. I  personally am a big fan of gameplay 1st design, and I've always enjoyed  making RPGs that try to be fun first and foremost. This game does have a  story, but I think going in there's no harm in knowing that story isn't  the focus.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can play  this game in several different ways. If you speedrun, you can beat it in  about 30 minutes, but I imagine most plays will be a few hours long.  That's just the main quest, though! The game is full of secrets and  surprises, having 7 optional super bosses, and many different hidden  treasures and scenes. I want you to be able to play this game how you  want to, and if that means rushing through quickly or if that means  exploring every nook and cranny, than that's fine by me!\r\n</p>\n<p>So,  if your favorite part of Golden Sun was exploring the lighthouses and  fighting the bosses, or if your favorite moment in FF6 was delving into  the late game dungeons and fighting the hidden bosses, than this game  should be just for you!\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T07:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb1e90c0743f84839bfa1a216238abdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Titan Cartoons"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
