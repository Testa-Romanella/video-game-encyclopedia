The movement system is both a restriction and a challenge, but leads to much richer levels because of the considerations needed.</p>\n\n<p>In later levels teleportation is utilized, theses allow for hopping between sections of the map, due to the nature of the game and the intended Gameboy feel, these portals are tiles on the map which you must walk into. Like with all tiles there is no going back the way you came.</p>\n\n<p>All sprites in the game are 8x8 pixels and the game uses only four colours in total, which are all shades of green.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you download and liked playing the game donate as a showing of\u00a0appreciation for my work, weeks have gone into developement, so to get more content and updates to the game, do support a creator.
