{"id": 215911, "slug": "vr-shooting-trainer", "name": "VR Shooting Trainer", "name_original": "VR Shooting Trainer", "description": "<p>This is a tech demo for a game I am working on, I made it to test out the shooting and menu mechanics. But decided beings as it is a mini game in itself to upload it to see what people think of it, in case anyone wanted to give it a go and test their shooting skills against static enemies. The full game will have animated/moving enemies, more guns, a story and more features still being coded.</p>\n<p>The enemies in this game are Zombies, Robots, Slimes and Crabs. You can fight these enemies in a field, forest, castle dungeon, simulation chamber or a raft on the vast ocean.</p>\n<p>The tree shadows and ocean water reflections, are the two things I could not figure out how to fix. If I find a fix I will update them to make them levels look nicer, even though this is just a tech demo, I want it to be to the best standard I can make.</p>\n<p>On the main menu you have an option to change the difficulty or game set up, the game set up is the enemies you fight. The difficulty is the amount of enemies to kill, the amount of ammo you start with and how many enemies can be spawned in the scene before the game is considered over.</p>\n<p>On play you have an option to play the levels to win or to play endless mode, where there is no win condition, only get the highest score before you get over run or run out of bullets.</p>\n<p>If you get a certain amount of points of the ocean level a king crab mini boss appears.<br/></p>\n<p>The game has only been tested on one computer using a HTC vive, I don't know if it will work on oculus, as the controls are only coded for the vive. I also don't know performance on other machines. This is my first unity build, I think I built it right, but if I didn't and it doesn't work leave feedback and I will fix it ASAP. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/920ced5f56441030897ca788b93ab135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fortstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
