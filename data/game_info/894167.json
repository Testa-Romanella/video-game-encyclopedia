With your ship damaged, you can't escape its gravitational pull for long. You must dodge space debris being sucked in around you and survive until the Captain can get to you!</p>\n<p>The cutscene is skippable, just hit the Esc button and click the skip in the top corner</p>\n\n<p>Music is High Affinity made by Auvic</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There are a few known bugs, such as the timer not restarting when hitting restart in the pause menu and always playing the win screen when the timer hits zero, not allowing you to replay it. Until the next patch comes out, you can work around this by closing the game and reopening it. The cutscene can be skipped with the Esc button to make it easier for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T12:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73ddecc719828ad1f20176fa25b3a08e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PatchesYouUp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
