Once you spin the fruits, you need to keep it spinning or it's game over. You also need to keep track of the energy bar (top right hand side)\u00a0needed to spin fruits. If you use up all of your energy, it'll never regenerate.</p>\n<p>As you're spinning the fruit, a timed \"Brew Juice\" button will pop up. Click that button as soon as you see it to generate juice boxes before it disappears. You have 5 chances per level to generate many juice boxes.</p>\n<p>TO BE UPDATED: When you complete the first 5\u00a0levels, you will have more than one fruit. You will need to spin all the fruits present in each level in order to generate juice boxes.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T07:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46fae87c213abe52442255f5c685170b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mugiesshan-anand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
