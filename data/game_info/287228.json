Defenestration has happened and everyone's gone mad.</p>\n<p>A religious war has ensued.</p>\n<p>Two players challenge each other, one as the Protestant Estates, the other as the Catholic Emperor.</p>\n<p>During this board game you share one mouse in turn, to place war pieces on the field and ultimately try to dominate it.</p>\n\n<p><em>This Game was made as part of the Wizard Jam 8.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I recently updated the game, to extensively tweak the UI, add some gameplay elements and even a AI. More can be found in my devlog.</em> <em>But still, there are some loose ideas for the future: Maybe a randomized board with more ressources, or more images for the in-game-messages.<br/></em></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Idea, Writing, Code, Graphics, Design:</strong> Sebastian Stricker</p>\n<p><strong>Processed historical images by: </strong>Jacques Callot and Matth\u00e4us Merian</p>\n<p><strong>Icons:</strong> Freepik at flaticon.com</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts: </strong>David Rakowski and The League of Moveable Type at 1001fonts.com</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds: </strong>Aiwha, Bone666138, Complex Waveform, DasDeer, D W, Javilondio, Jobro, Natharra and Taira Komori at freesound.org<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music: </strong>Richard Daskas<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d81d4193454906c303ce0e161f3e420.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kammerlasse"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
