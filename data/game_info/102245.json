{"id": 102245, "slug": "a-bathroom-myth", "name": "A Bathroom Myth", "name_original": "A Bathroom Myth", "description": "<p>\"Once there was a woman's restroom that had its heart broken by the cruelty of human beings.\"<br/></p>\n<p>In the City of the Animal, the city legislature has just released an Edict restricting the use of bathrooms \"based on biological sex.\" The women's restroom on the 5th floor of a sleepy downtown skyscraper doesn't think the Edict will have any affect whatsoever on it. That is, until a young trans woman named Astrid bursts into the restroom to seek sanctuary from overzealous police. What happens next will change both of them, and perhaps the liberty of the city itself.</p>\n<p><em>A Bathroom Myth</em> is a completely text-based game--your choices might take you to the inner sanctum of the Musteline Benefactor's court, to a dreamscape where a skyscraper transforms into magical megafauna, to--yes--sentient public restrooms and competing celestial bureaucracies. But more than that, <em>A\u00a0Bathroom Myth</em> is about queer communities in which people fight to survive, and to love, and to go to the bathroom without being policed.</p>\n<p>Pay what you want--all payments will be donated to the Transgender Law Center, an organization that \"works to change law, policy and attitudes so that all people can live safely, authentically, and free from discrimination regardless of their gender identity or expression.\"\u00a0.The game page will be updated often with how much has been raised and donated to TLC.</p>\n\r\n3 main branches, 7 endings, about 45 minutes-1 hour for full playthrough.\r\n<p>\u00a0___</p>\n<p>Anya Johanna DeNiro is the author of the XYZZY award-winning interactive fiction games Solarium and Deadline Enchanter.
