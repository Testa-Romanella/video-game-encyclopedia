Rounds are quick and hectic. Jump on and avoid stacking worms, catch powerups, and shoot fireballs.</p>\n<p>Your loving mother is being a bit too eager to feed you, constantly raining worm after worm on you. Worms stack in random and interesting shapes.\u00a0Find yourself underneath one and you won't be a happy camper, however you can hop on them to gain the high ground.</p>\n<p>Along with worms, some funny looking seeds are falling from above:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Red Acorns</strong> allow you to shoot a fireball at your opponent. You are part dragon after all.</li><li><strong>Metal Acorns</strong> make you invincible. Take no damage and ignore all the falling worms. Just don't fall off the edge. You can't fly yet.</li><li><strong>Snowflakes\u00a0</strong>are falling for some reason. Catch one to freeze your opponent and slow them down.</li></ul>\n<p>Two players use the same keyboard to duel. Pause with ESC at any time during a match to check the controls.</p>\n<p>Have a great time cocka-doodle-dueling your friends and enemies. Winners at this game are statistically proven to be better at life.<strong>*</strong></p>\n<p>CREATED BY:\u00a0Ryan Kelley,\u00a0Mira Holahan,\u00a0Raihanah Siddiq</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>*</strong>Cannot be legally confirmed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c064d7d48c1b3f9f7e3db7362f2b40f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arkae"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
