The goal is to create a working FPS Based Export File Setup that fixes most of the export problems that Unreal Packages onto the Game File. Then Provide it to the Itch Community to Create More Games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Far Fixed...</p>\n<p>1- Removed Outer Wrapper from HTML5 Game which allowed us to use the built in\u00a0 Itch.io Full Screen button.\u00a0 This was a major thing to fix as it require altering the Unreal Export Files. Easy to do once you figure it out but figuring out what to change was a annoying.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>2- Remove most of the bloat from Packaging as well.</p>\n<p>3- Fixed Level Transitions Issues.</p>\n<p>4- Organized Folders better and create\u00a0a starter set of materials and assets. This Decrease file Size and is just smart design as it comes to creating Child Material Instances based on the Base Materials.</p>\n<p>Still Looking at...</p>\n<p>1- Possible ways to Lower File Size.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2- Creating in Instructions on how to Duplicate it for Others.</p>\n<p>3- Adding some Base Looping Game Sounds (Hopefully Reference from Web to Save File size)</p>\n<p>4- Looking at anything that can possibly set up to be referenced from the internet instead of Packing in File.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any Issues, Questions, Suggestions or would like a Copy of the Template Feel free to Comment below.
