A PARRY will beat a THRUST, but your foe can take advantage of your opening if they WAIT. (if you wait you will never attack).</p>\n<p>Navigate over-the-top emotions to affect the mood of the duel and predict your opponent. An angry foe will thrust more often, a fearful one will be on the defence, and one with feelings for you may be reluctant to attack.</p>\n<p>Choose dialog well matched to your swordplay (the box will highlight red on success) for a greater impact on your opponent.</p>\n\n<p>- Font -\r\n    </p>\n<p>Orange Kid -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/orange-kid.font\r\n    </p>\n\n<p>- Music -</p>\n<p>\u00a0Generated With Abundant Music https://pernyblom.github.io/abundant-music/index.html<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>-Engine-\r\n    </p>\n<p>Godot\r\n    </p>\n<p>-Artwork created in-\r\n    </p>\n<p>Aesprite https://www.aseprite.org/\r\n\r\n    </p>\n<p>-Sounds created with-\r\n    </p>\n<p>Lab Chirp http://labbed.net/software/labchirp/\r\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T13:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d8c6da04d7c26f77ba7d9a0f3ae10d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jibberwocky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
