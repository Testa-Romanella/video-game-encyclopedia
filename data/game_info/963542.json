{"id": 963542, "slug": "cavefiction", "name": "CaveFiction", "name_original": "CaveFiction", "description": "<h3>\"Cave Fiction\" is a personally developed \"game\" that I, the author, refer to as a game for convenience. However, in reality, it is a monstrous creation born from my realm of sad, arrogant, and foolish consciousness.</h3><h3>Getting back to the point, what kind of game is this exactly?</h3><br/>The game tells the story of a protagonist who repeatedly \"wakes up\" in a dream and experiences absurd and inexplicable \"strange things\" before finally returning to their room in the dream and escaping from the virtual world back to reality. <br/>\"It\" has all the elements of a normal AVG: romance, adventure, betrayal, puzzle-solving, and even some suggestive content.<br/>However, \"It\" deviates from the typical AVG formula. Its storytelling is fragmented and more personal, its plot is a fictional \"realistic\" story, and it has a cliffhanger ending.<h3>The game is divided into 4+1 chapters, and designed with multiple endings. The end of the game does not mean the complete conclusion of the story, but rather the beginning of returning to the real world and extending the consciousness in reality.</h3><br/><h3>The name of \"it\" is derived from a classic metaphor in Plato's philosophy, making it a manic modern story within a classical narrative framework. Although the story content is not very long to adapt to the fast pace of modern society, it is thick enough to support each player to find happiness.</h3>Due to the fact that the game is personally developed, I, the author, have tried my best to ensure the \"exquisiteness\" of the game's graphics. This \"exquisiteness\" may lie somewhere between modern popular aesthetics and strong personal style, even forcibly subverting the popular aesthetic.<br/>Of course, aesthetics vary from person to person, just like the poetry of Baudelaire.<br/>Every person living in modern society is like a squirrel in the city, living in the urban forest, wearing the skin of modernism over the primitive classic lifestyle.<br/>Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys it.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T05:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b198fc16e9503198df4e7af8613bec73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jiangli", "GooodMon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GooodMon"], "esrb_rating": null}
