You and your bros will stand in a line, and shoot at the same point. Keep the shape of your squad, because bullets hurt whatever they hit.<br/>The game includes 5 levels, and a secret mode. The total playing time will be 30~45 minutes.<br/>If the game feels too hard for you, you may try using the Shift key. It could still be fun!<h3>Words by the developers</h3>This game was originally a personal project made for LudumDare40, finished under 48 hours. Recently we happened to have this motivation to refine this work for fun. There isn\u2019t much content in this game. We will probably add more stuff someday when we want to. Hopefully you will enjoy it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-21T10:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/524c7ff64d9e7ea8c7772feca974f7fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alina Rodina", "Team Soda"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alina Rodina", "Team Soda"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
