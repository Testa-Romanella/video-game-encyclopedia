Overly simplified due to time constraints.</p>\n<p>The story is about young and ambitious female warrior who have a slight problem - she can't find any armor that would fit her due to her enormous proportions of the upper body part. So she sets on a quest to find the Legendary Bikini Armor said to perfectly fit anyone who wears it and giving highest protection despite it looks. And now she arrives at a remote town where legends told Bikini Armor was sold. To find out if legend was just a legend or is it really exists.</p>\n<p>In this game you can fight armored or unarmored. Armor gives you some protection but reduces your speed, jumps and attack power.\u00a0 Though without armor you die from one hit. Enemy attacks can destroy your armor.</p>\n<p>Tools used - Godot Engine, Krita<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c833b62627f272f694c62bf7366d598c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Noro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
