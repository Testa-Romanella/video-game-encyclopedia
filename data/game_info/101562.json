My first effort in lua. If you've played Undertale you know the controls. If you haven't played Undertale go play Undertale.<br/></p><p>Some unavoidable weirdness due to the framework I was using: Your inventory will always list a bunch of things called \"Testdog\" regardless of what you actually have. Select a Testdog to eat food. You start with 5 pieces of food and can collect more during the fight. You can eat it yourself to regain HP or feed it to Oilliph\u00e9ist.</p><p>There is a way to spare him.</p>Controls<p>Same as Undertale - Arrow keys, Z and X</p><p>Undertale by Toby Fox</p><p>Unitale by lvkuln</p><p>Music by Motokazu Shinoda for Soleil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8edede61b23bdb6db9080dee2ec6ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["oakreef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
