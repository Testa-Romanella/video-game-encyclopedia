The digital version is a roleplaying game for two players, either co-located, or using video conferencing software. In addition to the executable file, you will need some headphones, a writing/drawing utensil, and a surface to write on. Paper and pen will do just fine.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This project was made possible through support from the Hexagram network.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about the original project here:</p>\n<p>handsomefoxes.wordpress.com<br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in the code and assets, there is a github repository for this project here:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/jekagames/digital-ttttt</p>\n<p>I also write fairly extensively about my development process here:</p>\n<p>http://jeka.games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bc687cc4d039f849a18bbd7e3beec17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jekagames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
