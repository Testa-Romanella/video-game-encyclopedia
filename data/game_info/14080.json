You have to fight not only with your enemy but also you should take into account the external forces that can help or hurt .Custom your units as you want make them more agile, accurate, strong or healthy or recruit super mega beast warriors just attract them by golden coins. What about weapons and armor? Or you prefer that your well trained warrior will be killed by heavy armored farmer? Ok, to avoid such confuse it\u2019s necessary to equip them with some stuff. Good equipment requires resources. Some of them fall on the head from the surface other one lay in deep mines but fighting with a wooden log in the hand doesn\u2019t sounds realistic (this game is totally realistic) any way a raw must be reworked by multiple workshops of your little kingdom.Key features:<ul><li>Customizable units<br/></li><li>Brutal fights<br/></li><li>Destructible randomly generated maps<br/></li><li>Customizable palette<br/></li><li>External forces</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:32:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61e2830f6a8bdec5890785bdb375edc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 72, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ilya Gubin", "ilya_bakchar"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ilya Gubin"], "esrb_rating": null}
