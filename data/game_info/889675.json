And they rot... Once, my wife asked me if I could make a game about it.\r\n</p>\n<p>I made it!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game itself is simple. You, as a player, need to take out the chosen jar* (it will have a hearth above it). For every saved jar, you will get 1 point. But beware! You have only five seconds to move jar out of the board.\u00a0 Otherwise, it will rot and if you move it, you will lose 1 point. You can spend 5 points to heal the last rotten jar.\r\n</p>\n<p>You may encounter some bugs ;</p>\n<p>*I didn't have any jars in my asset library, so I decided to use potions.</p>\n<p>Project repository is available here.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Design and programming:\u00a0</strong>Adrian \"Kolega Literat\" Jaworek</li><li><strong>Potions:</strong> Blodyavenger</li><li><strong>Board Tiles:</strong> EDslashEM</li><li><strong>Animations:</strong> Abdulla Almheiri</li><li><strong>Sounds: </strong>Beep Yeah!</li><li><strong>Font:</strong> BSL</li><li><strong>Background: </strong>aamatnieks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T20:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0d54f5c10964a04769a03d9e474d05f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Adrian Jaworek"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
