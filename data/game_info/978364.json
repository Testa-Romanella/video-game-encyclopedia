{"id": 978364, "slug": "greebles-2", "name": "Greebles", "name_original": "Greebles", "description": "Greebles is an action packed game of skill involving bulldozers, cockroaches and fish. Players attempt to navigate a maze of blocks while crushing Greebles to gain points. The more Greebles you crush, the more points you get! Just don't let them touch you!<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li> 100 different levels with unique blocks, greebles, and specials. <br/></li><li> Local PvP or Co-op with up to 4 players.<br/></li><li> Multiplayer matches with up to 36 players.<br/></li><li> 3 difficulty levels.</li></ul><h3>How to Play</h3><br/>Push blocks to send them sliding, time it right to scoop up greebles and crush them:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Push a block that can't move to crush it. Some blocks grant buffs to the player, like speed:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Be careful though, different types of blocks behave differently than regular blocks. Grenade blocks explode, pushing adjacent blocks and killing adjacent players or greebles:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bounce blocks prevent blocks from stopping when they otherwise would, and generator blocks can't be pushed, but periodically spawn new greebles:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some generators can be crushed, others can only be destroyed by surrounding them with blocks.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses to the next level when all greebles and greeble generators have been destroyed. <br/><br/>There are many other types of blocks, here are just a few:<br/><br/><ul><li> Shield - protects you from greebles and sliding blocks.<br/></li><li> Freeze - slows other players, and stops greebles in their tracks.<br/></li><li> Bonus - crush these for extra points.<br/></li><li> Fireball - grants the ability to launch grenade blocks.<br/></li><li> Death Touch - protects you from greebles, and kills anything you touch.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><br/>While fun to play solo, Greebles becomes much more fun with friends. Up to 4 players can play (PvP or co-op) on a single machine, although it can get a bit crowded around the keyboard! Up to 9 machines (any platform) can connect for LAN play, for a total limit of 36 players per match!<br/><br/><br/>Available natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Greebles intends to be an exact replica of the original game released in 1997.
