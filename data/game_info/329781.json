Use the space bar to slow down and show your heart. Avoid the tear drops and the\u00a0 sadness to stop yourself from crying, or run into them if you need to. Do whatever will make you feel better!

My name is April, and this is my first game! The game itself is very short since I wanted its development to be a learning experience. Regardless, I hope you like it!
