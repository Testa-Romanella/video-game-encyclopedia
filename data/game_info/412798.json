You can play it safe by throwing small amounts of firewood onto the fire, or you can take a riskier strategy by trying to gather a lot of pieces of firewood and throw them in all at once.\u00a0Extra fuel gets converted into big points! Of course, in the full game, higher scores will get you better rewards!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/368b1901c9ea348c7f3066fcf18f1e98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Flaky Htf Fan //A.O.C"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
