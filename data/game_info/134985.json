A charming Incremental Survival game made in 5 days for the 2018's Crypto Game Jam. You must mine bitcoins to buy and upgrade itens in order to survive as long as you can! All assets original made by me. Come play.<br/></p>DEVLOG: V.2.5\r\n<p>I will be giving you a tiny glimpse of the visual changes I'm doing in the game. It's been a hard work, but I'm loving to do it.</p>\n<p>Now it matters where you look for items. In the image of buildings you will find more tools. The house's one, food. The street full of grass, seeds. And the mall's street, guns.</p>\n<p>Two glitches have been fixed. Now the chart won't generate extreme values for the bitcoin, so we'll be having more \"realistic\" values showing up, that will also make the game a bit harder. And a glitch that would allow players to go to the city without the \"food penalty\", I believe to have solved this too.</p>\n<p>- It's mobile compatible!</p>\n<p>IF YOU LIKED THE GAME, PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO SHARE AND RATE IT! That would help me a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/608b679543a2763565326967f3bb59ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Old Mohave Games Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
