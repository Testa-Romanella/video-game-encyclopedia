The theme was \"Opposites,\" so this game holds a mirror to the Yogscast YouTube series \"Shadow of Israphel\". It casts the player as Israphel, the titular villain, and pits them \u00a0against the heroes, Xephos and Honeydew.</p>\n<p>The land of MineCraftia was a peaceful place, until the arrival of Xephos , Honeydew, and the rest of the Yogs. They tore the natural landscape asunder to build themselves a gigantic Jaffa Cake factory. But the locals aren't happy, and now it's time for them to strike back. As Sir Israphel, the mightiest warrior in the land, you must scale the Jaffa Tower and defeat the invaders once and for all.</p>\n<p>The game takes inspiration from Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books such as the Fighting Fantasy series, and also from old school adventure games like Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion. Collect objects, roll dice, and solve puzzles in your journey to the top of the tower.<br/></p>\n<p>A retro game about retro YogsCast stuff.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926965efa2dacfa1c0d1b1236b9372d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ninjaconor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
