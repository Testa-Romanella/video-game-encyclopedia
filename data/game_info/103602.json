Drawing inspiration from games such as the Impressions series, the Settlers series, Railroad Tycoon, Factorio, and more.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is written completely in javascript using SVG in React for a graphical game engine. The game is written from the ground up in a functional style of programming using immutable data objects for every piece of game state. This allows for some mechanics like rewinding, fast-forwarding, and other stuff to be explored.</p>\n<p>This is a solo project I have been working on for quite some time. Distor has been reworked from the ground up a couple of times, but I feel it now might be finally heading in a direction which shows some of its potential, inspiring me to start sharing it publicly.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/856/8565487881f7668f1a2a135f540f6c9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["larixk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
