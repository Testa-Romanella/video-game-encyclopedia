But he is only powerful when he hasn't lost his head(literally). This is a game about a robot with a very unstable head. Which is most of the times Unavailble (Intentional\u00a0Spelling Mistake)</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance\u00a0for playing!</p>\n<p>How to play:<br/>Press Z to attack, Space to dodge. Be wary of your stability bar; your head will fall off once it depletes! Kick your head towards hostile enemies to recharge stamina and gain back your head.</p>\n<p>Artist:</p>\n<p>TarMunt</p>\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>FireBlaze236</p>\n<p>spiritinchains</p>\n<p>Open Assets used:<br/>https://ansimuz.itch.io/explosion-animations-pack<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects from:<br/>https://freesound.org/<br/>https://opengameart.org/<br/></p>\n<p>***zip archive contains Linux Build (NOT TESTED)</p>\n<p>Html5 Build :\u00a0head_unavailble (gotm.io)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:36:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e307bbe4f9ab5072140e1aa2801979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tarmunt", "FireBlaze236", "spiritinchains"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
