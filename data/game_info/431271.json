Didn't you must go home ? The answer is YES! So here you go - go home and keept the princess alive. <br/>It is like all lovely \"escort\" missions in other games where people follow you and you must bring them safety at home.</p>\n<p>The difference: you have a shared health bar. If you or the princess gonna be hit you loose energy. <br/>If you shoot an enemy take care of the lifebar (you can shoot him max 2 times). Don't kill him.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/bee7386703973513ee6f05bee6cfbf15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nerdvision"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
