{"id": 979112, "slug": "beach-club-simulator", "name": "Beach Club Simulator", "name_original": "Beach Club Simulator", "description": "\"Beach Club Simulator\" is an exciting open-world simulation game where players manage a beach club. In the game, you construct, operate, and develop a beach club located next to a beautiful beach. However, the game is not limited to just the beach club; it also offers the opportunity to explore and complete missions in other areas of the island.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game begins with a character named Kevin Mathews coming to Nevermind Island to find a job. Kevin initially settles in a campsite and seeks solutions to meet his basic needs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to building your beach club, you can interact with other important buildings on the island. You'll encounter different tasks such as driver training at the driving school and assisting with municipal services at the town hall. There are also a hotel, hospital, and other commercial establishments on the island.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCompleting missions adds richness and diversity to the game. By interacting with people, you can elevate your career, and career points can later be used for improvements. You can also hire staff for your beach club. Efforts are made to meet guests' needs, organize the beach area, and host fun events.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBeach Club is also a life simulation game. Among your goals is to buy better homes and vehicles. If you're not using your old car, you can even rent it as a taxi, and similarly, you can rent out your homes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne notable detail in Beach Club Simulator is the emotions the game evokes. We worked hard to create a refreshing, relaxing, and enjoyable gaming experience. For example, you'll see people dancing wildly as the sun sets; sometimes, you might forget you're playing a game and just enjoy the atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Toilet Management Simulator\" is our previous game, and Beach Club is, in fact, a sequel to it. All the characters you encounter at the camp are reimagined versions of characters who went on vacation at the end of Toilet Management Simulator.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe goal of the game is to expand and improve your beach club, turning it into a profitable business. Beach Club Simulator offers an enjoyable experience with impressive graphics, detailed management options, and a rich game content. Exploring the broader world of the game, including other buildings and missions on the island, allows you to enjoy unforgettable experiences in your adventure with Kevin on the island.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T08:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/45442a347574263090f5919339d946a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cankut Keskin"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cankut Keskin"], "esrb_rating": null}
