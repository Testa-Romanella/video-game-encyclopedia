An aching loss left behind. A new blossom, a new beginning.\"<br/>Zenza is a calming yet strategic puzzle game taking the player on a journey through the seasons. Put colors or shapes together to achieve balance. Progress through 80 increasingly challenging levels to perfect your zen. Leaves, blossoms, or snow may fall. There's always a chance to start anew. Zenza is based off of Kigo Haiku, a form of Japanese poems thematically relating to the seasons.<br/><br/>Play through the four seasons:<br/><ul><li>Spring - The Cherry Tree (Sakura) Blooms<br/></li><li>Summer - The Bonsai is Trimmed in Rainy Season<br/></li><li>Fall - The Momiji Maple Leaves Fall<br/></li><li>Winter - The Oak Tree is covered in Snow</li></ul><br/>Zenza is a \"no fail\" game; you can slice your unwanted tiles away, blow away your deck of tiles with the wind or undo a move at will.

Zenza allows you to use your wits and will to create your perfect game board.<br/><br/>Featuring a dynamic 2D lighting system and an original soundtrack.
