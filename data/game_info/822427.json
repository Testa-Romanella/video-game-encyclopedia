You must drag and assign a die to each slot before confirming your action! Each slot is assigned to a different value: Attack, Accuracy, Power, and Critical. Four attacks will be displayed in the bottom row. To pick an attack, drag a die with its number into the attack slot (in this case, any roll greater than 4 will function as if it WERE 4). Accuracy is the minimum roll required to hit. Assign a roll greater or equal to the attacks accuracy to land your hit!\u00a0\u00a0Power contributes to the damage of the move! The total damage you deal will be the power of the attack PLUS the value of your power die!\u00a0Critical works similar to accuracy: this is the minimum roll required to score a devastating critical hit. On a successful critical hit, your attack will deal double damage!<br/></p>\n<p>Fight through waves of enemies and wrack up the highest score you can!</p>\n<p>Many different creatures await for you to battle with in... <strong>DRAGON DICE!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>David Draper\u00a0 (HandODoom) - Game Design, Programming, Art, Music\r\n</p>\n<p>James Giancioppo (Wugglett) - Game Design, Programming</p>\n<p>Nathan Weidman (weedynate) - Voice Acting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd82cc56cf66d5f769f4d1ea3868c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HandODoom"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
