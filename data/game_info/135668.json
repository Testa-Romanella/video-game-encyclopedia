Are you the professional monster hunter I called?</p>\n<p> Good. I really need some help. The house you're about to enter is overrun by monsters. Really nasty, mean types. If they see you, they won't hesitate to attack. You have a weapon, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A rusty knife? I guess that'll work. You'll probably find more weapons as you explore the house. Don't forget to check your monster hunting journal if you get stuck. Good luck out there! Try not to die!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move around. Run into events to trigger them.</p>\n\n<p>This is a game I made in Visual Studio for my programming final. The controls aren't completely smooth, but it works pretty well and It's completely free.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. If you find a bug, let me know. If you think the game could use a character customization screen or another ending, I'd love to hear about it. I always check the comments, so I'll be sure to reply!</p>\n<p>Note: I never got to finishing the event that requires the sword to work. Let me know if you think it's worth going back and adding that in!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbd9d623b884a24e510aeb33dc66146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DefinitelyNotAShark"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
