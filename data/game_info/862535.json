Each day it\u2019s expected to deliver a certain number of sheeps to its owner\u2019s barn. The requests lately have lost all touch with reality though, the number of sheeps expected are greater than the ones available to our hero. Fortunately a nearby nuclear fallout will make these demands attainable once more. Careful though, there might be wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing amidst Dog\u2019s ranks.</p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds a rain of nuclear fallout will force the sheeps to make a hard choice: duplicate and make our hero\u2019s life easier or turn into a wolf and feast on its previous brothers and sisters. Dog\u2019s objective is to take it\u2019s starting flock and allow it to proliferate and reach the desired amount of sheeps before bringing them to the barn to end the day of work while simultaneously keeping the wolves at bay. The only tool available to accomplish all of this is Dog\u2019s mighty bark. Barking at a sheep will kindly invite it to go towards the direction that Dog is pointing towards. This power can also be used also to save a sheep that is about to get eaten by a wolf and push it away from the predator.\r\n</p>\n<p>Commands:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move Dog around the field\r\n</li><li>Left-click or B to bark\r\n</li><li>Mouse pointer to focus the bark in the direction of the sheep</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Changelog (updates after submission):\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>fixed wrong flipping of bark range\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>provided continous music across levels\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>fixed rain infection applying only once\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>fixed the shed accepting sheeps still mutating</strong>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb643bcee9d2c789018557129a9813e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fiordarancio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
