Originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 and FM Towns, it was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and PC Engine CD-ROM\u00b2 (TurboGrafx-CD) in 1994\u20131995, including an expanded re-release titled Brandish Renewal. The SNES version was published by Koei in Japan in 1994 and in North America in 1995.</p>\n<p>Brandish was the first title in Nihon Falcom&#39;s series of the same name. It was followed by three sequels originally released between 1993 and 1995.</p>\n<p>Brandish is a top-down view dungeon crawler game. The original version of the game uses mouse controls from a real-time overhead view, where the player can move the warrior character Ares (known as Varik in the original English version) forward and backward, turn, strafe, and attack by clicking on boxes surrounding the player character. The player&#39;s objective is to escape from a labyrinth of over 40 floors filled with various monsters, traps and puzzles.</p>\n<p>Brandish: The Dark Revenant turns the game&#39;s female antagonist Dela into an optional alternate player character. Dela, a magician, plays differently from the protagonist Ares the warrior. The game&#39;s &quot;Dela Mode&quot; is shorter (lasting about 10 hours as compared to some 20 hours with Ares) but harder than the main scenario. Xseed Games&#39; localization blog compared The Dark Revenant to Etrian Odyssey series with &quot;the tough but fair difficulty of Dark Souls.&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-23T16:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edbe325292416900f38057c37cbe183e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Nihon Falcom", "KOEI"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Koei", "NIHON FALCOM"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
