Will you find the missing puppy?</p>\n\n<p>Reflection&amp;Artist Statement: I just really like dogs. The typical cliche in movies and other forms of media is some helpless kid's dog goes missing and the main character has to go find it. Some challenges were figuring out how to place the ending without taking away from the story, but that was remedied by duplicating each room and sprite. I just really wanted to make a quick, fun game where you tried to find a missing puppy and everyone seems to have seen it run off, except you.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6df254fc0c9d59d7d40118a85bbfc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bork Enterprises"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
