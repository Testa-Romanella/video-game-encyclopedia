Your job is to guide a chosen few citizens in the beginning, to a few thousand later on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour kingdom will require resources. Build quarries, mines and forest industries to get resources. Use the resources to either build new buildings, or sell them to other kingdoms for gold. The gold in turn can be used to buy unique items to strengthen your city, or tropical crops to make sure your citizens get a healthy diet.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is a harsh world, and there are plenty of challenges for your city. Your citizens require food, housing, entertainment and security. There\u2019s also threats from outside the city, from other kingdoms wanting to grab your riches. These kingdoms might act on these interests and send raids to your lands, or they might go another way and try diplomacy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T05:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1d0632521ea0742f8bee9e58d555f97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["North Gold Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["North Gold Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
