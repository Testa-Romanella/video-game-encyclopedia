Arson Axolotls was based on old drawings of characters I made.</p>\n<p>2. Arson is the act of purposefully setting fire to property, or the act of killing using fire.</p>\n<p>3. Press letter keys in the lobby and some cool stuff might happen :)</p>\n<p>4. There are currently 82 sprites and about 6400 blocks.</p>\n<p>5. Splash, the newest character, was made within 3 days. He isn't Blue. He's more of a mix of Cobalt and Lapis.</p>\n<p>6. I have a YouTube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/@lagmaster_gaming</p>\n<p>7. This game was made on Scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T12:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a110c906c80434b6e7a776297c211a69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Axe-olotl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
