With this ability, you can crawl through small holes or jump higher when stretched up. There are also death coins that you must avoid, or they bring you back to the start. And if you get stuck,\u00a0 just fall to the void.</p>\n<p>Player 1 Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W = Stretch Up\u00a0</li><li>S = Shrink Down</li><li>A &amp; D = Move</li><li>Space\u00a0= Jump</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Up Arrow = Stretch Up\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Down Arrow = Shrink Down\r\n</li><li>Left &amp; Right Arrows = Move\r\n</li><li>Right Shift = Jump</li></ul>\n<p>This game is my Ludum Dare 40 entry. It may lack polish and content, but at least I got the main features implemented.
