You and your viewers try to be the last one standing as the land falls into the water.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour viewers use your streaming channel chat to decide their moves. Then the fun begins as random or voted events trigger falling blocks, player fights, or birds coming to get them!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the last animal standing, doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re the winner. If the birds and players don\u2019t get you, the events can still take you out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo play, connect your Twitch account.  Set up your streaming gear depending on what you use, via OBS, Streamlabs OBS,  XSplit, Bebo, Wirecast, Vmix, Elgato Game Capture, or Gameshow Live.
