Will you be submerged or will you escape? Even though you don't know how you got there, it's pretty clear that someone is trying to mess with you. This game was made by me in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 42.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements!</p>\n<p>Gif:</p>\n\n<p>Video:</p>\n\n<p>Notes:\u00a0<br/>1) Don't Drown is based on a large scale fluid simulation being done in real time using multiple cores on your CPU. However, this means that it is also pretty computationally intensive. Be warned if you are on a slightly weaker computer.</p>\n<p>2) Even though I didn't include it in the instructions, if you have a gamepad you can use that instead of keyboard. I think it's a lot nicer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e0d1057bfb756bec4db370e50b928e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schsam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
