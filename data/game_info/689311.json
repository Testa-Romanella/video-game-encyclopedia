(for getting hit and for dying), completely\u00a0new tileset for level 1.</p>\n\n<p>level 1: find the key and make your way to the door! If you don't move, lav might stomp to the music :) make sure to check out the voice lines!</p>\n<p>level 2: We're in space! Gravity is low. fall down the column and move left and right to avoid the traps. You have unlimited jumps! Make the most of them</p>\n<p>level 3: a..normal level? sure, you could call it that. But see if you can finish the level without jumping! You'd be surprised ;)</p>\n\n<p>Credits: Lavender character, splash art, UI, sprites, animations and sound effects created by Farhan Parekh</p>\n<p>'Soil' tileset created by Farhan Parekh</p>\n<p>song used that weren't mine: provided music, as well as 'Fluffing a Duck', by Kevin Macleod.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed294c68a9a16e8af0540a5cc13cdd9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["FarhanP"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
