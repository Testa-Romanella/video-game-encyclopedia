Each hazard has their own effect - the ramp causes cars to fly into the air, oil makes the spin out, etc.<br/><br/>But if the car hits you, you're a road pancake.<br/><br/>Anivenge has two play modes. In one you work you way up through levels, each giving you a different challenge such as more lanes, faster cars, narrower gaps, etc. Then there's survival mode - crash as many cars as you can before you get hit, with the cars going faster as time goes by.<br/><br/>Early release features a single playable character (a frog), 3 different hazards and over 30 levels.<br/><br/>Features definitely coming during Early Release:<br/><ul><li>Many, many more levels, possibly 70 more<br/></li><li>At least one more hazard (a bomb!)<br/></li><li>Different playable characters (rabbit, gopher, etc)<br/></li><li>2 new \"special\" vehicles<br/></li><li>More background music (so you don't have to listen to the same song every level)</li></ul><br/>Features being considered for development:<br/><ul><li>Remappable controls<br/></li><li>Controller support<br/></li><li>New playable characters decided by polls<br/></li><li>More dramatic crash effects<br/></li><li>Steam achievements and/or leaderboards<br/></li><li>Other features as requested by players</li></ul>And of course, any bugs that are reported will be fixed.
