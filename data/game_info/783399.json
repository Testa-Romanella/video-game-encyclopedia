I also am not a fan of games that need a page-reload to reset. Plus full-screen support is pretty easy in Ct.js - so I just have to try the settings and pick the one I like. Internet scores aren't out of the question if I can get my server working again. I can also hopefully get the timing of the \"Great\" just right and maybe even hit the player with more birds as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>The game needs key focus\u00a0(usually a click to begin) and you can only survive, you can't win it (yet).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/668a25cf7bfca27230aa2a9274767b85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["markmehere"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
