It turns out one of her classmates is a childhood friend that seems overly eager to reunite with her. Around this time, there seems to be someone that lurks closely behind Suki wherever she goes. In attempts to avoid her stalker, she runs into a delinquent that seems two have two sides of her besides her rough exterior.</p>\n<p>{NOTES: I wrote, drew, edited, and coded everything with the help of Ren'Py. The music in the demo is by Emilie Autumn which I have permission from the artist's manager to use this song, as long as it's not for profit. But, I will be having original music that I put together in the final version of 1.0.}</p>\n<p>[This is essentially a yandere yuri.
