Maybe squash? A pumpkin is a type of squash, right? Just download and play already!</p>\n<p><strong>How To Trick-Or-Treat:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Hit the haunted skull ball</strong> into the doors on the other side of the net to knock on them and dispense candy.<br/></li><li><strong>Collect the colorful candy</strong> that falls out of the doors to earn points. Just touch them with your tombstone paddles.<br/></li><li><strong>Protect the doors on your side</strong> of the net so that your opponent doesn't get their dark candy.</li><li><strong>Collect the most candy</strong> by the 2 minute deadline to win!</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Squeeze the trigger to extend your tombstone sportgame paddles out farther.</em></li><li><em>Beware that the skull ball has a mind of its own sometimes, and has nothing but contempt for you, and will try to trick you.</em></li><li><em>The candy disappears after a few seconds so be quick about it!</em></li><li><em>If you're stuck on the title screen - just swing your arms around rapidly for a few seconds, like it asks you to. You should feel the haptics building up as you go.</em></li></ul>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for Spooky VR Jam.
