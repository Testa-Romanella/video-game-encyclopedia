The player is only able to obtain shotgun ammo by using the lightning, and can only increase the lightning power over a certain threshold by defeating enemies with the shotgun. The player must be able to use both these abilities effectively, so that they are able to fight every enemy in their way.</p>\r\nGuide\r\n<p>In this demo, the warrior emerges from an alien tunnel into the base of a secluded pyramid. Here, he must fight to the top of the structure, finding there a disc that covers the entrance to an underground alien installation. Defeating the enemies that stand in the way, the warrior reaches a portal, ending the demo.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nCredits &amp; Acknowledgments\r\n<p><strong>Hugo Feliciano</strong><br/>Programmer and 3D Texture Artist</p>\n<p><strong>In\u00eas Barradas</strong><br/>Concept &amp; 3D Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Pedro M.
