{"id": 960468, "slug": "tetragun-2", "name": "TETRAGUN", "name_original": "TETRAGUN", "description": "In TETRAGUN you control a turret surrounded on all sides by unrelenting waves of enemies. After each wave, you'll choose from a wide variety of upgrades that will help you survive and allow you to discover powerful synergies. Unfortunately for you, your enemies will also gain access to upgrades and abilities that will make them more of a threat. Each run of TETRAGUN is randomized, so you'll need to be adaptable to make it out in one piece.<h3>Quadrant Based</h3>In TETRAGUN, the battlefield is separated into four quadrants. Your turret will only be able to aim within one quadrant at a time, requiring you to rotate between them on the fly. This takes time, so deliberate prioritization is the key to success.<h3>Score Big</h3>Shoot for the highest score you can! Enemies are worth more score the earlier you eliminate them, and chaining eliminations together quickly will boost your score multiplier.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> 25 Turret Upgrades<br/></li><li> 8 Enemy Upgrades<br/></li><li> 5 Weapons<br/></li><li> 5 Abilities<br/></li><li> 4 Difficulties<br/></li><li> 30+ Steam Achievements<br/></li><li> Layered soundtrack composed by Kayla Okus</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c39a43f99eefac5f5b41abaad6ca1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Greeb"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Greeb Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
