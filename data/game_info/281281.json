{"id": 281281, "slug": "little-square-things", "name": "Little Square Things", "name_original": "Little Square Things", "description": "Congratulations, warehouse keeper! You've been promoted!<br/><br/>Little Square Things is a Sokoban-like puzzle game. The objective is simple: Move boxes around to cover up some panels.<br/><br/>But this isn't your father's warehouse. In Little Square Things, you are the boxes. All of them. All of the Square Things respond to your every move, and so it's up to you keep them coordinated, in sync, and in line. Guide them through a series of challenging (and hazardous!) environments to get those panels covered!<br/><br/>It also draws inspiration from games like Brix and Chip's Challenge. From walls to water, from bullets to buzzsaws -- other elements either stand in your way or help you out, depending on your perspective. And different Square Things behave differently. Some follow your commands directly and to the letter, though some slip and slide or laze about until pushed. And some Square Things have to be sacrificed for the greater good. And if that weren't enough, the geometry itself is an obstacle: Boards wrap around, and null spaces literally don't exist.<br/><br/>As a master shepherd of sheep and cats alike, you are the Square Things' beacon of hope in these complicated times.<br/><br/><strong>New! Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and SoundBlaster support!</strong><br/><br/>With its futuristic 16-color graphics and Musical Instrument Digital Interface, Little Square Things is going to blow you away. So boot up your i386, tinker with your CONFIG.SYS, and crack your knuckles in preparation for that DOS prompt, because it's time to play a game! Also, it's 1991!<br/><br/><strong>Reach for the stars!</strong><br/><br/>As you nab stars, you unlock more levels. Cover your panels to earn stars, and complete levels under a certain number of moves to earn more.<br/><br/>When you revisit a level, though, you'll find it to be familiar but subtly different. It turns out that you've unlocked another goal for the level: collecting star shards. The layout's the same, but the tactics are much, much different. You'll have to be prepared to bend your thinking accordingly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-03T13:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/187/18757f9136e3b724ca33559ed4bfd2eb.jpg", "website": "https://gsreed.com/lst/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gbelo Games", "gbelo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["gbelo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
