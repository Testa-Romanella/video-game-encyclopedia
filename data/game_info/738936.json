Just like in metal slug we will face many enemies in a frantic battle with a 90's retro flavor. The game allows you to accumulate game coins to carry out weapon upgrades in the shop. Everything was created to get as close as possible to the experience that metal slug offered in the 90s. <br/></p>\n<p>Commands : WASD for moving</p>\n<p>A D : for shooting</p>\n<p>next update :\u00a0 <strong>integration of the pad coming soon ....\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7448121d7efc8f5d96080fb3af3c9c0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 446, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slugs82"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
