I will most likely continue to update this game after the game jam to make the appearance more enticing and to fix any bugs that I might have missed. I would also like to add an alternative attack like an uppercut and add many different types of enemies like some that float in different directions or launch projectiles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0a4bcad4fc4d8f193a5a2bd4e44688e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JasonEngland"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
