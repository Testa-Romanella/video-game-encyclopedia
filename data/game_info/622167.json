This sounds easy at first but be aware... the logs get thrown harder making them faster than ever the more you progress!</p>\n<p>To play the game simply use W A S D and Space. W A S and D will move your duck around the map and Space will enter the duck in a state in which he cannot be hit by the logs. This only lasts for one second!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8e9e086697dbe363794cd60b5eee68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["carson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
