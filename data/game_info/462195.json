Do we lock everyone in their homes, or we save the economy?</p>\n<p>Your ultimate objective is to reach zero infections and end with the disease. To do so, you have several choices to do, like entering lockdown and building hospitals.</p>\n<p>Your budget will depend on the activity in your economy. Lockdowns decrease greatly the amount of budget you earn each day, which means less hospitals to deal with the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Try to balance everything and win the game!</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1 changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The simulator is functional, but not really nerfed. It is weird to play. The frontend is very basic. No savegame functionality. No graphs.</p>\n<p>There is a bug with the reproduction rate that causes daily infections to not reach zero ever. So in this iteration is not possible to win the game yet :(.</p>\n<p>Remember this is the first of a three iteration project. The next iteration is to come in a few hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2 changelog</strong></p>\n<p>The numbers are updated for a bit of a more serious gameplay. Now it kinda makes sense although full lockdown makes an easy gameplay. We'll iterate on this for M3.</p>\n<p>Redesigned a bit with tables the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3 changelog</strong></p>\n<p>We've got graphs! The numbers have been adjusted for an actual challenging simulation. Still not optimal, but playable. All the constants can be manually changed before starting the simulation through a form.</p>\n<p>This is the final version released for Triple Trijam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda6cf7369b6b7f8f05e0eb71263b03c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marquii"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
