Give it a play, take your time, talk to villagers (particularly those inside homes) and get a feel for the world, the characters and the story I'm attempting to tell. Most of all, have fun.</p><p><strong>You\r\nAre The Reason \u2013 Super Awesome Fact Sheet </strong></p><p><strong>(Please\r\ndo ask me for more info if any of these points interests you)</strong></p><p><strong>What is YATR and\r\nwhat engine is it being made in? - </strong>YATR is a top down 2D RPG made\r\nin RPG Maker, currently in the process of being ported to Unity\r\nthrough the use of black magic. For now unfortunately, it's only available for Windows users.</p><p><strong>What's the story of\r\nYATR? - </strong>YATR centres on a young girl born with magical abilities\r\nin a world where the gift of magic is seen to corrupt all who wield\r\nit. It's the ultimate stigma. You can use magic? You're going to try\r\nand use it to kill us all, we should probably make sure that doesn't\r\nhappen before you have a chance to turn. The game centres on our\r\nhero's journey into the world to prove she can use her magic for\r\ngood, while escaping a growing mob pursuing her for what she can do.</p><p><strong>Tell me about the\r\nMusic and Voice Acting -</strong> Features a soundtrack by Youtube\r\nsensation Brent Black (Brentalfloss, the guy who makes those game\r\ntheme tune with lyrics videos) and voice acting from a wide varied\r\ncast including Escapist Reviews Editor Jim Sterling. The voice cast\r\nincludes two very young children, some Trans voice actors playing\r\nCisgender roles and vice versa, as well as being a cast containing\r\nmore women than men.</p><p><strong>What makes your RPG\r\nbattle system unique? - </strong>While your character is incredibly\r\npowerful, the combat system requires you to resist the urge to attack\r\nand use non violent means to progress. Our hero has a thing about not\r\nkilling humans, she's really not keen on the idea if it can be\r\nhelped.</p><p><strong>So, is it true you\r\nplay as a Trans person? - </strong>The Protagonist of You Are The Reason\r\nis Transgender. This is not a core plot point reveal, not is it the\r\ncrux of her narrative arc, it's just a thing about her that exists.\r\nIt effects some of the ways she interacts with those around her, it\r\nimpacts how she interacts with the world but this is not a game about\r\nher transition by any means.</p><p><strong>Who is making the\r\ngame? - </strong>The game is being made by me, Laura Kate Dale\r\n(@LauraKBuzz). I'm a games journalist and founding member of Indie\r\ngaming site IndieHaven.com. I started working on You Are The Reason\r\nas part of an experiment for the site, a challenge to see if creating\r\na game for myself would change my perspective as a critic and have a\r\npositive effect on my writing. I can tell you that I have certainly\r\nlearnt a lot from the process.</p><p><strong>Want to know more\r\nabout the game? I don't bite, feel free to Tweet @LauraKBuzz or email LauraK@IndieHaven.com. I'm happy to do interviews or press stuff for people.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/165a99fe520953ba106f59ebe9d30c4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laura Kate Dale"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
