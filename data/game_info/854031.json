However, for this project I decided to go a bit out of my comfort zone and do almost entirely (technical) art enhancements. I wanted to see how much I could polish the game without the addition of any significant new assets. I also decided to completely change the mood of the level with all that that entails. Finally, I did a couple small programming changes to fix some things that bugged me about the original game. I would have liked to create some custom shaders but was unable to do so within the time limit due to the already-implemented cel-shading asset being incompatible with URP and therefore preventing the use of shader graph. I attempted to write shaders using code but was unable to figure it out within the time available for the project.</p>\n<p>Note: All enhancements are intended for the 3D display mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor enhancements:</strong></p>\n<p>- Fixed missing collider on cliff faces</p>\n<p>- Prevented getting stuck on stairs by changing to convex collider</p>\n<p>- Brought all other relevant enhancements to the battle scene (lighting, post-processing, particle effects)</p>\n<p><strong>Major enhancements:</strong></p>\n<p>- Tweaked player movement (added a double-jump, added coyote time)</p>\n<p>- Added post-processing (depth of field, bloom, vignette, color correction)</p>\n<p>- Completely redid lighting and tweaked materials for a different theme (directional light, ambient light, skybox color and light, player lighting, cel-shaded material lighting)</p>\n<p>- Added particle effects:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Rain (including collisions, shadows, and sub-emitters for splashes and ripples)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Fireflies (including color affected by speed, flickering, noise, and collisions to <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0avoid objects)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 - Lightning (noise, sub-emitters for additional bolts)\u00a0 \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>- Added effects when hit in combat (all scale to damage of hit):</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Screen shake</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Red flash (darker on armor)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Animation pause<br/></p>\n<p>Created by Walker.\u00a0 Base\u00a0project\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Games\u00a0and\u00a0Interactive\u00a0Media\u00a0program\u00a0at\u00a0MSU.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T15:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f562b57c9c793e3aeb7596edebc3032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DWMcDonald"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
