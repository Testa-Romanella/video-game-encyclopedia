Remember - you're being watched by the superiour, who decides your destiny based on your performance. How, you may ask? In the best manner the lady fortuna can! By making it random! HAHAHA!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD to confidently move around<br/>Arrow Keys to crush your enemies to dust</p>\n<p>K to spare your enemies and seal your fate<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>This is a top down hack and slash with the element of randomness. After you kill a number of enemies, your next weapon and its element are decided randomly! For you! You don't even have to choose! Isn't that convenient?</p>\n<p><em>Harness the power of your mighty arsenal!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sword of the Chance</strong>: Hack through your enemies quickly, and efficiently!</p>\n<p><strong>Axe of the Luck</strong>: Mow down your foes like they're but grass leaves!</p>\n<p><strong>Mace of the Fortune</strong>: Keep your enemies at the distance to remind themselves who they are!</p>\n<p><em>Use the nature at your disposal to come out victorious!<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Wood </strong>breaks apart and leaves splinters in your enemies bleeding to death! How do toys bleed? You want them to, so they will.</p>\n<p><strong>Rubber\u00a0</strong>is elastic and pushes your enemies even farther away! Not enough to not smell their bad breath, though, so do them justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Plastic.</strong> Have you noticed how much plastic is there? There's like a ton of plastic around. Which means your weapons are bigger and have more range. Just recycle it properly afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>BlueMew: Gameplay, Design, Coding, Physics, <em>absolutely making it work<br/></em></p>\n<p>Ratlin Paats: Sound Design, Music, Coding, Physics<br/></p>\n<p>YoshiBobby: Art, Designs, Sprites</p>\n<p>PutzRitsu: UI Elements, Designs, Sprites<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0b08bfa6cb720c6136238b09de76a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ritsu", "Bobby_Z", "Ratlin Paats", "BlueMew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
