With a cast of \n      crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a \n      pulsing musical score, ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of \n      twitchy platforming goodness.\n    </p><p>\n      The two-button setup is disarmingly simple. One button shoots downwards, \n      propelling you through the air. The other shoots forward, destroying \n      anything that\u2019s in your path. There is no stopping in this beautifully \n      surreal world littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles \n      around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between \n      the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels \n      where death is a promise not a possibility. There is only running, \n      gunning, jumping, and gunning, in a mad dash to survive long enough to \n      die again.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4c7cd5aa0f04549a14038c763de97f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Android"], "developers": ["Good Shepherd Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Gambitious"], "esrb_rating": null}
