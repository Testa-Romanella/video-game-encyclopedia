Main goal of Miz Jam 1 is everybody is making a game with same art kit in 48 hours. Also my game's mechanic, network, game loop and all other things\u00a0took 48 hours in Godot Engine but making game browser\u00a0didn't turn out as I hoped and took 48 hours alone because It was my first time with javascript and using Firestore as database. So actually 96 hours took to make this game :D . Database is for storing server ip and name thus anybody can see\u00a0 anybody's server.</p>\n<p>Todos:</p>\n<p>#BUG When you join after the game is started, you become invisible</p>\n<p># I need to make a effect or health bars to show bullet touched to opponent</p>\n<p>#players shouldn't be able to go back to lobby room</p><p>#matchmaking system instead of hosting indiviually</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b56ac649917b2dac2fed0164b63c1de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["cenullum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
