So on its way, it will need to consume smaller asteroids to grow and avoid bigger asteroid and missiles. Asteroids you can consume will have a blue outline so you don't make \"size-check mistakes\".</p>\n<p>There are 3 phases of gameplay where asteroids rates and size as well as missile rates will increase.</p>\n<p>Multiple endings are available.</p>\n<p>This game was made during a Human Academy Game Jam, more info in the in-game credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T17:39:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917bd1a3ef3d202cfe6d390a3de14e69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackRoxton"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
