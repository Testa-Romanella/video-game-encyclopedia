Your Goal is to deliver as many resources as you can. After flying through the system long enough, your Care-Cargo will drop itself off automatically. Each delivery will earn you a charming bounty of sweet, soft toilet paper rolls. Walk up to your ship's dashboard and pres SPACE to control the ship with WASD. But be careful not to let your engine over heat. Keep an eye on the engine's temperature at the bottom right. To toggle the coolant system on and off, press SPACE next to the engine console. Be careful not to leave it on for too long; your engine could flood! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4fa05c645e9085c89d48f3644a979a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dhdylan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
