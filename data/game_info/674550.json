Thinking that the murderer might still be on the premises, you bring along an armed officer, but do you believe it to be just a simple murder? Or could it be something more sinister?</p>\n<p>Your backup goes missing and the building is quiet... too quiet... Disquiet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Development Notes:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>The game is a concept for a horror game based on murder scene investigation. Many things can be considered unclear or not explained well enough.</p>\n<p>For example, batteries are not collected, but rather simply recharges your flashlight (this feature only exists in this concept build of the game).</p>\n<p>This game was made as a first-year college game design project. Keep that in mind when playing as Disquiet can be seen as an amateur game regardless of its release status.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Notes for the Curious:</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>There are MANY parts of the game that you will most likely miss. One example of this is that looking through the first security camera after going up the stairs will give you chills.</p>\n<p>There is one easter egg in the game. Not a pop-culture reference, but an easter egg nonetheless. We'll let you find it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T05:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/247/2474dea0b3c7fa63ff8f186307c8e611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coded Cookie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
