{"id": 91357, "slug": "to-kill-a-black-swan", "name": "To Kill A Black Swan", "name_original": "To Kill A Black Swan", "description": "<p>A short murder mystery visual novel about a detective, a yoga course attendant, a grieving wife, an obsessed cleaner, a \"bro\", and a bitchy friend. <strong>To Kill A Black Swan</strong> is not your average whodunit, nothing is as it seems to be, it is all about superficiality (and beneath the surface it has an important message to tell.) <strong>TKABS</strong> was created for the 2014 Indie Game Development Contest and is available for free. The title is inspired by <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> by Harper Lee, but it is an original story. </p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/> Story, characters, music \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br/> Sprites \u2013 www.all-silhouettes.com, edited by Marcel Weyers<br/> Backgrounds \u2013 www.publicdomainpictures.net, edited by Marcel Weyers<br/> Additional graphics \u2013 Torsten Sohrmann<br/> Sound effects \u2013 www.freesound.org<br/> Proofreaders \u2013 Reika Aoyama, kisa<br/> Engine \u2013 Ren'Py</p>\n<p>German translation \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br/> Polish translation \u2013 Damian K.<br/> Dutch translation <strong>\u2013</strong> Bob Reus (Visualnovels.nl)</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong><br/> Title: To Kill A Black Swan<br/> Release: June 25, 2014<br/> Genre: Short story, murder mystery<br/> Rated: 16+<br/> Resolution: 1280\u00d7800<br/> Platforms: Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux<br/> Endings: 1 true ending, bad endings with variations<br/> Languages: Dutch, English, German, Polish</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c76b5e9cfab796ff2155ed01f8d500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Marcel Weyers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
