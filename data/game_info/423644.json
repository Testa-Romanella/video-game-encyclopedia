{"id": 423644, "slug": "a-platform-game", "name": "A Platform Game.", "name_original": "A Platform Game.", "description": "<p>This short game is a linear progression through 40 reasonably easy levels. Since there is no story or goal other than making it through the 40 levels I\u00a0added a timer and highscore table for speedruns to make it a little more interesting.</p>\n<p>The controls are displayed in the game via level hints at the start of each level. The hints get in the way a bit,\u00a0so if you no longer need them I suggest turning them off in the options. No custom keybinding yet, I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0am considering making a platformer puzzle/adventure game and this is me testing out various mechanics to see what works and get an idea of how to make\u00a0 games in Unity and C#. If you like the idea of a\u00a0platformer puzzle/adventure game in this style consider poking a few pennies in this direction. :)</p>\n<p>Any constructive feedback is welcome, and I'm sure there will be bugs I haven't found yet, who can find the strangest one?</p>\n<p>Edit:\u00a0The level select and statistics page is hidden. You can get to it by going to the Options Screen and then wall jumping up off the top of the screen. It was meant to be a bonus secret, but if it's just annoying maybe I\u00a0should make it easier to access.</p>\n<p>Latest Update: Had a go at making the jump tolerance a little nicer and fixing the bug that stopped level hints from being displayed.</p>\n\n<p>KEY FEATURES:</p>\n<p>Erm, some platforms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little man that can jump on those platforms.</p>\n<p>Various exciting 2D platformer mechanics like jumping.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS: The controls are given to you at the beginning of relevant levels as level hints, but here they are in case you wanted a list.\u00a0On some levels certain controls will be unavailable by design.</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to move left and right.</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to climb and descend ladders.</p>\n<p>Space Bar to jump. Can also be done when rolling for a boost.</p>\n<p>R to roll when running.

Cursor will turn green if target can be possessed. When possessed,\u00a0enemies and objects can be controlled, try moving them.</p>\n<p>C to create a clone. Cursor will turn green if clone can be created. If you die, your clone dies as well. If your clone dies, it's fine, just make another.</p>\n<p>I to open/close your inventory.\u00a0 Right-click on an item in the inventory to drop it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/239/239bfdecefcbdbd68478fd86e98f9b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infernal Device"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
