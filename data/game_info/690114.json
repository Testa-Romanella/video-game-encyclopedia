Please don't resize the window after the title screen.</em><br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>The game uses analogue movement and one button. Gamepads are recommended.</li><li>Move with the analogue sticks, unmask and use special abilities with a face button. Stop moving to shoot.</li><li>You can use the arrow or WASD keys and space bar/enter instead.</li><li>The game requires two input devices (you can't share gamepads or keyboards, sorry).</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nWhat is this?\r\n<p><em>This is a functional but  very unfinished prototype.</em></p>\n<p>This is a small game I've been developing over the past month. I hope you find it fun! Please try it for free and see if you like it.<br/></p>\n<p>The reason I'm releasing it in this state is because tomorrow I start a new job that won't allow me to publish games in my spare time.</p>\r\nCan you give me any strategy tips?\r\n<p>Unmasking is a powerful move that will instantly give you possession of the ball if it's nearby. Save it for the opportune moment!</p>\r\nAnything else I should know?\r\n<p>Contains cartoon spiders and undead.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7b7a0ab8d7fe7f6595d2b32083f6df4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["En Sattaur"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
