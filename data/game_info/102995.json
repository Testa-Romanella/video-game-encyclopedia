You can modify its hue, lightness and saturation. If a color opens a branch of the story, you will see the color appear in one of the circle under the text.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf the path has never been read, it will be a double circle. If a path has already been read, you'll see a simple circle.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere are 35 different endings in the game - some of them good, some of them bad, and others frankly weird. Good luck finding them all!<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCode by Diane Landais (@ker0chanFR), text by Emilie Mavel (@OsiraH)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade in July 2016 for A Game By Its Cover 2016\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b44dd0d0e338363e940a974062eeff2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diane", "emavel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
