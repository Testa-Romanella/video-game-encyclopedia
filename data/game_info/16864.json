Breakable walls, fireballs, acid spouts, and spikes are only some of the obstacles in your way.<br />\nCreated by ElevenSeventy, a team of two game lovers, Pavel Quest is the first commercial product released by ElevenSeventy. We opted to aim for a simple concept, and make it great. Over time we added features like gravity anomalies, bounce pads, fireballs, acid spouts, secret characters, and a replay system. All while preserving the balance of simplicity and difficulty. Pavel Quest is a hard game, but it is rewarding as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-19T01:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc58e39e04b44ae229bf7933fda7a774.jpg", "website": "http://elevenseventy.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ElevenSeventy"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ElevenSeventy"], "esrb_rating": null}
