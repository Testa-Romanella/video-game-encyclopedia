There\u00b4s a time limit before the game ends. And the cards which are collected on your journey and how you use them play a big role in who the winner turns out to be. There are three sizes of boards. The music and pixel-art helps create the vibes to make this a calm and smooth strategy gaming experience. Please leave a comment on whatever you felt about the game if you download it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53f/53f7370802177b292306dc49487d5844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["emcmonky"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
