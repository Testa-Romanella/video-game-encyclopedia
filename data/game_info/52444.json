It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.<br />\nIt was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry (see Golden age of arcade video games). When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.<br />\nThe game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system&#39;s sales and became the first &quot;killer app&quot; for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often used as a synecdoche representing video games as a whole.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1978-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T07:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c381fe2913f790fc4d66620e8add37b0.jpg", "website": "https://spaceinvaders.square-enix-games.com/", "rating": 3.77, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 50, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 39}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "Wii", "Android", "Atari 2600", "Game Boy Advance", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy", "Atari 7800", "Atari 5200", "Game Boy Color", "NES", "SNES", "Nintendo 64", "Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Atari", "Tose", "Taito", "Sonic Powered", "Sonic Powered Co.", "Sonic Powered Co", "Tose Co.", "Tose Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Atari", "Midway Games", "Midway", "Taito", "Sharp", "Sears", "Leisure &amp; Allied Industries", "Midway and Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
