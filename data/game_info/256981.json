To make the platformer, you have to play through it, first as an artist, then a programmer, then a playtester. You must get to the flags to get a checkpoint, or beat that level, by jumping from platform to platform and avoiding red spikes!</p>\n<p>Once you get to the final flag for the Artist, you will then become the programmer, and then the playtester.<br/>Each level is the same, but with a different challenge for whomever you're playing as!</p>\n<p><strong>Artist<br/></strong>You haven't completed the art yet, so all of the platforms are a mere dot!\u00a0<br/>Jump to the white dots, and you will reveal the art for that platform!<br/>Once you jump on them, they will be revealed for the rest of the game (unless you don't make the due date!).</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer<br/></strong>You haven't fixed all of the bugs, so when the platforms turn bright red you must be careful to avoid them, or they'll shock and kill you!</p>\n<p><strong>Playtester<br/></strong>You must complete the game within a time limit to prove you're good enough!</p><p>Video! Since it is too difficult, here is a video so everyone can see the whole game!</p>\n\n\n<p>You must also do all of this within the due date!
