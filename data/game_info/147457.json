{"id": 147457, "slug": "get-ducked", "name": "Get Ducked", "name_original": "Get Ducked", "description": "<p><strong>Find the lies and accuse the most ducks you can within 60 seconds!</strong> </p>\n<p>This project was made for\u00a0DGDG\u00a0Winter\u00a0Jam\u00a02018  </p>\n<p>Get Ducked is a single player 'speed' game, that requires you to read statements from suspects (who just so happen to be ducks) and quickly reference their ID card, to determine if the statements true, or a lie. Once you get enough statements correct, you can accuse them of being a Goose (duck duck goose very funny me) and the next suspect comes into the room. The goal is to interrogate the most ducks within 60 seconds.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Good</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>The music and sound effects are quite nice, with the music ramping as the player loses more and more time.</li><li>This project taught me alot about Unity's animation system, and I used it extensively to make the game feel more 'alive'</li><li>The game is quite fun, and very simple to pick up and play. The player can either press the buttons on the UI, or press the 1,2 and 3 keys on their numpad. The simple concept works incredibly well with the high speed feel of the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>There wasn't really a vision with this game. Multiple times during development, the plan somewhat changed, resulting in alot of unused assets and code within the executable.</li><li>There is no way to exit the game within the game itself. Alt-F4 is your best friend here.</li><li>I didn't have time to implement wrap-around dates, so the date questions might be broken early in the year.</li><li>I spent about 5 hours total troubleshooting errors with the Unity installation instead of developing the game. At one point there was a project data loss scare at the beginning of the last day. Thanks imaged unity installs!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Recommended way to play</strong> <br/></p>\n<ol><li>Spend the      first run learning the controls and the layout of the suspect ID card. Use the second run as your actual legitimate score run.</li><li>Fullscreen at      1920x1080 (Full HD) resolution.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12210c3104bc728cae31d226440bd9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shuttah627"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
