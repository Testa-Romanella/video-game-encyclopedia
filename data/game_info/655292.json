Will be destroyed by timer, but doesn't look good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--- Planned Updates ---\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Arrow Key Movement</p>\n<p>-Fix above bugs</p>\n<p>-Procedural dungeon generation</p>\n<p>-Tutorial</p>\n<p>-Shop for cosmetics</p>\n<p>- More Enemies</p>\n<p>- More Weapons</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Credit to\u00a0Abstraction for game music -\u00a0<br/>http://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>http://www.abstractionmusic.com/</p>\n<p>Font used -\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/fff-forward-font.html</p>\n<p>Random Particle Effects\u00a0 by NYKNCK-\u00a0https://kvsr.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Majority of Game Art -\u00a0https://moose-stache.itch.io/pixel-roguelite-asset-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d83a1862e36d770ebf4dddc0348de758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["CornCobKing"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
