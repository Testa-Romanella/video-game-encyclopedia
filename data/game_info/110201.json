One player wears the VR headset and plays the role of the <em>Spy</em>, physically sneaking through the environment. The other player uses keyboard input and a command line interface to play the role of the\u00a0<em>Hacker</em>, typing in commands to hack the environment in the favor of their Spy. Each player has an incomplete view of the environment, so communication and trust is key.\u00a0\u00a0We're proud to present our Demo release of CtrlShift.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: Game will play best on monitors of 1920x1080 resolution or larger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8aa448e28ccf20d800cf5064d24ae7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Hive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
