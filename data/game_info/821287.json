At <strong>zero points, you lose</strong>. Your points are indicated next to the<strong> shield icon</strong> beneath the board.</p>\n\r\nHow To Kill\r\n\n<p>To kill enemies, you must <strong>roll the dice by clicking on it</strong>, this chooses a random attack from your pile, and you can cast it when you're ready by <strong>clicking the sword icon</strong> at the bottom.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Tip: You can click on cards to flip them over, revealing their names and stats. Hovering over them also shows your their attack range!</em></p>\r\nHow To Move\r\n<p>In Checkered\u00a0Dice, you can move absolutely <strong>anywhere\u00a0</strong>on the board! Simply <strong>click on the tile</strong> you want to travel to, and confirm the move by <strong>clicking on the Skull icon</strong> on bottom left of the screen.</p>\n\r\nBuffs\r\n\n<p>If you see a smaller sword icon and a plus icon next to the button, that signals to you that you are blessed with an <strong>attack buff </strong>and <strong>a chance to regain health</strong>! The attack buff is given to you if you <strong>move your piece before you obtain an attack</strong>. If you manage to kill an enemy while buffed, you gain a certain number of health!\u00a0</p>\n<p>How much you are buffed in damage and heals is detailed on the <strong>back of cards</strong>, in the format of:</p>\n\n<p>(Original damage + Extra damage) at the sword icon</p>\n<p>(Heal points) at the health icon</p>\n<p><em>Tip: Hovering over an enemy unit shows you how much health they have left</em></p>\r\nStrategy\r\n<p>As mentioned in the Buffs section, you are only rewarded with buffs when you move before you roll for an attack. This is due to the heightened risk of potentially landing in a position where your attack cannot be executed with maximum efficiency. You'll also notice that attacks which have desirable ranges of damage, also have lower damage, and attacks with narrower ranges that are harder to accommodate have much, much higher damage if done with a buff.</p>\n\n<p>That's all, have fun with the game!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Game:\u00a0 JBroook\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art: Scummy</p>\n<p>Music: MaximusCXI\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95e51166d57d3c42a46c5e737ac6164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBroook"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
