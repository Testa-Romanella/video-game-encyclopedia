EU operations undertaken by their security organization, Frontex, uses methods that are often illegal and unacceptable, such as putting migrant boats back onto the open sea, to control the influx.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The player in the game takes the role of a migrant out at sea on one of the common routes from Turkey to Greece. They can never make it to Greece, so the game is endless. The only way out on the path is to die. This is symbolic of the endlessness that comes with the life of a migrant. Even when they reach European lands, they are subjected to degrading conditions and are in limbo in terms of their citizenship for years. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/758311b6cbf81ba02bbb7fd90270cb76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["starschumi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
