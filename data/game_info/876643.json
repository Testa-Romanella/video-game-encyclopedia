Your goal is to take numbers and turn them into other numbers. If you turn them into the right numbers, you win.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, I was only able to create a level editor and no actual levels. However, levels\u00a0<em>can</em> be uploaded into the level editor, so in theory one can create endless content for the game!</p>\n<p>Fun fact about this game: Most of the game's logic is implemented inside of a fragment shader that runs on your GPU. This has no practical purpose whatsoever and was only done as a challenge.</p><p>Theme: My reasoning as to why this fits the theme is twofold:</p><ul><li>I was originally inspired by Factorio in making a game like this. In Factorio, you have to build a factory with conveyor belts and whatnot. A lot of the difficulty comes from later portions of your factory\u00a0being disrupted by your earlier ones. I wanted to recreate this same experience of tripping over yourself trying to solve a problem, where solving one half of the problem breaks the other, and vice-versa.</li><li>I was my own worst enemy while developing this game because I thought it'd be funny to implement all the game logic into a fragment shader.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T05:33:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e9c54f75a67e8e85fdedac3f062c225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["radian628"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
