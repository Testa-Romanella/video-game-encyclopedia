His YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/BenBonk</p>\n<p>Using just 4 colors was a required limitation of this jam so I decided to make my game very\u00a0green-forward since I associate BenBonk with that color. I started by selecting this palette by Tofu:\u00a0https://lospec.com/palette-list/moonlight-gb\u00a0and then modified it a bit.</p>\n<p>The optional theme was \"keep it away\" so I\u00a0thought of my experiences with dieting and how that mostly involved keeping food away. Then I thought that it'd be better to promote enjoying things in moderation rather than totally forgoing food. So the goal of this game is maintaining a balance.</p>\n<p>You will be assisting Sam in keeping a healthy body weight and her struggles are represented in 5 minigames chosen at random. Most of them will involve keeping her away from junk food but letting her enjoy a little is also key to your success. Her weight is always in a state of flux.\u00a0After each minigame, the difficulty ramps up slightly and by the end, the games can be fast-paced.</p>\r\nSounds:\r\n<p><strong>All Music:</strong>\u00a0http://www.abstractionmusic.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Most Sound Effects:</strong> https://www.zapsplat.com/</p>\n<p>0ther sound effects made with:\u00a0https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T16:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a0bf7d064370f1b46759e530626a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
