The goal is to allow users to check out, but also view the ships in VR. Though VR is currently not implemented, it is definitely coming (hopefully very soon).\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of now only the Origin 600i and Origin 400i are available for download. More ships will be added. If you want a specific ship to be added, feel free to contact me by leaving a comment, or sending me an email. Please note that bigger ships take longer to create.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you might get stuck, this is because the collision shapes are generated from the complex geometry. For this I added a no-clip. If you hit Q it will disable collision and gravity, allowing you to get un-stuck.</p>\n<p>Please note that there will be bugs. If you find one, don't hesitate to contact me at lowsignalstudios@gmail.com, so that I can fix it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07229398266ba3a4a2f1311d0f92759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wouterb14"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
