Build up the combo meter to score more points until there is no more room to move.</p><p>I might explore this idea further in the future when I have more experience with Unity and modelling. I would hope to add:</p><p>- A larger and more dynamic spawn system for the NPCs</p><p>- Models for the player and NPCs.</p><p>- Update the levels to be more vibrant and varied.</p><p>- At least one more level</p><p>I would love some feedback on what you think of the concept. Anything at all</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T04:51:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f72d2c20c39964984af24defcccde6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Sonneveld"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
