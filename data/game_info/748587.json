{"id": 748587, "slug": "scp-vacation", "name": "SCP: Vacation", "name_original": "SCP: Vacation", "description": "Four D-Class personnel awaken to find themselves in a mysterious dimension. Somehow, they know they must avoid the anomalous threats contained by the SCP Foundation and escape before it's too late...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOverview:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1-4 Players start on a board with various tiles that lead to an escape. <br/>\r\nPlayers take turn rolling a die to determine how far they can move along the board.<br/>\r\nPlayers must navigate the board while avoiding deadly anomalous threats.<br/>\r\nCertain SCPs will also be navigating the board, and must be considered when moving around.<br/>\r\nTiles have unique effects that trigger: when arrived at, when left from, when landed on, and when died on. Some of these give Evidence Points (EP).<br/>\r\nOnce a player escapes, their EP will be converted to Credits ($C), but if a player dies their EP is reset.<br/>\r\nAfter Everyone has moved, a minigame will be played which will reward $C based on performance.<br/>\r\nAll non-player slots will be filled with immersive AI that compete as a real player would.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Board:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe 'Board' refers to the map that players will navigate. There is 1 board in the current release and more planned. Boards vary in theme, meaning different boards will have different visual and audio queues. Boards will also have at least 1 mechanic that alters the gameplay as the game is played.<br/>\r\nThe current board is called 'Meadows', and presents a bright, friendly environment which lulls visitors into a certain sense of security.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Tiles:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs players navigate the board, they will land on 'Tiles'. Tiles have various effects, and are mainly used as a way to gain EP. Some tiles are owned by certain SCPs, such as the 106 tile in the Early Access version. This tile, for example, changes location at the start of every round, and if landed on will result in the players death. More of these are planned for full release.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemies:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers navigate the board during their 'turn', but while it isn't their turn some SCPs will also navigate the board. 173, the board enemy in this release, will walk around the board at the start of the round, and will initiate a short minigame with any player who is on the same tile as it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvidence Points:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs players navigate the board they find 'evidence'. These pieces of evidence have points assigned which refer to their value. Upon escaping, the player will be compensated in $Credits depending on their EP.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits are the main currency of the game. Total credits earned will determine who wins the game. They can also be spent on character customisation (not yet implemented)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMinigames: (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMinigames are short scenarios where players compete for a $C reward. The current minigames are all 1v1v1v1. The gameplay of minigames is varied, with present minigames like '860', where players must play an infinite runner style minigame, or '173' which is similar to red light green light.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T03:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c9050bc317c25ac34f23c5936cca7aa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeaPro"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["PeaPro"], "esrb_rating": null}
