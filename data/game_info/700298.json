Find hidden secrets in strange places that you wouldn't normally look. A whole cast of strange enemies awaits for you to\u00a0murder see around the 3 available levels in the demo. Also, there's a dance party filled with dancers submitted by the community to gawk at!</p>\n<p>This is what BogusGame and the Stupid Idea Test became after all this time. Essentially, BogusGame was a joke project for two friends back in 9th grade. Then, it later became Stupid Idea after I had an idea to make an open world platformer (open world never made it as you can see), which later became LouchGame after it spiraled into being my main project!</p>\n<p><em>(The game isn't done yet, so things can change from now until release!)</em></p>\n\n<p>Here are some links related to the game:</p>\n<p>LouchGame Discord Server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/vSdD8eFEvZ</p>\n<p>The OST Playlist:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMPYO-YjwlNK7pct2uCx2HpUFvEjNafIv</p>\n<p>The Game's Trello Board:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/vcGczCIU/louchgame-trello</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5e30f7d57511911c296c0d2de3f2bd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thejabcoguy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
