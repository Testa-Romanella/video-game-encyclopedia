King Arthur is long gone, and Knights of the Round Table are in disarray. Guardian Menhirs, the only thing that makes it possible for humans to survive in this remote land, are going dark. Your village chose its best and brightest and sent them on an epic quest to reach Kamelot, find the Grail, and save the land.<br />\nYou were not among them.<br />\nThey\u2019ve never returned, and now it\u2019s your turn to lead a band of unlikely heroes, the only ones this land can still provide. These ordinary people set off far too late, under-equipped for the task ahead, and with little hope of success.<br />\nTainted Grail is a dark fantasy open-world RPG with fresh turn-based exploration and combat. It is based around deep, immersive story from one of the best and most innovative board games (biggest Kickstarter project of 2018!), but introduces a whole new experience crafted directly for PC.EVERY DECISION MATTERSTainted Grail is a deeply immersive experience that takes the best elements of RPG adventures and brings them to the next level through intricately branching storylines. Written by Krzysztof Piskorski, one of the best Polish fantasy writers, it will draw you right in and keep you engaged, surprised, and invested in many secrets of Avalon.<br />\nIn this dying world, no decision is easy or morally obvious, and you will often face impossible choices. Other times, the consequences of seemingly minor actions will haunt you in the least expected moments. In the end, your impact on Avalon is going reverberate through deep, meaningful changes to the game world - entire towns will raise or fall, land will shatter, ancient powers will be restored, or broken forever.EXPLORE THE UNKNOWNA major part of the game involves expeditions into the land covered by the Wyrdness, an ancient force twisting people, creatures, and even space itself in all manner of ways .There will be plenty of enemies and weird, unexpected events waiting for you. While dangerous, exploration will be the only way to gather precious resources and, ultimately, to figure out what is happening to Avalon and if it can be stopped.STRATEGIC COMBATDuring combat, you will decide between using skills specific for your hero and figuring out the best possible combinations to do it. Every hero will bring a different playstyle, defined by unique skills, that you will continue to further develop based on your favorite tactic. You will supplement this rich toolset with various items and special moves. All of that makes every encounter a different and exciting tactical challenge!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-11T20:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/886b93be974c55838208d73915fb4671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 54, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 541, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Awaken Realms Digital", "Questline"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms Digital", "Awaken Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
