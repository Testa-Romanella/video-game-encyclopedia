Unfortunately, that's not easy when managing a group projects. Time to schedule group meetings, get to know the group, and maybe have a few nightmares along the way. <br/><br/>Group Project Simulator is a visual novel that simulates being in a group project. You may recognize your group members from projects you've been on- the procrastinator, the micromanager, the guy who's always sleeping in class... It's your job to keep them on track. Congratulations!<br/><br/>You choose who you want to spend time with and what part of the project needs your help. Do you spend all week with Alyssa and trust Ed to get the paper done? Do you check on everyone to make sure they're all doing their part? Or, do you decide to sleep all week and leave your grade completely up in the air? It's up to you! Each playthrough takes about 15 minutes, letting you chunk this game in between any actual group project you may be procrastinating on. Try different routes, get to know your group, and ace the class! Or fail! It's up to you.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>5 Minigames <br/></li><li>5 Major Different Routes <br/></li><li>Humor <br/></li><li>Achievements <br/></li><li>3 Project Topics <br/></li><li>Cats <br/></li><li>Original Music Tracks <br/></li><li>Free</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T11:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a49940ce3e3cc436e7b15bc101c017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meowstro Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Mariah Armstrong"], "esrb_rating": null}
