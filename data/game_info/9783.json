From the position of the sun in the sky down to the weather conditions. <br/><br/>Very soon the Simulator will have a gaming component, where the player has to maintain the house as cheaply as possible and upgrade the house as money permits adding fun and teaching to how power is used in a real home. <br/><br/>We hope you will join us on the journey and help us create a useful informational VR experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/930f709df2940b9777dfd84064440166.jpg", "website": "http://www.HomeTechVR.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["360 Evolve VR"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["360 Evolve VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
