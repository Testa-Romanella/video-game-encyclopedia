The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. <br/><br/>The rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku, since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. \u00a9<br/><br/><ul><li> 100 challenging Sudoku Jigsaw puzzles<br/></li><li> Level's progress save<br/></li><li> Beautiful minimalist design, multiple pleasing color themes<br/></li><li> 10 ambient relaxing soundtracks<br/></li><li> Steam Achievements<br/></li><li> Trading Cards, Badge, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Coming soon)<br/></li><li> Steam Cloud support<br/></li><li> Enjoy on Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T08:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b272abc1f413ed1a576ea15e5b274d.jpg", "website": "https://www.konstructors.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 56, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Konstructors Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Konstructors Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
