Each space on the mega grid has a mini-grid within it.<br/></p>\n<p>Your goal: claim one of the mini-grids to win the ENTIRE game!</p>\n<p>As the first move, Player 1 can place their star on any of the 81 squares. Player 2 will then be forced to place their star on the mini-grid that corresponds to Player 1\u2019s previous move. For Player 1\u2019s next turn, they are forced to play in the corresponding grid to Player 2\u2019s previous move.</p>\n<p>Check the dot in the scoreboard to see whose turn it is. Click on player icons at the beginning of the game to select which player starts first.</p>\n<p>To win a mini-game, make a row of three, just like Tic Tac Toe. Win on any ONE of the mini-grids and win the ENTIRE game!</p>\n\n<p>Citation Document:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rh6ECiquk_yLej47maBLekCeE2NsL-HZ_LWGuG9PmkA/...\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T10:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f1790ab5d2eafde14dc7f12c1dd583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Megan Duong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
