The game was a series of levels each containing a different puzzle related to <strong>gravity</strong>. Our character must be able to walk on all surfaces.

I just want to keep track of my research and make it easily accessible.\r\n\r\nIn programming there is not much except teleportation between levels and the beginning of walking on the walls.\r\nIf you want to try wall walking, go to the \"labyrinth\" level and you can walk on all the white walls\r\n<p>Blueprint programming in UE4</p><p>Changing the gravity could have been easier by modifying the source code directly, but unfortunately my current C++ skills don't allow me to go that far.</p><p>So we have an effect of \"alternating gravity\" by being able to walk on vertical walls, but to walk freely on the walls by the change of gravity or the directional gravity could not be done</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/367703bac3d42099b67f21223dae0cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphael Lecocq"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
