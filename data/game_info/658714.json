The story is related to Ancient Egyptian history and myths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game's story:</p>\n<p>God Seth has stolen the Grand Golden Palette that keeps the museum ready for the preparation of its great opening. When he made this, the statue of Ramesses II, standing at the entrance of the museum to welcome the museum's visitors, collapsed and broken down into six pieces, as it was found upon its discovery. Seth made this because he did not wish to remain forever in the museum, so he distributed the ten pieces of the golden palette in boxes in different places inside the museum so that no one can find them, in addition, he cursed the museum with a Pharaonic curse which prevents other Egyptian Gods from finding these pieces and thus he can escape and take what he wants from the museum to return and rule Egypt like the old days, but in the meantime, someone enters the museum, but get shocked when finding the collapsed statue of Ramesses II, then he finds God Anubis, the protector of the tomb, calling him, and telling him that Seth had stolen the main golden palette that keeps the museum flourished, and then handed him Tutankhamun's mask to protect him through his journey while searching for the golden palette.</p>\n<p>The golden palette consists of ten pieces, the main piece that has a shape similar to the shape of the museum\u2019s logo to emphasize the brand\u2019s features, and nine other pieces. Each piece of the golden palette has a hieroglyphic symbol, these symbols form a word that when translated into the Arabic language - the main language in Egypt - means the fourth pyramid, which is the word that describes the Grand Egyptian Museum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only by returning this golden palette can the museum return to what it was and the great opening of it shall happen. The player needs to help Anubis and the Egyptian Gods to find the Golden palette so that they can show the people around the world the Egyptian greatness, and on the way, he/she should try to collect the largest possible number of golden coins that contain the symbols of statues that moved from their places because of Set\u2019s curse that hit the museum when the golden palette was stolen. Only those who can collect the largest possible number of statues in addition to all pieces of the golden palette can get a free ticket to visit the Grand Egyptian Museum to see this greatness that they saved themselves.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f8f2a7717491fac65330460aa43abf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["esraa_kasem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
