Dive into the eerie atmosphere of the village and its inhabitants, and uncover the truth behind the apparent normality.</p>\n<p>Think you have seen everything? Try again.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>The game uses the four directional keys to move; hold the Shift key while moving to run faster.</li><li>Spacebar/Enter keys are used to interact.</li><li>Use the Escape key to open the ingame menu or cancel certain actions.</li><li>Alt+Enter switches between windowed and fullscreen modes.</li><li>F1 key opens an options dialog.</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The goal is to solve the crime. To do that, you must gather information taking testimony and analyzing evidences. Walk towards the person or item you want to interact with, and use the action button.</p>\n<p>When talking to people, sometimes you'll be presented with different options. <br/>There are two kind of options: mandatory and optional.</p>\n<ul><li>Mandatory options can't be skipped, and only one of them can be picked during a single game run. In other words: they are mutually exclusive.</li><li>Optional choices, on the other hand, can be skipped, either pressing the Escape key or picking \"...\" when presented with one. If you don't want to ask about it, or prefer to ask later, you can do it.</li></ul>\n<p>Note most things are limited to a certain time frame. Chances are they won't be there tomorrow.</p>\n<p>If you want to save your progress, just open the ingame menu hitting the Escape key (when not involved in a talk with other character), and select \"Save game.\" You can restore your progress at that point from the option \"Continue\" at the title screen.</p>\r\nTips for a fast playthrough\r\n<p><strong>Warning: THERE BE (MILD) SPOILERS! Select the text below to read it.</strong></p>\n<p>The game is quite rich in options and additional information. It also features three different endings, inviting players to investigate everything and trying different dialog options. However, certain parts can be tedious during second runs. Here are some tips to do blazingly fast runs:</p>\n<ul><li>Wilhelm is quite good estimating times and durations.</li><li>If you have very little time, you can skip certain parts when Wilhelm says he has enough information, so go get some rest ASAP.</li><li>Run. Really, don't lift your finger from the Shift key while playing.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\nProgramming and Graphics:\r\n<p>Jes\u00fas Alonso Abad</p>\r\nStory and Screenplay:\r\n<p>Javier L\u00f3pez Cerezo.</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks to:\r\n<ul><li>Alejandro Cu\u00f1ado Hernando</li><li>Andrea Garc\u00eda Nincehelser</li><li>Bel\u00e9n Prada \u00c1lvarez-Buylla</li><li>Beatriz Rubio Prada</li><li>Rodrigo Saavedra Pardo</li><li>Marcos Tejado Chocano</li></ul>\r\n3rd Party Resources used:\r\nSound effects\r\n<ul><li>Rain heavy 2 (rural), by jmbphilmes; https://www.freesound.org/people/jmbphilmes/sounds/200272/ ; Released under a CC0 license.
