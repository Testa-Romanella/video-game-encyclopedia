Once it reaches it, <em>oxygen </em>is sent back in exchange.<br/>The <em>Explorers </em>can also use the many <em>Food Boxes </em>left outside by the <em>Colony</em>.<br/>Once the <em>Explorer </em>dies, the <em>Player </em>is sent back to the <em>Colony</em>, a new <em>Explorer </em>is generated and the <em>Player </em>can spend the resources collected in the previous games in exchange of permanent upgrades.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls </strong>:<br/>* Tap around the Explorer to make him move, climb or jump down (Climbing cost more but give you a bigger view distance).<br/>* When next to a Food Box or a Green Crystal, tap in its direction to collect it.<br/>* Tap on the Explorer to ask the Colony for a pull back, so that you do not get stuck somewhere bad (It has a big Oxygen cost in the other hand).</p>\n<p><strong>Made by :</strong><br/>* Constantin Li\u00e9tard - Programming / Shaders / UI / Sound - 40h<br/>* Clara Coolen - Rigging / Animation - 17h<br/>* Tanguy Gringoire - Environment / Upgrade icons - 7h<br/>* Thomas Denis - Characters / VFX - 6h</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002c543e908d95baf57ea1d4aa8a269f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Borderline Games", "Constantin Li\u00e9tard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
