You are a special agent who will infiltrate, sabotage and steal important documents from rival corporations. But first, you must pass the special agent training program.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0The Gameplay -\u00a0</strong><br/>The essence of the game is a fast-paced platformer. You can double jump, air dash, slide, wall run and you can chain them together for an awesome sequence while avoiding danger. The main point of this level is to collect digital currency, avoid traps and get to the exit. The level is technically a training stage so you shouldn't have much trouble getting to the end as the game will give you advice at every checkpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0The Point -\u00a0</strong><br/>This is a training mission from a larger game I am working on. Before I can continue I need your help. Feedback and constructive criticism is very important for the development of a good project. The game is free so feel free to download it and tell me your honest impressions. Please share in the comments what you liked, loved and hated about it.</p>\n<p><strong>- Special Credit -\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I would like to thank the following people for their hard work regarding the Music and Sound Effects I used in this project.</p>\n<p>Xmuzic<br/>KevanGc<br/>Bobthedestroyer<br/>pindatjuh<br/>Sir Shire<br/>Chas3r</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:04:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66a302070c42fe37061669a339227696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Anderson"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
