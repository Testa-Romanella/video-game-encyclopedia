But before you would reach your destination, something goes wrong and you have to gather information about what happened while discovering more about yourself, your crew and your ship.<br/><br/><strong>SENSE POINTS (SP)</strong><br/><br/>Try to keep your mind calm and healthy: the more sense points you have, the better, if it reaches zero, you lose your sanity and the game is over.<br/><br/><strong>SCORE</strong><br/><br/>For certain actions, you gain scores and in the end, you will see how many more you could have got. Aim for the highest and check everything!<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS AND OPTIONS</strong><br/><br/>Arrow keys or left click to move, space bar or left click to interact. Press Esc for the inventory and character screen and to save your game! To always run, press Esc and enable Always Dash in the Options! You can also set volume for sound effects, music etc. under Options. Controllers should be OK but I could only do limited testing, therefore the partial support only.<br/><br/><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE CREATOR</strong><br/><br/>This is an old project of mine, created entirely by me and now released it here. I wish I had more resources and money to make it better and prettier - please accept the game as is, expect no further updates. Originally planned to make a much larger game but quickly realized I would never finish it. So let me offer you this short but complete game, I hope despite its shortcomings, you will enjoy playing it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T04:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a540d275e56e30c3f4c2e9bac0055a85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroVem"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RetroVem"], "esrb_rating": null}
