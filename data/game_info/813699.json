The player's job is to manage and serve as the AI's enforcer when the worker's productivity and efficiency drop or any other issue arises. <br/></p><p>The game is a first-person managerial game with a heavy emphasis on the activist message: the warehouse corporation designed the AI to maximise the profit and efficiency of the workers, uncaring about their welfare and basic needs. <br/></p><p>The activist component of the game comes when the player has to decide how to react to the AI demands and treat the employees.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T06:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4c0de8de813aecf49148a5905952a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Filippo Casola"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
