In order to survive you must <strong>collect green diamonds</strong> to grow and avoid death by implosion. <br/>\r\n\tUnfortunately the world does not help you.. Moving blocks, spikes, \r\n\t<strong>everything wants to kill you in SHRiNK! </strong><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tUse the \r\n\t<strong>RIGHT</strong> and <strong>LEFT</strong> arrows to move <br/>\r\n\tPress R to restart a level \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>Short Post Mortem:<p>\r\n\t\tIt was my second Ludum Dare and i'm quite happy with what I've done. I started a bit late so I had to find a simple idea to make it work. I had a lot of crazy ideas but it would have been too much work and I wouldn't have finished in time. So I focused on a really simple gameplay. Only two buttons to control the player and a cool shrinking/growing mechanic. My idea was clearly in the theme :D Everything worked just fine, and I finally finished way earlier than expected. The only bugs you'll probably encounter are related with the changing size of the player that makes some collisions weird but it won't be a big deal I hope :)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\tI hope you'll enjoy!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong><p>\n<strong> </strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Windows:</strong> The game may be blocked by Windows, so if you can't open it : <br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\tRight click on SHRiNK.exe &gt; Properties &gt; Check \"Unblock\" and it should run just fine! If it doesn't, maybe your antivirus is blocking it :/\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Mac: </strong>If osx tells you something like 'Downloaded .app is damaged and can't be opened, you should move it to trash', just open a terminal and go to the app folder (doing cd Downloads for example) and then type: <br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\txattr -d com.apple.quarantine SHRiNK.app\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Linux: </strong>Also this is the first time I've done a Linux export, so I hope it works ok.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\tDon't hesitate to tell me if anything goes wrong.\r\n\t\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08c/08ce6f1a9145a3e45e4cc7ac1319fb8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Quentin Kergu\u00e9len"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
