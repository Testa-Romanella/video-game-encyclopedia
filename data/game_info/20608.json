Are you suspicious of success? Do you smile at the thought of \"accidental\" electrocution? Then boy have we got the game for you!<br/><br/>Introducing Cute Things Dying Violently, a game where nothing bad happens. CTDV is all about hapless Critters, and the Critters need your help! Launch them around to get them safely out of each level. Dodge all sorts of lethal goodies like spikes, buzzsaws, and fire, and use a variety of wacky items to pull it off. And if a few dozen (or hundred) of them get turned into charred, smoking husks in your attempt to save them... something something omelettes and broken eggs. Broken, bloody eggs.<br/><br/>Featuring:<br/><ul><li>48 mind-bending, reflex-testing singleplayer levels<br/></li><li>New Levels of the Week<br/></li><li>24 Achievements<br/></li><li>Built-in Level Editor<br/></li><li>Steam Workshop integration for sharing user-created levels and custom Critter designs<br/></li><li>Free Android copy of the game included<br/></li><li>A murderous, bucket-headed robot</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e87387193106a779bd015166f58e18fb.jpg", "website": "http://www.apathyworks.com/games/cute-things-dying-violently/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 65, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["ApathyWorks"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["ApathyWorks"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
