{"id": 771229, "slug": "princess-unwed", "name": "Princess: Unwed", "name_original": "Princess: Unwed", "description": "<p>In Princess: Unwed, you play a medieval princess desperate to get out of marrying before she's ready. Her mother, however, has other plans. You must conduct investigations to dig up dirt on the eligible bachelors the Queen betroths you to, in order to convince her to call off the arranged marriage!\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it turns out, one weekend isn't much time for extensive playtesting, so the game CAN be pretty tough to figure out with just the in-game help screen information. Here's a bit more guidance:</p>\n<p>1. Full geographical info on all Kingdoms is on the map by the door to the Queen's chamber.</p>\n<p>2. Full information on the possible suitor character traits is in the book on the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Partial kingdom crest information is available on the loose pages on the table. The rest must be deduced through clues.</p>\n<p>4. NO kingdom alliance information is available, but it too can be deduced through clues.</p>\n<p>5. Only sending out Miss Pidgie takes any time, and time resets when you dodge a suitor by successfully accusing him of bad traits to the queen. So it's best to use all turns (weeks) gathering information before making your accusations.</p>\n<p>6. Clues you've gained can be reviewed via the single page in the middle of the table (appears after getting your 1st clue).</p>\n<p>7. You can only send Miss Pidgie to each recipient of a kingdom once (until you are investigating a new suitor).</p>\n<p>8. The Ambassador is weighted to give political (crest/alliance) clues. The Surveyor is weighted towards geographical. The Merchant is in the middle. The Duchess has a higher chance of including a clue about the suitor's traits. (truthfully, probably just \"visit\" all of them though).</p>\n<p>9. Traits are good, kinda bad, or terrible. Good traits can't be accused. It takes correctly accusing 2 kinda bad traits or 1 terrible trait to disqualify suitor.</p>\n<p>10. I've put in a semi-spoilery chart below explaining the trait arrangement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>11. I've included a definitely spoilery chart below will ALL the kingdom data.</p>\n<p>12. You get less time and the suitors are less guaranteed to have bad traits the more you disqualify. Some RNG involved.</p>\n<p>13. I should have included a \"suitors dodged\" counter in the UI. If you dodge 10 suitors, you win! I guess some things aren't _entirely_ inevitable :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T18:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a449c9bce5ed4fa3506a96551b032410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["saintchristopher777"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
