{"id": 3238, "slug": "fortified", "name": "Fortified", "name_original": "Fortified", "description": "<p>While the Cold War did not turn into a real war, the Earthmen are invited to fight with the Martians - with all the arsenal of the Cold War and several experimental technologies.</p>\n<h3>Synthesis of genres</h3>\n<p>The game achieved a productive blending of several genres - the third-person shooter, real-time strategy, and tower defense.</p>\n<p>From the genre of strategy into the game came the need to build a network of defensive structures capable of resisting the pressure of mechanical invaders. From the genre of the shooter from the third person the game took a powerful action in the entourage of several visual styles - comics of the 50&#39;s, neon lights of the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, cold dynamics of the 00&#39;s. Much in the design of locations is a quote or allusions to famous works of science fiction of the fifties.</p>\n<h3>Instead of the invasion of the Reds, an invasion from the Red Planet</h3>\n<p>Mars invades the US with its iconic 50s-styled flying saucers, insectoid drones, various robots in the size of a skyscraper, rolling balls that turn into death machines on stilts, floating bombs, iconic 50&#39;s-styled flying saucers. The aliens are rolling in waves, from different directions.</p>\n<h3>Sci-Fi archetypes</h3>\n<p>Characters that can be played correspond to the chosen style of pulp-sci-fi, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.</p>\n<p>You can play on behalf of one of the characters, but you can also unite with others, and this will give the most guaranteed victory.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>You can fight in different ways - attack the aliens, personally shooting them, or building a network of defensive structures. When building, you can use money, sell unnecessary.</p>\n<p>You can alternate the way of action - to run and shoot, and then to build something and so on. Of course, in this situation, there is no time for deep strategic calculations, so the strategic part of the game is not as elaborate as in the games of the strategic genre itself.</p>\n<p>The canon of the genre tower defense is presented in the game much more fully - there are quite useful tools, a great variety of units. For defense with weapons, the player has the soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades, gun turrets, weapons that freeze and fire the enemies and so forth.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2016-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T14:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4dfcdfccc02b4a5bab50d677f038269b.jpg", "website": "http://www.fortifiedgame.com", "rating": 2.11, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 122, "owned": 1752, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 36}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 53, "ratings_count": 126, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 126, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Clapfoot"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clapfoot"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
