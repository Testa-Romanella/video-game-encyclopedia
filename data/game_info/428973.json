Your goal seems simple at first but in later levels, you meet many different obstacles. One of these obstacles is rotating saws that move and you need to avoid them. You will also meet shooting turrets that fire bullets that you need to dodge. Traverse the levels by jumping on moving platforms, disappearing platforms, platforms that only let you jump on them for specific times. Later on, all these gameplay mechanics will be combined to make the higher levels even more challenging.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d7996c35877c12dde934417b275fefc.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
