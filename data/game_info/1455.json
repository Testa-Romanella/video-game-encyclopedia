In it you can choose from three distinct classes, each with their own combat style. <br/><br/>The Blade Master: <br/>A duel wielding melee specialist. He survives by clearing swathes of enemies with each of his mighty strikes. He has devastating special moves which skillful players will be able to use to decimate their foes. <br/><br/>The Dark Ranger. <br/>A deadly archer who can summon waves of arrows that bounce, seek and split. Perforate your enemies with dense walls of arrowy death. <br/><br/>The Battle Mage <br/>A powerful, but fragile, nuker who controls the forces of fire, ethereal, ice and lightning to obliterate groups of enemies. Charge up her spells to critical levels and unleash maximum destruction. <br/><br/>Each quest in Pocket RPG is a new adventure. The hero starts at level zero with an empty sachel and collects items and rapidly builds their strength to dizzying proportions. Pocket RPG is not a \"my numbers beat your numbers\" game.
