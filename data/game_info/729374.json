Players are prompted to read again in peace with the constant challenge of reality mitigated by the format.  Modern distracting stimuli remagnetize back towards the reader's inquiry, because of how these pages are designed and coded onto a stabilized, focus page that guarantees a returning bookmark, including a small click noise when turning a page.  Achievements are self-reinforced by reading further, a new concept, thus the title Plum Bun Reformatted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe originally published 1928 novel was written by Jessie Redmon Fauset.
