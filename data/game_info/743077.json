Every game studio / indie developer can showcase their game in a virtual retro arcade machine in the Arcade City. Hence, it will create \"build-first\" mentality which will make P2E gaming space more mature.</p>\n<p>Follow our\u00a0<strong>Twitter</strong>\u00a0@IsekaiLand\u00a0and join the revolution!\u00a0WAGMI\u00a0\ud83d\ude80<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee1f5ecacbc96dc04d060878b21fc73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["isekailand"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
