Unfortunately, the curse works fast upon you, and the only way to escape the power of the Dutchman is to pierce the heart of its Captain. The crew will die, but the one who takes it will be set free.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI seen it, with me own six eyes. The Dutchman, she run more silent than a Porassian Longship. Don\u2019t let her rusty exterior fool ye. She do be filled by haunts aplenty. If ye find yerself aboard, None be seeing ye again\u2026 Least, not as yerself, ye see. Them poor trapped souls be cryin\u2019 in flesh rapt by the cosmic tides. Changed to horror, by the Dutchman\u2019s curse, and Davy himself ain\u2019t no better off, cursed to search for his impossible love, for what poor woman could love such a man.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Yar, I seen it, and I won\u2019t be talkin\u2019 no more, so heed me last, boy. That vast sea be perilous for a man alone. If ye find yerself out there when the asteroid tides roll in, ye never know who do be searchin\u2019 for ye, or who might mistake ye for something ye ain\u2019t. Perilous indeed...\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>Tale last told by a sailor aboard the Shanty L03, an unlicensed scrap vessel before the ship was rent asunder, and the crew tossed into the vast belt with only their suits for comfort.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Lead Programming - Samuel \"Orionhart\" Reinhart and Nick \"Infernis\"</p>\n<p>Level Design and Balancing - JT Manning</p>\n<p>Models, Icons and Textures - Joe</p>\n<p>Models,\u00a0Animation and Rigging - Austin Piko</p>\n<p>Music and SFX - Mark Bondar</p>\n<p>Voice Lines - Samuel \"Orionhart\" Reinhart</p>\n\n<p>All main assets, excluding Shaders, were designed, coded and completed in one week from scratch.</p>\n<p>I am personally the most impressed with how far we were able to push ourselves.
