Different figures invoke different creatures. Change the number on the top left side to define the amount of candles. If you toggle the T-Pose, you can see way better how different the creatures are.</p><p>This small prototype is basically to test some procedural creature generation techniques - which makes me wish this was a space game just so I could call it \"Poor Man's Sky\".</p><p>Will probably do a writeup about it in the next few weeks.<br/></p><p>[UPDATES]</p><p>05/11/2016 - Welp that took a while. Added a windows binary pack. Sorry everyone I promised that to months ago!</p><p>21/03 - Added toggle for T-Pose. Note to self: next time you change everything in a character, make sure its animation actually SHOWS stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9baf4ac7005bc74de02d75ebf96cce2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Yanko Oliveira"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
