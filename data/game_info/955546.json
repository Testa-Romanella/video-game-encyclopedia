The idea is simple, collect all the diamonds without exploding. Movement works by rotating left and right and then applying thrust, that's it.<br/><br/>As you progress you'll meet the six different styles of enemies:<h3>Level 1</h3><br/>No enemies, just get used to the controls (left and right to spin, action button to fire thrusters).<br/><h3>Level 2</h3><br/>Asteroids, these won't kill you but they will deplete your score - sometimes they blow up. Just get used to avoiding enemies without any pressure.<br/><h3>Level 3</h3><br/>Wanderers, these will just mill around the screen, they aren't especially dangerous but you will blow up if you hit them.<br/><h3>Level 4</h3><br/>Miners wander around the screen and drop mines. These are both hard to see and deadly.<br/><ul><li>The Miner dropping a mine <br/></li><li>A disabled mine, safe to hit   <br/></li><li>An enabled mine, careful, hot <br/></li></ul><h3>Level 5</h3><br/>Hunters will come straight for you, fortunately they have to live in the same physics model as you do so they can't turn around quickly.<br/><h3>Level 6</h3><br/>Shooters will try to get into firing distance quickly and then shoot at you. The bullets they use don't have massive range but they do bounce off of things.<br/><h3>Level 7</h3><br/>Laserers have, um, lasers. Like the Shooters they'll try to get into firing range quickly. The Laser is absolutely deadly and never misses, but it does have a short range and takes a while to recharge.<br/><br/><br/>After Level 7 there will be a mixed bag of rest of the enemies - up to 11, after that it's a more random assortment.<h3>Time</h3><br/>Every level (up to 11) keeps track of your time and compares it to previous runs<h3>Options</h3><br/><strong>Skip training levels</strong><br/><br/>This option will start on level 3, after the basic training levels<br/><br/><strong>Speedrun mode</strong><br/><br/>This will keep track of your entire game time, finish the game at level 11 and show your play metrics. Note, this will also turn off Skip training levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T04:32:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a432f8ba030522e6001069c7829ec51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Johnny Blanchard"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tonsomo Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
