So I made a duck model and a basic map and hoped the game would arrive in the process. Unforuntately, I don't think it did, but given more time I think there's something here. I'd like to add some zycoon dynamics and have bread as a currency. If I had a few more days I'd have implemented human pond visitors that would throw bread, and then added optional clothing accessories to ducks could would to further impress for more bread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f72372affcf14f60d634b11d2955023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RichTeaMan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
