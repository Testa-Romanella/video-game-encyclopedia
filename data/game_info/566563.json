Chicken Invaders is the most successful chicken game of this millennium (not to mention the previous one). The game puts you at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. <br/><br/>In <strong>Chicken Invaders Universe</strong>, you assume the role of a new recruit in the <strong>United Hero Force</strong> (UHF), mankind's last hope against the fowl <strong>Henpire</strong>. You start your UHF career deployed in some backwater galactic star system, and it's up to you to advance through UHF ranks and earn your place in the honorary annals of <strong>Heroes Academy</strong>. Travel across the galaxy, explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and exterminate any Henpire forces that cross your path. And do so in style.<h3>NEW IN THIS GAME</h3><br/><ul><li> 1,000+ star systems to explore<br/></li><li> 20,000+ missions to fly<br/></li><li> Choose from 15 unique mission types<br/></li><li> Participate in competitive challenge missions delivered to your inbox daily<br/></li><li> Buy, sell, and upgrade your equipment<br/></li><li> Join squadrons with your fellow UHF recruits<br/></li><li> Comprehensive leaderboards and rankings<br/></li><li> Fully customizable fleet of spacecraft </li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li> Finger-blistering shooting action with over 200 chickens on-screen simultaneously<br/></li><li> Gigantic boss fights<br/></li><li> Discover 15 awesome weapons, each upgradeable to 11 levels (plus a secret 12th!)<br/></li><li> Collect 30 unique bonuses and 40 medals on your way to glory<br/></li><li> Breathtaking graphics and original orchestral soundtrack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T04:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47517dec980170cee8d2f7c7d950eef.jpg", "website": "https://chickeninvaders.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 105, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InterAction studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["InterAction studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
