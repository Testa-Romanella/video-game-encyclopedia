Attempted to challenge myself by making a fnaf game with the free version of construct 3, in which I am limited to 40 lines of code. This was the result. The game was made over the course of less than 24 hours so I am actually pretty proud that I was able to figure this out in that little time. \u00a0Actual Sprites coming soon. Feedback very welcome... please.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Pressing Down Space - Looking at Cameras</p>\n<p>Tap A - Close/Open Right door</p>\n<p>Tap D - Close/Open Left door</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T11:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/522/5221ac2db12ad2619074fea36da2389a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lukewarm Tea"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
