You were originally going to befriend Kay to keep up with the tradition of GP protagonists having a bat sidekick, but that was cut due to time constraints, which is why you never actually meet him.</p>\n<p>The game served as a prototype for many systems I later deployed in other games, such as using an assembly-like language for cutscenes so that cutscenes could be scripted on the fly in the level editor without needing any fancy tools, and using menu objects that get assigned scripts instead of IDs for a switch statement.</p>\n<p>Do you feel like this game is awesome and you wish you could make something as good? I'm selling the source code of the latest version! Includes all scripts, graphics, sounds, rooms and objects! The only thing that isn't included is fonts, due to technical reasons and due to me not having the rights to sell them.</p>\n<p>You can use anything included in the source game commercially; credit appreciated but not necessary - you just can't resell any derivative work in an editable form, but feel free to sell movies and games and such haywire.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb4/eb4d6c32e0a6ae6606fb3f1cf8dd62aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
