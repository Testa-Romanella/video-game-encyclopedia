It tells the story of two siblings, Sympathy and Spite. Sympathy is nice. Spite, not so much.\u00a0You are a square. Don't worry about failing, Sympathy will respawn you if you die.</p>\n<p>What I had planned to include:</p>\n<ul><li>Five increasingly difficult levels</li><li>Witty dialogue from the siblings</li><li>Awesome voice acting for said dialogue</li><li>Expressions on Sympathy and Spite</li><li>Actual Graphics</li><li>Appealing Menu with level selection</li><li>Moving background</li><li>Hanging Platforms</li></ul>\n<p>What was actually implemented:</p>\n<ul><li>Two slightly buggy levels\u00a0(don't hold right at the beginning of the second level - you'll get softlocked and have to restart the entire game)\u00a0and an abrupt end screen</li><li>A few lines of possibly interesting dialogue</li><li>No voice acting whatsoever - only a death sound, level finish sound, and background music. (If you want to imagine sounds, Sympathy sounds like GLaDOS and Spite has a British accent.)</li><li>Expressionless eyes that are always staring at you</li><li>The same graphic for all platforms</li><li>A boring\u00a0super easy to navigate menu with only a Play button and a Quit button.</li><li>A dark, foreboding background that makes it look like you're being sucked into a bottomless pit full of bad or non-existent graphics</li><li>Mysterious floating platforms because Line Renderer refused to cooperate</li></ul>\n<p>My interpretation of the theme FAILURE IS PROGRESS:</p>\n<p>Sympathy is a being that helps you PROGRESS if you FAIL by either protecting you from the danger or giving you a way around it, if you show that you can't get past something on your own. This would have been more obvious if I was able to finish the three other levels :(</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:\u00a0The big red button is not part of the game.\u00a0It's my version of quit button because I didn't have time to make a pause menu.</p>\n<p>If you want to rate the game on anything, rate it on the menu music. Or the simplicity. Whichever you'd rate higher.</p>\n<p>I used Unity, Gimp, and BeepBox 3.0.13 to create the entire game. This is my first real game that I've actually tried to finish.</p>\n<p>I hope you had at least some amount of fun playing this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926f890cf221837b1580469986400054.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["quadblast24"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
