With those points, you can upgrade your dice (launch strength and roundness) to try to reach further.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the simple yet adictive games of repetition and point farming.</p>\n<p>It contains basic mechanics based on the time available during the jam. But they are good enough to grasp the gameplay loop:</p>\n<ol><li>Upgrades to the dice. Currently two, but this can be increased with new ideas, such as better throwing objects(instead of the cup), less friction surface...</li><li>Map with obstacles to surpass. Currently only one at the beginning to get the idea at early game.</li><li>Map with different levels. After certain upgrades we can get to the \"second level\" which is falling from the table to the ground. Currently the ground is empty, but allows to get the feeling of improvement.</li><li>Being able to increase the roundness of the dice, opens the door for more customization: materials, dot distribution, colors or even number of faces.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a11deb06e1ae47c39ede0984e6c264a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Magicdri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
