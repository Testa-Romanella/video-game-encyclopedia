Enemies will try to stop you. To stop them you set traps.\u00a0What happened if they reach you ? You become a hollow,\u00a0and you\u00a0have to pass through your own traps to\u00a0reach your dead body and revive.</p>\n<p>The game is in development. Now, I'm adding abilities to the different types of characters. Wizard Fire and Ice are in game. Not yet kunai and shield :/</p>\n<p>The theme is really not final! Difficult to imagine warriors and ninja looking for hollow earth :p But it was the simpliest way to try the core mechanics (platformer/Tower defense) with different patterns (strength, agility and\u00a0''shut up it's magic'' ...).</p>\n<p>I put this game on itchio to know what you think of the mechanics. And to imagine together a coherent universe.</p>\n<p>Control are simple :\u00a0</p>\n<p>ZQSD, sorry I'm\u00a0French :D I will try to change this (I mean controls not my nationality of course).</p>\n<p>Space to jump.</p>\n<p>Left mouse to use selected item (scroll to choose\u00a0item).</p>\n<p>Right mouse to use ability.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:51:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bf2652a74eb218a775b088787065f11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mad Jester"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
