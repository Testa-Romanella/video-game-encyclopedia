{"id": 62652, "slug": "secret-of-harrow-manor", "name": "Secret of Harrow Manor", "name_original": "Secret of Harrow Manor", "description": "Secret of Harrow Manor was created because I wanted to make a VR game in the survival horror genre that put you up against zombies and monsters in a creepy abandoned mansion setting similar to the games that inspired me so deeply when I was growing up. One where even an individual zombie was to be feared, and you needed to search the area for ammo and keys in order to make it out. Along the way you'll also find many documents to read that will slowly reveal the story of what happened at this mansion and what created the monsters in the first place.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231e290a21f43608fd13185ca8a922d9.jpg", "website": "http://www.onlyhumanstudios.net/secret-of-harrow-manor", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Only Human Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Only Human Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
