The core gameplay process is to try to combine the existing elements in the game, get more and more new elements, and ultimately reach the goal of clearing the level. The so-called \"elemental synthesis\" is just like combining \"human\" element and \"stone\" element , then they can be synthesized as  \"stone tools\" element, and then \"stone tools\" may be able to synthesize new elements with other elements, and so on. So if you want to clear the level, you also need to develop your own imagination to explore the level, and think and solve puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/842e2275eee2d1da79bcaae313e7b87a.jpg", "website": "http://histmaker.lofter.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duke Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Duke Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
