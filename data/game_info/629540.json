Sync your breathing to the environment\u00a0and see what you find!</p>\n<p>This prototype was developed in 48 hours for the\u00a02021 XR Brain Jam hosted by Games for Change\u00a0with the prompt \"Promoting Positive Mental Health.\"\u00a0The project won the laurel for <strong>\"Best Research Application.\"</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In our current prototype, we teach you a breathing technique called <strong>\"box breathing\"</strong>. It is a hypoxic breathing technique that helps oxygenate your blood and reduce carbon dioxide poisoning, which is a cause and symptom of stressed, shallow breathing.</p>\n<p>In the future,\u00a0this application can be customized further to incorporate variety of breathing techniques and environments, and can also be\u00a0implemented in clinical settings with the supervision of certified therapists to help patients reduce anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>Watch the <strong>demo </strong>below:</p>\n<p><em>Medical Disclaimer: This content is provided for information purposes only and is not intended as medical advice, or as a\u00a0substitute for the medical advice of a clinical therapist or physician.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Team 8: The Sunchasers</strong></p>\n<p>Sounak Ghosh (Producer and 3D Designer)</p>\n<p>Elena Chopyak (Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Responder)</p>\n<p>Jane Cocks (Psychology and Mental Health Researcher)</p>\n<p>Ursula Uday (Visual and Sound Designer)<br/></p>\n<p>Mercedes Hesselroth (Narrative Designer)<br/></p>\n<p>Daniela Mari\u00f1o (Interaction Developer)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The prototype is currently supported only on the Oculus Quest.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83b3567de4cd560e47a834c759a58e1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Team 8: The Sunchasers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
