With limited memory space.</p>\n<p>Travelling to Earth, your mission is to learn about various aspects of human life by blending in with the local species. You have a range of knowledge modules to get you through these encounters \u2013 but you won\u2019t be able to fit all of them into your memory.</p>\n<p>Drag and drop a range of Tetris-block shaped modules into your brain in order to try and get by on Earth, ranging from the topic of \u2018parents\u2019 to \u2018machetes\u2019. Use them to explore the joys of human life (going to the supermarket! Setting up a dating profile! Buying a bus ticket!
