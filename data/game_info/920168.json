With purely visual storytelling, our team tries to stay true to the classic tale by allowing the player to retrace the steps of the story through flash-inspired games of old. We hope you enjoy our colorful take of this wonderful myth with us!</p>\n<p>Gameplay video: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T08:29:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/6256998848e8bf4a061084e302fb50a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dazinga"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
