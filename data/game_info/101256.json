This is a sketch of an idea and an adventure into pico8 development for a first time pico8 and Lua newbie in order to get to grips with the platform. And have tried to design something that suits the limitations and complements Pico8.</p><p>The burning rose is a action shmup game of tense combo chaining and score driven gameplay. Coupled with end game resource management and survival. The session time is low, requiring little time investment for the player. I have tried to design a quick open ended scoring system for longevity, with the emphasis on maximization. One hit kills and quick restart make it ideal for one more go arcade style play. </p><p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p><p>Pilot the Burning Rose through a finite barrage of 500 missiles using only 500 of your own shots to cut a path. Each missile is worth one point. Destroying two missiles without a single missile leaving the screen starts a combo. Keep the chain going and your final score will be multiplied by your highest chain of your run. Push your chaining ability to the limit to make your way onto the local top pilot ranking! </p><p>In one run you're given 3 bombs. Use them defensively to get out of a tight situation and avoid death. Or use them aggressively to maintain a chain and link stray missiles. </p><p><strong>CONTROLS :</strong></p><p>Menus:</p><p>Z - Accept/select<br/>X - Back<br/>Arrows - navigate up and down</p><p>In Gameplay:</p><p>Z - Hold to fire<br/>X - Smart bomb<br/>Arrows - Movement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f4f0700a834ac0c33169e02a62ed15a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grandtraindelta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
