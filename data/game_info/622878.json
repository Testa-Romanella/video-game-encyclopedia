I still appreciate donations!\r\n\r\nIsekai Ga Kirai Desu\r\n<p><strong>Isekai Ga Kirai Desu - \u7570\u4e16\u754c\u304c\u304d\u3089\u3044\u3067\u3059</strong> is a <strong>single-player indie-game</strong>, it introduces <strong>Visual Novels, Adventure, RPG, and Free Roam</strong> All-In-One Genre: <strong>\"Visual RPG Adventure Novel.\"</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created by <strong>one developer,</strong> a developer who wanted to make <strong>a game that was completely free</strong> so people can just <strong>smile and enjoy it together</strong>, with <strong>no costs to play</strong> and no <strong>In-App Purchases.</strong></p>\r\nThe Game right now is something I would like to call \"Very Early Alpha<strong>\". By that I mean, there is content to view but not much, but there is wayyy more to come.</strong>\r\nWhat to Expect in the Future\r\n<p>This game was based on <strong>a few animes</strong> and <strong>a few games</strong> I'm sure you guys <strong>heard, played, or seen before.</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Konosuba</strong> was the main reference, <strong>Re:Zero</strong> is a small reference as well, \u00a0especially implementing <strong>Return By Death for respawning.</strong> I was unsure if this would be possible without copyright issues so I reached out to <strong>the Re:Zero Creator and Konosuba Creator,</strong> and that's how<strong> they became apart of the game development!</strong> Along with that, you can see many similar aspects in the game that will remind you of <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> for fighting and exploration, as well as <strong>Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald</strong>, when it comes to the world and map setup. <strong>Keep in mind</strong>, you can be <strong>free to do anything you want</strong> in the game that you could do in <strong>Konosuba.</strong> By that I mean, <strong>if you choose not to fight the boss and work on your relationship with a party member, be my guest.</strong></p>\n<p>One of the main concerns from you guys will probably be combat, <strong>how will it work? What type of combat will it be?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The combat will be simply like <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,</strong> you <strong>will not be forced into a battle screen</strong> phase and <strong>you are free to avoid battles</strong> if you want.</p>\n\r\nThe Very Long Story\r\n<p>I came up with the idea of this game about 2 years ago. At the time it was just a random thought that came through my head while watching Konosuba. Questions ran through my head like, what if I was in that situation, what if I could make Kazuma's decisions, could I do better? That led me to do what any person in my place would do...look up if a game like that exist. Yes, there is, Konosuba had a game for people to play but there was a huge problem. It was very hard to get your hands on, I tried but failed and eventually just asked myself if it was worth the struggle.</p>\n<p>I sat on my ass pretty disappointed I couldn't play it and then I remembered, I'm a programmer, I'll jump into it and see what I can do. At first, it was supposed to be a project to test my programming abilities after 5 years, and it eventually got to the point where so many ideas were running through my head so I wrote them all down in a notebook.</p>\n<p>So many ideas were scrapped and I was finally left with a simple idea of what I wanted and how I wanted to make it work. I decided to jump into programming without any real plan of what the heck I was gonna add, I only knew the basis. I unsurprisingly had to start writing MORE ideas in a notebook. I invented the MC after many sketches and even drew lots of characters, I didn't even design Heavenly yet. Originally, he was supposed to go to heaven and just have tons of catgirls with him, no personalities in either of them. I definitely had to scrap that idea and came up with Heavenly.</p>\n<p>I was finally going somewhere. Around this time, I hit a big speed bump and had all these ideas inspired by other animes like Re Zero, and Konosuba, we'll get to Demon Slayer later. At the time I didn't really care about taking these ideas since I was busy creating this basis, I'll change it later, right?</p>\n<p>Anyways, I once again jumped into programming with all these random, more organized ideas. At one point I got too attached to my character designs and drew them over and\u00a0over again and tried to make the assets of them. Some looked awful, some looked okay, so I just continued designing for about 6 months. I eventually drew some final products\u00a0of them but what I didn't know is that I wouldn't be adding them anytime soon since I had to start with the opening scene which was a real struggle.</p>\n<p>But that wasn't the biggest struggle I had. I knew there was something I couldn't do for this game so I knew I had to do something about that, I knew I had to pay people to do these things for me like compose music or what not. This was hard to do as I had school and didn't have time to go work and make money so the money I did have I didn't wanna spend on these people, I knew it would stack up overtime.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Thats when I though of making a Kickstarter project and fund the money. This was easier said then done, it started as me thinking up rewards for people but the big problem was when I got to the about section, I had to present many stuff to actually make people want to fund it, and I didn't have any of that, I only had drawings and writin which wasn't enough. I just had to scrap the Kickstarter idea and I still have the draft til this day waiting to be finished. So I decided to just continue and teach myself the things I didn't know which was easier said than done as well. Long story short, I learned little to nothing and just went back to what I had.</p>\n<p>I finally reached the part about implementing the ideas from Re Zero and Konosuba and I tried to think of a way to cover them up but it was no use. Then it came to me, why not contact these creators and ask them for permission. This was very hard, I'll spare you the story but I eventually got to talk to them. Around this time was the first time I was watching Demon Slayer so now I was bombarded with even more ideas to put in the game and after a few months I had to eventually, once again, take the train on trying to communicate with him.</p>\n<p>Now that I had there approval, I had to scrap every other project I had with this game and start\u00a0from scratch, I got really into it and finally had this basis which took many more months of programming while trying to balance school. Sometimes I would get uninterested but later would come back to the project. I'm here now and have finally created at least enough for an early alpha. And that's where this story ends, or should I say, begins? I need your help with this early Alpha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T05:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82ca30d05f041612707b7bf1b393e6d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ankaabii KIH"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
