The goal is to knock your opponent into the spikes. You can face off against an AI opponent or a friend. This game was made during a month long game jam themed \"sports which could never exist\".</p><p>Controllers are highly recommended for this game, but you can use the keyboard as well. It's configured to work with Xbox 360 controllers out of the box, but I believe you should be able to use other controllers by using the input configuration when starting the game. Here are the controls:</p><p><strong>Xbox Controller:</strong></p><ul><li>Move player (or swing flail when wielding flail) - D-pad</li><li>Flap wings - A</li><li>Wield flail - Left or right shoulder button</li></ul><p><strong>Player 1 Keyboard:</strong></p><ul><li>Move player (or swing flail when wielding flail) - Arrow keys</li><li>Flap wings - /</li><li>Wield flail - .</li></ul><p><strong>Player 2 Keyboard:</strong></p><ul><li>Move player (or swing flail when wielding flail) - r, d, f, g</li><li>Flap wings - s</li><li>Wield flail - a</li></ul><p><strong>Other things to note:</strong></p><ul><li>When wielding the flail, you get less of a boost from your bird flapping its wings. You also cannot control your player's direction when you're wielding the flail, since the directional controls are then used to swing the flail.</li><li>If you keep your flail out for long enough, it will charge up for more knockback.</li><li>If you pull out your flail but don't swing it immediately, you'll gain a shield for a brief instant.</li><li>Hold down while not wielding the flail to increase gravity's acceleration on you. This can help keep you from getting knocked into the top of the screen.</li><li>I've only had the chance to test the Windows build so far, but hopefully the Mac and Linux versions will work as well.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4bdf22e15d9daee450e38b1df3ff23e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cole Cecil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
