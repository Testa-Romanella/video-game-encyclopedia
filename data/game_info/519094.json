Plan your buildings smartly so that they all meet their requirements.</p>\n<p>But to build, you need construction materials. The delivery crates are scattered all around the land, you wil have to find them and gather them. unluckily, you lost a bet to your brother and now the floor is lava.</p>\r\nGame Jam information\r\n<p>This game is a submission for the MixAndGameJam 2020. I worked on it alone, except for the music that was made by a friend.<br/></p>\n<p>Almost all assets were in the 48 hours of the jam:</p>\n<ul><li>the 3D models and graphics</li><li>the music (thanks Malkins0n &lt;3)</li><li>the code</li></ul>\n<p>The only elements that were reused are:</p>\n<ul><li>the few SFX, retrieve on freesound.org (CC0 license)</li><li>the mayor's animations are from Mixamo</li><li>a personal finite state machine system for the character controller (https://github.com/Helluys/FsmCore - i suggest you do not use it, it is crap)</li></ul>\r\nLimitations<p>Due to the short time allowed, I could not go as far is I wished. Here are some things I know should be improved:</p><ul><li>Add a menu allowing to restart/quit/configure the game</li><li>Provide a true tutorial or way to understand the game (instead of this hastily added and ugly text panel)</li><li>Display current status of buildings, and give the player a way to know why a building is depraved</li><li>Allow to remap the controls (damn it InputSystem, Y U no work)</li></ul><p>There are probably plenty other things that need improvement. But hey, that was 48 hours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:18:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8ace529359371af615125d2d0153f943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Helluys"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
