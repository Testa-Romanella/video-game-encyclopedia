You are one of the selected few that will experience at length this beta, you have been selected based on your background and attitudes. I'm more than happy to hear your thoughts, \"enjoy it or break it\", email or direct message me with all encountered issues you might have. I hope you are able to play with excitement and enjoy as much as you playing it as I did creating it. This project started on June of 2018, and with much delay its finally on your desktop. Even though it isn't as polished as I would have wanted, it will (hopefully) not crash on your hands. I'll be sure to answer each and every inquiry. Any donation will be greatly appreciated with a wish of good fortune to you. All donations will go to a future project. The actual game maybe XD. <br/></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing.</p>\n<p>Godspeed. </p>\n<p>@dea6cat, @dea6catdev<br/></p>\n<p>notalexander24@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f7922adb80ae0f44203cc5131a57c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dea6catdev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
