It is set in high school, starring Nijisanji English's Luxiem and Petra, and you!</p>\n<p>The base concept is inspired by the Ouran High School Host Club anime.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is UNFINISHED; there's only one complete joke route and a longer common route. Only time will tell if I'll be able to execute the larger scope that's in my brain. This is more of a practice project and proof of concept that, although incomplete, I think is still fun to share.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>\u2022 Made with Ren'Py<br/>\u2022 Scuffed character art, writing, and coding by Dani - Twitter<br/>\u2022 All environment art originally by Uncle Mugen - Lemmasoft forum post<br/>\u2022 All music by Eric Matyas - www.soundimage.org<br/>\u2022 Sound effects by Mixkit and Soundjay<br/>\u2022 NIJISANJI EN, Luxiem, Petra - ANYCOLOR Inc.</p>\n<p>This fan game is a work of fiction.
