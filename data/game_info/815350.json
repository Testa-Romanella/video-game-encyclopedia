Can you find them all without stepping on any? Compete with yourself to get the best time. Think you're awesome? (I know you are!) Post your fastest finish\u00a0in the comments.</p>\n<p>This casual game plays <em>just like the old classic, Minesweeper.</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>LEFT CLICK</strong> = step!</li><li><strong>RIGHT CLICK</strong> = place (or remove) a flag where you think there's a bee.</li></ul>\n<p>If you step on a bee, you lose. Step elsewhere and\u00a0you'll see numbers showing how many bees are next to each hex. Use logic to figure out where there MUST be a bee, and put a flag there. Mark all fifteen to win!</p>\n<p>Graphics and code by HugBug.
