I decided to remake the Balloon Trip mode from the game\u00a0in Unity!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an arcade style mode, so go for the high score! Collect balloons to increase your score, and the higher combo you get the more points those balloons will be worth! You will also get 10 points for every half second you survive!</p><p>Try to avoid the purple stars!</p><p>Green Balloons: 300 points</p><p>Yellow Balloons: 500 points</p><p>Red Balloons: 700 points</p>\n<p>If you survive for over 2 minutes, the background will stop spawning and I'm not sure why. If you survive even longer it will come back. This doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it's worth noting.</p><p>I hope to also implement the Balloon Fight mode later on, but I didn't have enough time to figure out how the enemy AI would work.</p><p>This is also my first time working with the animator so I went with one static animation. With more time, I want to make it only animate when you pump and change to a different sprite when you hit a star.</p>\n<p>Be sure to click the screen to get audio! Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961af3d166418e602494536b17611cf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pmerklee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
