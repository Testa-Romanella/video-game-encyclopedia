This project is another, older submission for RMIT university's Games Design course, which I am apart of.</p>\n<p>The premise was creating a game based around the prompt: a game based on \"dodging\", which although could be interpreted in whatever way the students see fit, it involves any form of evasion as the main drive of the game.</p>\n<p>After reading the prompt, I instantly had ideas of high energy games, bullet hell like titles seemed like the logical fit. I chose however to subvert my initial impression of the premise, and try something completely different, which is how I arrived at the conclusion that stealth games also incorporate the idea of dodging and evasion, just in a less intense, more strategic sense.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the premise here is to create a stealth title with evasion of obstacles as the main mechanic, but I won't go further into how I accomplished it because that would spoil the <strong>magnificent, mind-bending, revolutionary story line.</strong> (not really)<br/></p>\n<p>Music acknowledgments:</p>\n<p>Composer: Josh Hickman (insta: @joshhickmanmusic) and Ionat\u00e1n Biniamin Maghidman\r\nProducer: Lucas de la Rosa (lucasmigueldelarosa@gmail.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f65805c06d2d6507763a238735a7b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ionatan B Maghidman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
