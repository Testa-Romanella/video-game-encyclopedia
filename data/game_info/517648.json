{"id": 517648, "slug": "elysian", "name": "Elysian", "name_original": "Elysian", "description": "<p>Elysian is an ambitious student project which features an expansive, semi open world environment littered with a handful of intractable characters. Elysian was built upon exploration of both world and dialogue, and allows the player to approach the overall goal any which way, as characters and questions change based on the decisions of the player. Aesthetics are another important factor of Elysian, as I put a lot of time into shader creation, my overall intent was to emulate the art style of anime within a 3d space. This anime-like style is placed alongside sci-fi styled assets and a natural, otherworldly setting, which I feel forms a unique visual identity for Elysian. The narrative that this project revolves around was heavily inspired by the works of Porter Robinson and his \u201cWorlds\u201d album (2014) while borrowing conventions and themes from Mamoru Oshii\u2019s \u2018Ghost in the Shell\u2019 (1995)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:50:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55e05bd8f6465d141045f8d7f8e202e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spacecatts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
