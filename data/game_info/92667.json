It is up to you to decide who you want to befriend, and hopefully regain your memories along the way\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>I made this game over the summer of 2015 and never quite fleshed it out as much as I wanted to, but if you want to look at a lot of my OCs in one place, here it is.</p>\n<p>Also, the endings are currently all platonic, but some have a romantic connotation depending on the character.</p>\n<p>One \"playthrough\" typically takes about 30 minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The game is completely free, and all I ask is that you do not repost/edit/trace/faceclaim/RP as any of my characters or use any of my art without my permission. All of the art was drawn by me with music from free resource sites credited in the download links.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The game is primarily in English with some Spanish and Chinese, but it is not necessary to know Spanish and Chinese to understand the game.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAYING/OPENING:\u00a0Otomeru Instructions\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0ROUTE GUIDE:\u00a0Otomeru Route Guide</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are 14 \u201cFriendship\u201d endings and 2 Bad Endings. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SAVE!\u00a0\r\nThere are 11 unlockable CG images and 14 unlockable ending cards.\r\nThere are 25 backgrounds (including day/night variations).\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is MEANT to be played as a self-insert/OC RP game! So for the best experience, try to play the game as if either you are a shark-person/Tibumeru or use your own Tibumeru OC.</p>\n<p>If you are stuck on a route (such as the \"Strange Girl\") do not try to force her ending until you have done all of the other routes first! There are hints as to how to unlock her ending.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to let me know!!
