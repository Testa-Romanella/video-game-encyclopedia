It is a final project for a college course I'm taking.</p>\n<p><em>Escape From Moon Road\u00a0</em>is a short escape room game with a setting in rural Georgia. The goal of the game is to escape a small shack that you wake up inside of in the middle of the night. The game is made with Unity and I may be redesigning the interaction functions to be something nicer.\u00a0 This is the current final product but there may be future changes.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking this project out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ce9f795863e7fd2c09ace6626e0e379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taszty"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
