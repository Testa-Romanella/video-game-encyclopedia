You play 6 mini levels randomly selected from the 120 levels available. If you die in one level, you will automatically go to the next level, there is no penalty.<br/><br/>Develop your reflexes, but also your memory for the position of the gold coins. Finish each level with the 3 gold coins to progress. Each level has an alternate version with new gold coins for a total of 240 levels. The frequency of appearance of a level decreases when you catch the 3 gold coins. In this way, you can focus on the remaining levels.<br/><br/>Once the game is over, the number of tries is sent with Game Center. You will be able to check if you did better than your friends.<br/><br/>If the game becomes too difficult, you can restart the game with all levels from the beginning. Go to the game settings (button with a gear) and use the button start again with the gold coins.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e2026900c2edd738ebac495703fffbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Christopher Legare Roussel"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Christopher Legare Roussel"], "esrb_rating": null}
