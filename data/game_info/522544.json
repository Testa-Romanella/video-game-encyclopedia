{"id": 522544, "slug": "solitude-12", "name": "Solitude 1.2", "name_original": "Solitude 1.2", "description": "<p><strong>Solitude</strong>\u00a0is a game in which you play as an astronaut maintaining an old space outpost and trying to get funding to restore it. To convince the investors, you have to reach a few milestones. The first one is to survive for 10 in-game days in the base(nothing much to do here, but it gets interesting later). Note that this alpha works only on a Windows\u00a0PC and is finished till the first milestone. Try the game and suggest changes, ask doubts, and report bugs at my discord server\u00a0https://discord.gg/WbPfDFA\u00a0. This is my first game, so your support will be helpful. May the Sun light your way.</p>\n<p>Alpha 1.1: Help page added.</p>\n<p>1.2: Fixed major bugs, added WASD controls, changed the textures of many objects, finished till Goal 1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/24906e2c414ed194be81eaa3eb8a7e1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curious Gravity"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
