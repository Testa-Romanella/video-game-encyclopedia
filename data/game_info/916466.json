It will not be an RPG like Yakuza 7, but a classic beatemap in the spirit of the past parts of the series. The Man Who Erased His Name will be smaller than the other games in the series and is primarily intended for those who have followed Kiryu&#39;s story since the very first Yakuza. However, the developers point out that the game has a standalone story, so it will be understood by newcomers as well. The storyline will unfold between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 7, and after that the story arc will continue in Like a Dragon 8. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released in 2023 on PC, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-01-28T21:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/5108534b4d2d0d0d66e4e17cda5a3749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 5", "PC"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
