Players must work together to tug, throw, and swing their partner in order to touch each node. A node is a floating intangible object that can be activated by passing through it. With each activated node, minimalistic particle effects start to return the beauty of a dying digital world which the players are trapped in. The game aims to emphasize cooperation while balancing mastery and difficulty to create a unique play experience. Test the strength of your friendship with friends, and see if you both have what it takes to make it through the game without throwing each other away.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCheck out our website at \r\n\tdontthrowmeaway.com</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/7914dfe75f5c40dba55dd845e9db5c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team DTMA"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
