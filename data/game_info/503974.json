But who could I trust other than myself, really? For now, let\u2019s try and stay afloat\u201d.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong>\u00a0yup, it\u2019s a time-space anomaly alright. With my airship\u2019s current speed, it should only take about a minute to pass it through, but I am needed in several places at the same time, and I only have my own two hands to rely on.</p>\n<p>But wait. Maybe I can use this loop to my advantage. As long as I plan my actions accordingly, I\u00a0<strong>can</strong>\u00a0be at several places at the same time, even going as far as preventing troubles before they actually happen!<br/>I mean, all I need to do is dodge my earlier copies when I\u2019m working. Easy, right?</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Keep</strong>\u00a0the airship systems functional and nicely green!</li><li><strong>React</strong>\u00a0to special events, or suffer massive damage!</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>\u00a0your own clones when things get too cramped!</li><li><strong>Reach</strong>\u00a0the end of the anomaly with your ship intact!</li><li><strong>Play in browser!</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0keyboard only. Use [W][A][S][D] or [ARROW KEYS] to move, press or hold [E], [X] or [ENTER] to interact. You can always leave the zone before the repairs are completed and return later, and clear up the debris to create shortcuts.\u00a0<br/><em>Check out additional hints by reading tutorial in-game.</em></p>\n<p>***<br/></p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0Yanrishatum.
