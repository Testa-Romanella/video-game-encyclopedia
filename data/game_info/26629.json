The familiar's attack \n      can be upgraded by collecting multiple souls of the same color in a row. \n      The four familiars power up and change independently of each other, \n      making for a game of strategy as you plan how to use each one \n      effectively.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/737c108960e4aaaffe7c3872e24b9dd0.jpg", "website": "http://www.genterprise.jp/ggusa/darkspirits.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Goodvision"], "esrb_rating": null}
