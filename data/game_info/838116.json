For the Wowie 4.0 gamejam.<br/>I took care of the programming, Unity stuff and Game design, along with the bad artwork.<br/>Voidsenight helped with game design and did all the good art work.<br/>Ilovechlorine wrote the banger soundtrack.<br/>This was the first time I collaborated with others. And honestly, it went pretty well. <br/>I was crunched up for time so there's a bunch of things missing. Mostly QoL features. <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552f760528b7b9caf349d917eec7cfd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emaker123"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
