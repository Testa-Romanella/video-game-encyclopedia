Platforms behave differently according to the selected difficulty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong>:\u00a0Move/Swing Left and Move/Swing Right<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>W</strong> and <strong>S</strong>: Pull Towards Platform and Push From Platform</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Q</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>E</strong>: Swap with Left Dino and Swap With right Dino</p>\n<p>- <strong>Space</strong>:\u00a0Jump (cannot jump while grappled, only when grounded)\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Use the mouse to aim for platforms and click\u00a0(hold) <strong>LMB</strong>\u00a0to attach to them</p>\n<p>- To detach from platform, release <strong>LMB</strong> (no matter where the cursor is)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Esc</strong>: Toggle\u00a0Pause Menu</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0You can grapple only to platforms above you and immediately next to you</p>\n<p>- The transparent platforms are out of your range, you can grapple only to fully visible ones</p>\n<p>- Hitting or Standing on a platform of a different color will cause your Dino to lose 1hp, and will also destroy the platform</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Swap Cool Down is of half a second</p>\n<p>- Collect Strawberries to get 1 UPs</p>\n<p>- Reach the top to finish the level</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>\n<p>- You can recheck the Controls and How To Play from the In Game Menu</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Swinging while Pulling will help you squeeze through very close\u00a0platforms\u00a0</p>\n<p>- After attaching to a platform, aim for a different platform (in your range) while keeping the LMB pressed. Clicking a different platform this way, allows you to navigate quicker from one level edge to the other</p>\n<p>- Dino's falling speed is based on the difficulty level, therefore platforms can get\u00a0harder to grapple to.\u00a0Falling diagonally helps clicking platforms more accurately</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p><ol><li> When platform is in moving state, and\u00a0 close to the ground terrain (start point of player), Dino can push through the terrain tiles while grappled,\u00a0 ending up\u00a0\u00a0in between the terrain colliders if LMB is released.</li><li>While Death Animation is active, Dino can still throw grapples to platforms until the Level Failure Menu is displayed, although keyboard-based user input is forbidden during that time.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Code</strong>:\u00a0seby_pacu - repo</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Sprites</strong>:<ul><li><em>Dino</em>:\u00a0https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters</li><li><em>Environment</em>:\u00a0https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1</li><li><em>UI</em><em> </em><em>Elements</em>:\u00a0https://pzuh.itch.io/free-game-gui</li><li><em>Cursor</em>:\u00a0\u00a0https://mikiz.itch.io/pixel-mouse-pointer</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sound Effects</strong>:\u00a0unity asset store</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d29c3d2059277e9b3f37228e965fbe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["seby_pacu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
