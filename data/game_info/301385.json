Over the course of the week, the major tasks were:</p>\n<ul><li>Turning the reverting into true time-traveling; at the end of the revert, a new player is spawned and the old player becomes the time clone, which does what you previously did.</li><li>Added 8 enemy types and a final boss.</li><li>Harvested and improved the demo's \"defend\" ability, and added \"fireball\" and \"counter\" abilities.</li><li>Writing the cliff+waterfall terrain generator. Much harder than expected, and took two entire days! Had to  abandon my first approach and instead use distance fields to place more landings.</li><li>Designing (well, tracing!) all of the symbols. Major thanks to Solstice333's Glift!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T04:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6d/c6df2e95cce6c39c75639380f3f0c8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Verdagon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
