But be sure to keep your party alive!</p>\n<p>With the help of your dance-commanding skills you gather a crowd of dancing people around you, and soon enough the whole dance floor will be yours!</p>Game rules<p>To gain movement speed press spacebar with the bit of the music.</p>\n<p>To gain control of another person, you or your party members need to physically bump into him (your sprites should collide). Auras around characters are only a visual indication of this character's faction.</p>\n<p>There are 4 different factions:</p><ul><li>Freeroamers (grey auras) - can be captured with any party strength. Gives +1 to your party strength when captured.</li><li>Solo dancers (blue auras) - can be captured if your party strength is 16<br/> or higher. Gives +5/+2 to your party strength when captured. If you \r\ninteract with them while your party strength is lower than 16, you would\r\n lose control of one of your party members.</li><li>Bouncers (red auras) - can be captured if your party strength is 46 or <br/>higher. Gives +10/+4 to your party strength when captured. If they see \r\nyou or your party members, the would start chasing you and would try to \r\narrest your party members, so you should try to avoid guys with red \r\nauras while your party strength is lower than 46.</li><li>Fake Dance Commanders (yellow auras) - can be captured if your party <br/>strength is 66 or higher. Gives varying amounts of party strength. If \r\nyou interact with them while your party strength is lower than 66, they \r\nwould steal your party members.</li></ul>\n<p>Guys with green auras are your party members</p>Controls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Spacebar - Dance!</li><li>ESC - Main menu</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Leonid Dudakov (@DetectiveLosos) - VFX, character art, programming<br/></p>\n<p>Alexander Kopiy (@kopiy_that) - environment art, level design</p>\n<p>Annie Owl (@owl_annie) - programming<br/></p>\n<p>Problemke (@morel_8ight) - music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ae/8ae4bde87fd096b7581ffc6d898dc3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dashing Ashes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
