A lot.<br/>\r\n - A peculiar story about facing the realities of life.<br/>\r\n - Every level a puzzle \u2013 you must decipher the pattern behind each level to progress.<br/>\r\n - An extraordinary original sound track by the amazingly talented Caleb Klomparens.<br/>\r\n - Everything is synced with the music \u2013 use this to help get into the flow of the levels.<br/>\r\n - A separate Free Play mode where you can try to play each chapter with the least amount of deaths and/or best time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFAQ:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nQ - Those colorful effects look cool, but they may be a bit much.<br/>\r\nA - For those that are prone to seizures, or pro players who want a cleaner experience, a majority of the effects can be disabled in the Options menu.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nQ - How many levels are there?<br/>\r\nA - 103, 90 levels in the story plus 13 bonus levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nQ - What is the estimated play time?<br/>\r\nA - The average is about 3 hours.

There is currently no multiplayer. Multiplayer for Free Play mode was in the works for some time, but was cut due to time restraints.
