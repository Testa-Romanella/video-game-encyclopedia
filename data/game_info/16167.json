Fast forward to the present day, a curious photographer overhears the fact of the tower actually existing and sets out to find it. His goal is to rich it&#39;s top.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Camera Obscura takes inspiration from Braid, Fez, and Ghosts and Goblins. The game uses the same storytelling principles that are used in these games, and death is not a major setback in the game. It was designed in a way to relax the players and make them feel safe without getting too repetitive or hard.</p>\n<p>Camera Obscura introduces an innovative mechanic to its gameplay. The players can take a shot of their surroundings and use these shots to traverse through the levels. This feature is mainly used to reach elevated places or cross a pit. There are 57 levels present in the game, with each one of them introducing a completely new puzzle to solve. These levels are divided into 8 zones which have a unique atmosphere and sound design for them.</p>\n<p>The game also comes bundled with a custom level editor. The players do not need any programming knowledge to create a level. It is possible to place platforms, doors, and enemies by dragging and dropping them to the required spot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/6896e1eb8fa6f1b43a20be65a6b0b986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.03, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 56, "owned": 1216, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 28}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 64, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 64, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anteater Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EQ Games", "BindleBot", "AntEater Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
