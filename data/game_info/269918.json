Whether alone against the AI or in \n      a duel against a real player on the same console, you'll send balls \n      careening across the table in four selectable, highly-detailed rooms as \n      you work your way up the local high score list.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Choose from ten attractive avatars as you duel against AI opponents of \n      varying difficulty levels.
