It is a <em>very</em> experimental platformer that features a colorful onebit-inspired artstyle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys = Move/Select\r\n</li><li>Space/W/Up = Jump\r\n</li><li>Esc/P = Pause\r\n</li><li>Back = Exit</li></ul>\n<p>In normal downward gravity, you move with A and D, or Left and Right arrow keys. But when gravity changes, so does your movement controls. In sideways gravity, you instead move with W and S, or Up and Down arrow. Space is always jump, but you can also jump with whatever direction key is opposite gravity.</p>\n<p>If you ever get stuck, you can respawn yourself from the pause menu. The game also saves your progress at almost every scene, so you can reload the tab if you need to.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n\r\n<ul><li>The player sometimes moonwalks</li><li>Shooting stars will sometimes appear over the ground<br/>\n</li><li>The player can get stuck on the corners of tiles if there's a diagonal boundary there between two different directions of gravity that pull the player inward<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to jazz_horse for testing and feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T13:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d3580f24f412b59e9de8f81648e18cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Immanent Death"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
