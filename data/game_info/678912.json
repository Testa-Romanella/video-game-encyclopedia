Aspiring to outgrow their neighbor, they fought for nutrients, sunlight and water. Some say, their rivalry escalated at times, when they tried to harm each other with malicious bugs!</p>\n<p><strong>Join the competitive experience today and help your tree achieve glory!</strong></p>\r\nAlgorithmic foundation\r\n<p>The trees are grown by applying rules according to Lindenmayer system. BloomBoom can be used as a sandbox to play around with crazy rules. Check it out on Wikipedia.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Round based two-player game played in hotseat. A player's turn is indicated by the colored border during gameplay. Apply a card effect by drag-and-drop on a specific snapping point. Positive effects can only be applied to your tree - negative to your opponent's tree. But be cautious: Acting maliciously may cause unwanted reactions. Each card effect is evaluated immediately by a massive array of raycasts measuring the mightiness of both trees. The icon next to the round counter indicates if you and your opponent both have enough snapping points for bugs to be playable.</p>\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nTrivia\r\n<ul>\n<li>All assets in this mini-game are home-made\r\n </li><li>Background music is inspired by Stardew Valley's secret forest (but not as awesome)\r\n </li><li>One tree was harmed during production\r\n </li><li>The original icon for nutrients displayed a pile of compost with a fly circling it\r\n </li><li>All bunnies have the same gender\r\n </li><li>Random names are based on fictional characters or celebrities (Can you catch them all?)\r\n </li><li>The arena is insanely small (menu tile texts have font size 0.1pt)</li><li>Trees in the arena background are all named MorganTreeman\r\n </li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was developed during the lecture \"Introduction to game development\" at Augsburg University.
