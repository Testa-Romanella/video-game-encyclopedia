Use your finger to aim and guide the bubbles to your desired spot, whether it is a quick win at the bottom or a strategically placed shot at the top. Shoot the bubbles up, merge them into higher numbers and eventually pop. The more bubbles you connect, the better! It sounds easy but surely is harder than you think! Guaranteed endless fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T15:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/ceecb45ca6186c2ce2e32c1a1ff289f2.jpg", "website": "http://casox.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Popcore", "casox"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Popcore", "casox"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
