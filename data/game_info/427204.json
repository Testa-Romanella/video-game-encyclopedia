Mainly I had trouble recruiting voice actors to play the parts (as in very few volunteered when I asked and even less replied after I\u2019d sent them the innuendo laden script). But, on a whim which I never expected to work, I emailed Christopher Walken\u2019s agent and, intrigued by the idea of a non-profit independent game based on Japanese poetry, he took five minutes from his schedule to record the lines on someone\u2019s laptop and emailed me a giant WAV file to cut up. If his voice sounds a little off, it\u2019s because he was pressed for time (he apologises) and it wasn\u2019t done in any kind of sound booth. I did my best to clean it up though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was inspired my experiences with the haiku mini-game in Boku no Natsuyasumi 3. This was in Japanese though, and I wanted something analogous in English for western players to appreciate.</p>\n<p>The poems are generally free-form, but I tried to adhere to most of the rules for writing English haiku. Since only fellow game players are likely to take an interest, all the poems were based on well-known videogames. I suppose the great failing of this endeavour is that you need a background in games to understand them. Christopher mentioned he only got a couple of the references. <br/></p>\n<p>The game features:<br/></p>\n<p>* A JRPG style of design<br/>* A large overworld to explore<br/>* Villages to visit<br/>* NPCs to speak with<br/>* Stores and inns to stop by<br/>* Unique \u201cinstant-time\u201d battle system<br/>* Five different monsters to fight<br/>* Streamlined inventory system<br/>* 125 different poems to compose<br/>* 5 true haiku to decipher<br/>* A special \"hidden secret\" from the gods of haiku<br/>* An incredible ending which will leave you floored<br/>* The voice work of Christopher Walken</p>\n<p>TIP: When playing, please do NOT hold down the arrow keys, rather tap them, since otherwise it may skip certain poetry sections.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c6e1af280919779e47411d9cac6d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
