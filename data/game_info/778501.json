It's made for up to five players. It's best played outdoors in large flat areas like a grassy field.</p>\n<p>First, players are asked to select what they think should be the #1 priority out of the\u00a017 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Then that priority becomes a virtual goal post in the field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A Earth ball falls from the sky. The game's objective is to push the Earth in the direction you think we should be going. The other players have competing goals so they may become blockers. The game is designed to create asymmetric goals to create conflict, and it's up to the players to negotiate what should be the priority.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>\"Should we concentrate on X goal?\"\u00a0\r\n</li><li>\"Or should we spend equal amounts of time on each?\"</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game may sound familiar. The original \"Earthball\" game for the New Games Movement in the late 60s/early 70s inspired this game. The New Games Movement partially came out of frustration of the violence and conflict of the Vietnam War. They were looking for playful activities that were non-violent and kinder. Earthball was designed so that players could continuously play. They were tasked to roll it from one edge of the field to another. Players could switch teams, and there was no \"win\" state.</p>\n\n<p>an historical perspective of the New Games Foundation (deepfun.com)\r\n</p>\n<p>We are in a similar period of civil unrest both nationally and internationally. It's time again to get together, play through our differences, and see how much we have in common.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each of us is a small sphere of influence, but those can add to a larger collective influence.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Developed by Todd Little</p>\n\n<p>Fonts<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Rubik Moonrocks</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Fredoka One</p>\n<p>2D Assets</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Joystick Pack by Fenerax Studios</p>\n<p>3D Assets</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Modified \u201cSoccer Goal\u201d by davimfs7</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022\u201cPlanet Earth Free\u201d by headwards</p>\n<p>Code/Tools</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Lightship ARDK by Niantic</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Normcore Multiplayer by Normal</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Shapes by Freya Holm\u00e9r</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u2022 Movement Tutorials by Jasper Flick</p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>\u2022 SFXs made in JSFXR</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u2022 Music composed in Figure</p>\n<p>Thanks to the support from my family, friends, my Fair Worlds crew, and all the organizers of Indiecade Climate Jam 2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:47:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d6a473b9b44555a197ca89eb6598c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Todd Little"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
