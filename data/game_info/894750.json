YOU WILL INFILTRATE AN UNDERGROUND FACILITY AND DESCEND 3 FLOORS UNTIL YOU REACH THE BOTTOM LEVEL.</p>\n<p>AT THAT POINT, A CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVE WILL DETONATE AND SHUT OFF ALL POWER, ALLOWING YOU TO ENTER THE FINAL ACCESS POINT. ALSO, THERE ARE NO BATHROOMS SO YOU MUST GO BEFOREHAND.</p>\n\n<p>YOU MUST BRING YOUR\u00a0SUITCASE AND YOUR GUN.\u00a0THE SUITCASE IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT, DO NOT FORGET IT.\u00a0IT IS THE MOST VITAL PART OF YOUR MISSION.</p>\n<p>YOUR GUN IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT,\u00a0BUT YOU ALREADY BRING IT WITH YOU EVERYWHERE SO I DO NOT NEED TO REMIND YOU. I WAS ONCE TOLD YOU BROUGHT IT TO YOUR NIECE'S\u00a0PIANO RECITAL.<br/></p>\n\n<p>GOOD LUCK, AGENT R#BB!T. I WILL CALL IN AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE THE MISSION\u00a0TO GIVE YOU THE FINAL GO-AHEAD.</p>\n<p><em>[END TRANSMISSION]</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>OUTAGE is a top-down shooter where you must stealthily take down any target and avoid being seen by others.</p>\n<p>Outage was originally made for a game jam, but I was not satisfied with the final result so I left it alone for a month or two. I finally decided to go back and revamp the whole game, including adding cutscenes and making gameplay more intuitive.</p>\n<p><strong>It is recommended that you play this game in the dark.</strong></p>\n\n<p>All credit goes to my roommate. He soundtracked most of the game during the initial 3-day span of the game jam. Please check out the soundtrack found here on the Bandcamp page. He specifically requested to be credited as simply \"my roommate\", so let me know what you think of the soundtrack so I can tell him!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TWITTER PAEG (stay updated on future projects)<br/>YOUTUBE (ill upload some walkthroughs here)<br/>DISCORD (eipc discord just to chat and stufs)</p>\n<p>BANDCAMP (linking this again cuz its cool...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T09:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3d/f3dbc47e62f96c25997e3f11c23bb1d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["deklaswas"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
