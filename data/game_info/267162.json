That task ended up being much bigger then expected, and to make it work I had to refactor most of my engine!</p>\n<p>The upside to this left me with a game engine that can play .ogv files and runs much more stable! The downside is no time was left to add in a game. Still, was able to show off some of my work all the same, even if its just a lone meme. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>WARNING! LOUD!
