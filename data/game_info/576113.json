It's a <strong>standing-up</strong>, <strong>\"room-scale-ish\"</strong> (you don't need a lot of space) experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Using the triggers and grip buttons as <strong>pistons</strong>, you decide which note to play (<em>spoiler: not every notes of the scale are available</em>).</p>\n<p>The goal was to explore how to involve the player's body while making very simple melodies.<br/></p>\n<p>The original idea behind this is that by moving your hands, <strong>you grab wind</strong>, and therefore the instrument can produce sound. In the end, with <em>the lack of signs and feedbacks</em> (because of time), this initial intention is kind of lost. And of course, the sound is one of a basic synthesizer. So...there is that.</p><p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You will have <strong>4 levels</strong> to defeat. How so? By playing the required melody correctly. There is a purple box on your left playing the wanted melody when you touch it.<br/></p><p>The \"melody detector\" is very sensitive. If you play a small in-between note, it will be taken into account, so the game is a bit difficult at first. The technique is to stop moving very shortly just before changing your inputs.</p><p>The game shows you which notes you played, you can use that to understand how you did.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Expected play time:</strong> 10 minutes. <br/></p>\n<p>Of course it depends on your ability to play the instrument correctly, and the ability of this mini game to not bore you. :)<br/></p>\n<p>It's the second of, I hope, multiple fragments exploring simple and short concepts in virtual reality. \r\n    </p>\n<p>My goal is to be able to release game-jam-like (maximum 2-3 days of  development) short experiments in the following weeks. This one  took around 2 days and a half. With a lots of time lost in non working interaction ideas and debugging the mechanics. The result is not very convincing, but still, I committed to release these experiments, so, here it is!<br/></p>\n<p><em>I hope you will enjoy it!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4bab140e62ddbf233eabce66b0e242a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llnaej"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
