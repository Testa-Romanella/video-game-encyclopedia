Dice Assault is a first person arena shooter, where you acquire currency through killing waves of enemies, which you can then spend at the terminal to roll your chances on either new levels, obstacles, weapons, abilities, and ammo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam was \"Roll of the Dice\", and we wanted to build a game that really represented rolling a random chance. During the 48 hours, we developed nearly all the code from scratch, and built the environments and levels using Quixel Megascans. Models, weapons, and VFX are from the Unreal Engine Store, all licensed appropriately.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>RULES/MECHANICS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-You spawn with a pistol and a random arena, with waves of enemies spawning immediately. Kill the enemies to get money, and once you have enough, quickly go to the terminal to roll your chances at something new:</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Tier 1: New Level (chance of spawning key)\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Tier 2: New Obstacles, Weapon, or Level (also chance of spawning a key)\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Tier 3: New Weapon, Abilities, or Ammo</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Tier 4: New Abilities or Ammo\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-If you run out of health, health pickups in glowing red spawn around the map to pickup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-If you run out of ammo/money, money pickups will spawn around the map as well, keep an eye out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Through random obstacle generation or level, there's a chance of a key spawning, a glowing blue pickup. Collect 3 keys to finish the game!</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Your time is tracked throughout the entire experience and saved even when you close the game, so try to beat your own score! You can reset your best time as well.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a very quick prototype to display the concepts we set out to build, and we were able to include a lot of them. We wish to continue development to make this into a full fledge game, and we are only a 2 man team, so any donations are appreciated.
