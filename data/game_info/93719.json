{"id": 93719, "slug": "virtual-slotcars-demo", "name": "Virtual SlotCars Demo", "name_original": "Virtual SlotCars Demo", "description": "\n<p>Virtual SlotCars is a game in which you\r\nbuild and race slot cars. You will be tweaking your car components, testing them on track, setting your throttle controls, and finally racing your chosen car to earn coin and gain experience which will be used to unlock and buy higher level components for your car, enabling it to handle better and go even faster.</p>\n<p>This demo provides a pre-made, two lane track to race on. You can also create custom track designs in the editor, of any size, with up to 8 lanes, then assemble them during that game session to race on.</p>\n<p>The full version offers 28 pre-made track designs (with up to 8 lanes), and allows you to save your custom track designs, to edit them or race on them later in single player or multiplayer.<br/></p>\n\r\nBefore you do anything\r\n\r\n<p>Please read the Throttle set up section in\r\nthe manual. VSC offers a unique configurable 3 key and/or Gamepad solution to control your car throttle. Understanding how it works, practising in a practise session, per lane, per track, and configuring it using the interface causes your settings to be recorded for each track and each lane. These settings will then be used during a race, and are paramount for obtaining the best slot car experience. Soon VSC will further offer complete custom key binding which will enhance this feature even more.<br/></p>\n\r\nSingle Player\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of this demo version you will be provided with a basic car and set of track parts which will allow you to practise and compete in entry level races. As you get familiar with car handling and maintenance you will soon be winning races and gaining experience and coin. Before you know it you will be able to upgrade your car parts and challenge even faster AI opponents. <br/></p>\n<p>The full version offers extensive level and car parts upgrades, longer tracks with more lanes, providing all that you need to work towards the ultimate level of Ace, racing at\r\npotential speeds well in excess of 70 km/h. Alternatively, you can spend your time and coin creating new elaborate custom tracks in the track editor. The options are endless. <br/></p>\n\r\nMultiplayer\r\n\r\n<p>This demo is limited to single player.</p>\n<p>In the full version you can race against friends in Multiplayer with your own personalised car. Host custom track circuits that you made, with your own set of racing rules and car configuration limits. Create your own <strong>car body\r\nmods</strong> and import them into the game for your friends to see and race against. While VSC offers its own track-set parts, it also offers full <strong>modding support</strong> allowing you to create your very own blue-print to track-set solution, to create any specific track you can dream of. If you find you do not have the track or car body you want to race with, and you are not a modder, the option to obtain your perfect car or track will be made available through the community of modders. <br/></p>\n\r\nDemo game details\r\n<p>(Struck out items available in the full version)<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Player levels:</strong> Beginner, Regular, Advanced, Pro, Ace.

They each work from home in the Czech Republic, and have invested their resources and time into the completion of VSC.</p>\n<p><strong>Enrico Turri - </strong>Developer / Programmer. The original VSC concept\r\nstarted with Enrico, and has grown into what it is today. A Slot Car\r\nfan himself from childhood, Enrico's attention to car handling,\r\nphysics, AI, aggregated racing data, proprietary Rigel engine and\r\nmodding tools, sets VSC apart from the competition. He also enjoys\r\nplaying classical piano, and the taste of a hard earned Czech beer. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Endicott</strong> - Developer /\r\nDesigner. Having discussed slot cars and the VSC concept numerous\r\ntimes with Enrico before the project started, Gavin focuses on game\r\nmechanics, flow, UI, visuals, sound, IT, marketing and whatever else\r\nis required. He is also a fan of RTS games such Rome, RPGs like NWN2,\r\nand has been known to play some board games.</p>\n\r\n(Enrico left, Gavin right)\r\n\r\nWhat we'd like to add next\r\n\r\n<p>We like the idea of Environment Assets, do you?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1557b07f65e6bdf2de1d6186a007f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PraGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
