Also would've loved to make the \"conversation system\" more fleshed out and cooperative but didn't have enough time. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any feedback whether that be bugs or whatever then I would love to hear it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>James</p>\n<p>Twitter: @JamesBriggs123</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T03:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc431472f5d2277cd779ed819f281056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamesBriggs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
