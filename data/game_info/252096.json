{"id": 252096, "slug": "easy-mahjong-solitaire", "name": "Easy! Mahjong Solitaire", "name_original": "Easy! Mahjong Solitaire", "description": "\"Easy! Mahjong Solitaire\" is simple puzzle game that uses the mah-jong tile. It is possible to play easily anytime and anywhere by an easy rule. <br/><br/>The game begins at once when starting. It is possible to interrupt and to restart at any time because it starts from last time and the same when ending and starting as follows. Neither the menu panel nor the option screen have been installed so that everyone may enjoy playing a game at once. <br/><br/>The rule is very easy. (!! NOT \"Shanghai Mahjong\" rule !!)<br/>If two mah-jong tiles of the same design that queues up in the screen are taken by one pair, and all tiles are taken, it becomes clear. <br/>The selection of the tile does the tile with the finger by touching directly. The tile that can be taken has the condition like the under. <br/><br/>- It is not possible to take it when there is a tile of another design between two tiles. <br/>- The tile that length and breadth adjoins can be taken. <br/>- The tile at the position that can be connected by the straight line in length and breadth can be taken. <br/>- The tile at the position where the straight line bends up to two times can be taken, too. <br/><br/>It becomes \"GameOver\" when the tile that can be taken is lost. <br/>Of not becoming \"GameOver\", there is a tile that can surely be taken.<br/>(Please refer to the web page for a detailed rule)<br/><br/>If you can not find a pair of tile that can be taken, do shake the iPhone/iPod touch about two times. You will begin a new game. <br/><br/>A puzzle that a lot of tiles and is wide comes out, too, when some puzzles are cleared. When clearing in addition... puzzle that changes a little.There is not a puzzle selection either. It enjoys the puzzle that comes out one after another endlessly by your tempo. <br/><br/><br/>Added Time-Attack mode at last update.
