This was my original vision but due to the limitations of Unity and open terrains, and my unwillingness to compromise\u00a0on graphics the project is being ported over to Unreal in order to achieve\u00a0its original vision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Unreal version will also be made available\u00a0for free and I've offered up this version as a way to open up dialog between dev &amp; gamer to learn more about what you like to see in this genre.</p>\n<p>Please comment, and if you like follow my YouTube channel as soon I will start a devlog charting the progress of the next version.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD - Controls</strong></li><li><strong>R-MOUSE - Aim</strong></li><li><strong>AIM + L-Mouse - Shoot</strong></li><li><strong>R - Reload</strong></li><li><strong>E - Pickup</strong></li><li><strong>Q - Roll</strong></li><li><strong>L-Shift - Sprint</strong></li><li><strong>Space - Jump</strong></li><li><strong>Z - Aim Down Sights</strong></li><li><strong>I - Inventory (select weapon you don't\u00a0want first, then select new)</strong></li><li><strong>Arrow Right - Change Weapon</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T14:48:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e14d82c5dad061ccecc5cf3484050b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Manifesto Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
