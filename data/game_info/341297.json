The villagers he's grown up to know, look on him with disgust and everyone treats him differently. He wakes on the morning of the village festival to chaos and slaughter. Dark figures on the shore fighting and burning the village. Are they at war? Who are these creatures? They don't look bearkin. What do they want with them? Unjin rows across the lake as fast as he can but when he lands on the shore of the village, all is quiet again. The tribe is gone. The dead lay everywhere. Why would they do this? He finds Chief Brownstripe dying in his tent and with his last words, he tells Unjin of his father\u00a0Chief Redfeather and the Great War\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>What Is The Game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tribals is a 2d sidescroller hack-n-slash tag-team platformer with RPG elements. A game built for the classic retro lovers. Produced in a modern art style with its rich graphical landscapes and built on raycasting physics for a fluid experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Play as all four main characters and swap back and forth during combat for amazing combos and creative assaults. Each comes with their own unique play style and talent tree, for mix and match replayability. The Archer whos bow snipes the furthest targets and lays traps for his enemies. The Rouge whos grapple grabs trolls and cliffs alike. The Knight who wields his sword and armour as a charging bruiser. Lastly the cold and calculating Hoplite, who tanks the front lines and attacks when he sees a weakness. How will you coordinate their teamwork?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Who We Are:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bridgecrafters Studios is a boot-strapping micro-startup with no funding and less experience. We just believe in great games and dislike the modern micro-transaction money grab that the industry is pushing these days. Our intended brand is much simpler, \"traditional games made well\". We are a small group of creative types working with freelancers and volunteer game enthusiasts to produce content we enjoy and believe that you will too. The game dev community is large and diverse and you can't start off making AAA titles so people need active projects to gain experience. We at Bridgecrafters believe in this community of artists, programmers, writers, and music producers and intend on being a stepping stone for these entry-level types while maintaining quality gameplay. This is why Bridgecrafters is our chosen name. We are building bridges between the fans and the wide range of talent that is out there. We are also trolls and like to sit under said bridges from time to time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tribals is a simple game, but it's a start. Consider supporting us.
