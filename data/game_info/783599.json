Dogoir", "description": "<p>You are one half of a newly formed crime fighting duo - either a detective or his faithful hound. After your first day of work together you decide to go to the park to wind down before heading home. But on your way home you hear a gunshot from nearby and quickly make your way to the source of the sound: a rundown bar where a man has been shot to death. Four people were in the bar when it happened but no one's owing up to the murder. It's up to the two of you to interrogate suspects, discover clues and piece the events together to uncover the murderer. But you will only be able to do so as a team. Can you and your partner figure out which of these suspects is a murderer?</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Dickson Hee -\u00a0https://www.dheeportfolio.com/</p>\n<p>Tom\u00a0Lorenti -\u00a0https://sites.google.com/student.sae.edu.au/tomlorenti/projects-experience</p>\n<p>Aubrey Vigus -\u00a0https://ryanvigus.com/</p>\n<p>Liz Glass -\u00a0https://www.lizrglass.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T14:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e29/e29f39697952259e6c91b3c40e9c83c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Katanoueki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
