Players operate their monster-breeding business, tame beasts and mythical creatures, train warriors and sorcerers, then forge them into a team, and send them to the greatest arenas of the Empire to engage in deadly combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, choose a city where your base is going to be. Breed creatures, and modify their characteristics through magic and alchemy to make them stronger. You can hire warriors and sorcerers to fight in the arena, but slaves may also be trained for combat. How much risk are you willing to take? Which tournament are you going to enter? Only you decide. You get money if you take part in a tournament, but only the winners receive the glory and extra rewards. But don\u2019t worry, not every combat is mortal \u2013 only those that pay well\u2026<br/><br/>Besides battles, the other important feature of the game is managing your enterprise. Develop your base, research magic, and capture rare, mythical creatures. Hire an alchemist to prepare useful magic potions, and a blacksmith to produce unique weapons and armors.
