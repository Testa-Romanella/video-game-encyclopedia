The story of the game is that a character from Dungeons and Dragons went into a sorcerer's dimension, and messed everything up, so he teleported back to an Inn, which was attacked by many wizards (Boxes right now), and you, the player were struck by lighting and turned into a toilet. This is a rage game btw, play at your own risk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ESC to exit the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T09:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad04d71367fbaaf071ccac252d8d5d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MassiveBreaker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
