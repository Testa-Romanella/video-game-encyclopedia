It use to be a peaceful place, but now evil lurks deep in the fields. Terrified for their lives, the family has taken refuge in the barn. They\u2019ve been stuck for days and are hungry. It\u2019s up to you harvest the crops to feed them, or die trying.</strong></p>\n<p>Goal: Harvest your crops <strong>(SPACEBAR)</strong>\u00a0as fast as you can while avoiding scarecrows that have come to take revenge upon your family. They'll relentlessly hunt you while you collect food needed to survive. When you think you've collected all that you can,\u00a0take\u00a0it back to your barn to save it and head back out for more.
