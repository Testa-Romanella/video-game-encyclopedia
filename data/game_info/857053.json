{"id": 857053, "slug": "project-t", "name": "Project T", "name_original": "Project T", "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Project T!</strong> An atmospheric 2D platformer game set in a fantasy world.</p>\n<p>You control Mia \u2013 an athlete and magician using her powers to unveil the mystery inside a giant malfunctioning titan.</p>\n<p>This game is an homage to oldscool sidescrollers and also to some of the newer and popular platformers.</p>\n<p>With Mia you can traverse the insides of the titan by jumping, clinging to walls via branches, and combining all of that with a powerful dash ability.</p>\n<p>Note that dash must be recharged each time after use by standing on a floor surface. You can't use dash twice or more times in the air.</p>\n<p>You can't hold on to walls forever as well. Don't hesitate!</p>\n<p>Our goal was to make your playthrough and traversal as fluid as possible and we hope that you'll like it. Or you can leave your suggestions on what should be improved. Feedback is always appreciated!</p>\n<p>This is an early technical demo for both casual and speed walkthroughs (game saves your progress like time and attempts after level completion).</p>\n<p>!!! Please note that in this version checkpoints don't save your progress if you decide to quit to main menu before the level's end.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move \u2013 WASD or Arrow Keys</li><li>Jump \u2013 Space</li><li>Dash \u2013 WASD + Left Shift (tap, don't hold). Can be performed in air.</li><li>Slide (while on a wall) \u2013 S</li></ul>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Some known bugs in this version:</p>\n<ol><li>There are some instances with sprites flipping incorrectly in certain situations. Does not affect gameplay.</li><li>There is a bug that allows players to use dash straight after a respawn two times in a row without recharging.</li><li>There could be incorrect sprite behaviour on moving platforms. Does not affect gameplay.</li><li>Holding Left Shift might lock Move controls in the air. Right now we advise you to tap Left Shift when you want to dash.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23e4d74b1b800850e798a3fc6fb09916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InfiniteBits"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
