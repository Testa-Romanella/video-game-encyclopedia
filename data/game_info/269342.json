After your car breaks down upon arrival, you immediately find that radiation from other test sites have plagued the town with mutants of the past inhabitants.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore the town and collect weapons, ammunition and other items while attempting to get off the island before the next nuclear strike hits.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPay attention to your surroundings, always! Keep in mind this game is a one-shot straight play-through: there is no saving.
