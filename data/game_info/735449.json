So, I fleshed it out and turned it into this little idle \"screensaver\" for you!\u00a0I will probably add music and some other backgrounds, etc. Time will tell!<br/><br/>If you like it and are able, please consider a small donation to help support my project in\u00a0development\u00a0(and my family!)<br/><br/>(Title screen says Pixidle Campfire, but I decided that was too confusing. I will update the logo soon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T05:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4eb70a4effaa44f727b11f092c8fc6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dirtbug.games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
