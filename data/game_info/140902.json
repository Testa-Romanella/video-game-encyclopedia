Knight's Tour is a chess variant where the player moves around a Knight (a single playable character) on a board of tiles. </p><p>The objective is to cover all the tiles without revisiting any of them. The Knight moves in a L-shape pattern (2 tiles forward and 1 tile to the side). </p><p>The interaction is very simple. The player has to simply select the board size in the UI. The board sizes offer varying degree of difficulty to the player. Upon hitting play, the player is presented with a hovercraft that has to move in an L-shape pattern by simply clicking on a valid tile.</p><p>If the player runs out of valid moves before completing the circuit, the game is lost. If the player is able to cover all the tiles, the game is won. That simple!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/702b2f83fc258c27bb3a5cafdbfce13f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sanathshekar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
