But remember though: there are no brakes in space, so getting the ship to\u00a0stop without wandering off\u00a0is no picnic!</p>\n<p>-Ruthlessly unyielding walls, bombs of instant death, anti-gravitic white holes,\u00a0and pesky doors that won't stay open\u00a0will put your piloting skills to the test.<br/></p><p>-Easy to learn but hard to master. Awkward at first but glorious once you get the hang of it.</p>\n<p>-Set the resolution up to 4k or\u00a0as low as 128 x 72 because it's funny.</p>\n<p>-Expected play time: 45 minutes to an hour\u00a0if you're not particularly awful at it. Speedruns under 15 minutes are possible if you can git gud enough.</p><p>-Inspired by the flash games of yore and spaceflight games of yore's yore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T11:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a4425334ca413875c1a40d0c01e38d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ostrich Machine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
