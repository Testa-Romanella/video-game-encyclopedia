When you purchase a building, you can choose whether to make it into a Speakeasy or a Distillery.\u00a0</li><li>Distilleries produce alcohol over time. When they have alcohol available, they will automatically deliver it to the nearest Speakeasy, by sending a delivery car.\u00a0</li><li>Speakeasies can sell alcohol, but only if they have it available. When a civilian walks near a speakeasy, they have a random chance to enter the building and purchase a drink. \u00a0Speakeasies don't produce alcohol on their own so you'll need to create at least one distillery. </li><li>But look out, the cops are coming! If a police car drives by a building that has any alcohol stored in it, they will confiscate it all, setting your production back! To avoid this, you can instruct a purchased building to hide. Doing to will halt their production (or sales) of alcohol, but at least your supply will be safe. Once the police have passed, you can instruct the building to resume operations.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong>:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Alexander Crane\r\n  </li><li>John Ying\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>\r\nTitle Screen Art:\r\n  </strong></p>\n<ul><li>Nicholas Haines\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>3D Assets:\r\n  </strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/modular-industr...\r\n  </li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/brick-house-742...\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sounds:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music - Pierce Putz (LudoLoon Studio) https://ludoloonstudio.itch.io/tabletop-jazz-cafe\r\n  </li><li>https://soundbible.com/1997-Cha-Ching-Register.html\r\n  </li><li>https://soundbible.com/1666-M1-Garand-Gunfire.html\r\n  </li><li>https://soundbible.com/1244-Pouring-Hot-Tea.html\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/0185717fa62e781f80c1cfa4a2e5473f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axelancer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
