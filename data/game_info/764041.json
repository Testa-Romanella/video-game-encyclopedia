Unlike\u00a0Project_USoMK, here I focused on character mechanics and developed a more detailed\u00a0character. I also test shaders, camera transitions, lighting and AI here. You can\u00a0access the list I shared on\u00a0YouTube\u00a0about the progress of the project.\r\n</p>\r\nBut Why ?\r\n<p>Actually, my main goal is to develop an isometric action-adventure game\u00a0(The developer is excited).\u00a0According to this goal, I started coding game mechanics and wanted to test them. This is how Npcs test Room came out. <br/></p>\n\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Your feedback is very valuable to me. It would be great if you leave feedback in the comments :)</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><strong>How to Play :</strong>\n</p>\n\r\nCharacter Mechanics &amp; Objects:\r\n<p><strong>Destructible Objects &amp; Attacking:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Pads:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Carryable Objects:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Pushable Objects:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Climbing:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Animated Objects:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Using Fire Soul to trigger Boiler</em>\n</p>\r\n\r\nWhat's Next ?\r\n<p>I'm still learning a lot of things about to game development and I'm constantly testing what I've learned. In the future, I will continue to add new mechanics that I have developed to the game.\u00a0Here is a short list of what I want to add next :\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; AI and different types of enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; More animated objects/events.\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; Weapon based attack animations.\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; New soul runes.\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; Spell attack system.\r\n</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>-&gt; If you keep walking while placing carryable objects on the ground,\u00a0 they will start to bounce. (Rigidbody issues)\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; The slash effects\u00a0only exists on the\u00a0first attack. (I'm working on the sync)\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; Camera transition is not smooth enough.\r\n</p>\n<p>-&gt; Some character animation transitions is not smooth enough.\r\n</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Casual RPG Character - Avelyn\r\n</p>\n<p>Animations from Mixamo\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T03:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef8cf9673481fb7e48d909e2f3d527e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["berkaynpc"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
