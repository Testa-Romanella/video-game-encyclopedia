The other belonged to the Sun. They did not like it when you abandoned your domain for each other. So they bestowed a curse on you both to keep you apart for good. The Sun made it so that one would be human only in the day, and an owl in the night. The Moon made it so that the other would be a human only in the night, and a wolf in the day. There are only a few minutes at dusk and a few at dawn at which time both are human at the same time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Game-play requires the Face Cards from a card deck (K,Q,J), a timer, and optionally, control of whatever light you have handy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T11:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f3/8f3d77bbbe7cbd22149c10b6b8c6b40b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superdillin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
