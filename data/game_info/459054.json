He had his usual nights spent with his wife and children after coming from work. His work was dull, he was going around in circles upon the fruits all day. Sun was hot, days were boring, he was blaming the god if need to be honest. Why to give Fruit Flies such a boring job, to annoy people all day, just to show them that heaven was and is much more beautiful place to live in then this world. Stanley returned home thinking all about this on the way, but what he didn\u2019t know was the fact that tomorrow was going to be a lot more different. Stanley now is in a place where he needs you for going back home to Garden of Eden, heaven. Can you help out to this poor fella?</p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0 a final project designed for\u00a0Fundamentals of Game Design II and Introduction to Game Engines.
