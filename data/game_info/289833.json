The goal of the game is to collect as many items as possible around the map without getting attacked by the monsters. You can hide from the monsters inside your house by pressing the space bar. Move around with WASD to collect as many items as you can until you decide to settle down with what you have. Home is what you make it, settle your home when you are happy with how much you have collected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fac/facc26fd759057104724e3f258d06122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Wang", "nawaf", "Gil Robern", "jakebutineau", "ubercharge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
