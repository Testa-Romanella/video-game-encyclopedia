Ran out of time so I couldn't add music or a title screen, but I love the result so far, I plan on updating it in the near future. The only things made outside the jam are the enemy dragon and the default Unity assets.</p>\n<p>cards 'n Bullets is a mix of card game and bullet hell where battle takes 10 seconds.\u00a0Of course I need to explain the card game rules since there's no tutorial.</p>\n<p>Every turn you draw a card, then have to send one to the mana tube, and then draw yet another card. You can then choose to either use a card send another to the mana tube. Because I tripped while setting up the game, the mana tube is a bit cracked. Paying card cost may cause unintended effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed80dab88a0767f3e59a0910e5c1bdeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Some Tiny Dragon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
