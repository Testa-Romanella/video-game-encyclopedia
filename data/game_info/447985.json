Nontheless, some erudites tried to read old books with dark power. This game could seem another GrimDark game about sorcery, but far than that, this game is about an adventurer!<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Your mission: gather as much potions as you can while the enchanted creature cheases you through the darkness.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>The loot is endless but needed. Get the all and run, light up as many lights as you can and find the best path to succeed in your mission!</p>\n\n<p>This is a QuickProtogame ready to work on Browser for easier playing experience. Despite of that, this game is meant to be played in PC as well or either in Console if wanted.\u00a0All feedback is well received!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This can be the beginning of a real game, and feedback is the best way to get the answer.
