In it, you manage a series of turrets to protect your base against attacking organisms. You have two types of turrets at your disposal; fire and ice. Fire turrets will damage ice enemies and vice versa. You must take advantage of each turret's strengths, or you are sure to fail. <br/></p><p><em>AFROFARG</em> is not an easy game, but once you get the hang of buying and salvaging turrets to suit your current needs, the game becomes much simpler to play and beat. <br/><br/>The game features three unique maps to play on, each with their own individual blind spots and choke points. You may fail on a map multiple times before you master it. Each map has 40 waves of enemies, each new wave progressively harder than the last. <br/><br/>Be sure to read the help post, it offers a lot of information on how the game works and what you need to be successful. <br/><br/>Thanks for playing!
