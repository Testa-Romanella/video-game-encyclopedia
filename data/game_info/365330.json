We trap them in test chambers of <strong>only one</strong> screen\u00a0and in a time loop of <strong>only one</strong> minute, to select\u00a0the most cunning and hellbent on escaping. <strong>Only one</strong> blob will make it to the next generation!</p>\n<p>Disclaimers:<br/>- please play the HTML version in fullscreen!<br/>- due to a fuck up on our side, the windows build was a wrong version of the game (different from the HTML build). We re-uploaded the correct version after the jam deadline, though the fixes were made\u00a0before 8pm BST. The two versions are now identical.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f1f095eda69bc878bbae4ab6fcf86ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kegnarok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
