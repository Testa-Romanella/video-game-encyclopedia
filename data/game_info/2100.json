But those games were fantastic shooters (Borderlands 1 - even with RPG elements), and this is a graphic adventure. The player controls two different characters: Fiona is a fraudster, and Reese is a programmer for Hyperion. Characters are found on the planet Pandora after the defeat of Handsome Jack. The story will show the common events of both characters in view of each of them.<br />\nEach character has its own unique abilities. For example, Fiona can steal and use the money, and Reese with the help of an implant and a cybernetic hand knows how to crack electronic devices and scan various elements.<br />\nThe game contains five episodes in which the player explores the outside world, communicates with non-player characters and interacts with the elements of the location, and also collects and uses various items. The choice and actions of the player in the initial episodes will affect the plot in later episodes. The game has a few shootouts too.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2015-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:23:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/264/2642b17a7885f7abc4fd018e98943242.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/talesfromtheborderlands/", "rating": 4.19, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 289, "owned": 3263, "beaten": 1031, "toplay": 143, "dropped": 163, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 251, "ratings_count": 1082, "suggestions_count": 638, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1090, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
