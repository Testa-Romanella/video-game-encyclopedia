{"id": 409512, "slug": "bastions-undertaking-demo", "name": "Bastions' Undertaking (DEMO)", "name_original": "Bastions' Undertaking (DEMO)", "description": "<p>It's just another typical day for Juro, out running an errand for his father, attempting to get an ingredient for his sickly mother's medicine. A trip through the nearby Haizae Forest not only brings him across his childhood friend Arae, but gives Juro the herb he was tasked with retrieving. Fast forward a bit and the duo are sent on another fetch quest, coming across a strange creature twice before finally returning home with another piece to Juro's mother's medicine. When the day is nearly concluded, Juro is met with tragedy, thrown into a new place where he comes across the fate of the world soon to come. Now, Juro has been told that he must go to the northeastern continent of Mizerv to check on one of the seven Bastions of Light and see what can be done to prevent the inevitable doom lingering over the world.</p>\n<p>This will be about all the plot offered in this demo, but, I assure you, there will be oh so much more if time and funds permit.</p>\n<p>The game itself is a 2D RPG title, with a Turn-Based battle system, however, it will not be so cookie-cutter. If you have played the demo already, you will know what I mean, but, since you're reading this, chances are you haven't jumped the gun just yet, so let me fill you in. Thanks to some great plugins found here on Itch.io there will be some quality improvements to the battle system, such as the turn identifier up at the top of the screen. Those who have delved in RPGs might have seen something like this before; a few blocks shown indicate who is next in line to act and how the flow of battle will go. As well as that, characters will have more unique animations for their abilities, meaning that they can actually move about the battlefield instead of standing in place like is customary for a lot of typical Turn-Based RPGs. The camera can also move during battle as well, giving a new breath of life and excitement to the battle system! Oh, one more thing I almost forgot to mention: there are no random encounters. I know that was a big gripe for a lot of RPGs, always walking around, enjoying your adventure, before randomly walking into a fight. Well, no need to worry about that here! In this title, all encounters are visible, meaning, you have to walk into them before the battle starts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With what is on the table out of the way,\u00a0I'd like to follow up by saying that I do plan on adding in quite a few different gimmicks that the player might be enticed by, such as:<br/></p>\n<p>+A fishing Mini-game</p>\n<p>+A well thought-out and useful crafting system for items and equipment</p>\n<p>+A slew of side quests that help expand the world, as well as the characters</p>\n<p>+New game +, and a bonus dungeon only available on New Game +</p>\n<p>+Level cap being above 99</p>\n<p>There are a few more, but those have already been popped into the demo, such as the warping function, the QTE Mini-game and the art of Synthesizing (basically using powder to permanently make your equipment better).</p>\n<p>With that, I think that's about all the describing I can think of up to this point. With that all being said, you all can rest assured that I already have all of the plot written out (vaguely, but enough to where I know the important plot points and can work in more detail into the dialogue sections) and I am committed to seeing this video game become a full release. As of now, funding is not a \"critical\" issue, but time is becoming a bit of an issue, so if you liked what you saw in this demo and would enjoy seeing it become a full game, it would mean a lot if you could follow me on Patreon, or even make a small donation here on Itch.io or even directly to my Paypal. Regardless, I do appreciate at least reading this massive wall of text I took forever typing out and even more so if you played through what little was given through my demo. I hope to see you later on and I hope you have a great time!</p>\n\n<p>Ways to reach me or offer your support:</p>\n<p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/Celvaa</p>\n<p>Paypal: paypal.me/Celvaa</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/CelvaaOfficial</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/Celvaa\u00a0</p>\n<p>(just in case you liked the few tracks you heard on the demo and wanted to hear more of my stuff, although I pretty much only do covers on the given youtube channel)</p>\n\n<p>A few tips:</p>\n<p>+I got word that a part of the victory theme is louder than the other music when the Background Music (BGM) volume is lowered. The reasoning is due to the first part of the victory jingle being listed as a Music Effect (ME). So, to prevent it from surprising you when the music is down, you may also want to lower the Music Effect volume as well.</p>\n<p>+I have noticed that it can be a bit difficult to find the \"flee\" or \"escape\" function while in battle. While in battle, when you are able to select attack, character specific abilities, and so on, simply click Escape/Esc on the keyboard to go back one menu where the option to flee/escape can be found.</p>\n<p>+Just to be nice, I thought I'd offer this little hint too: save crystals in dungeons or places like them (such as Haizae Forest, for example) instantly and completely heal your party every time you use them. This way you won't have to worry about running out of healing items at the end of an area and have to trek back to a town to restock or\u00a0being limited on healing items while stuck in a place you can't leave.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000ab2aaf97da6f4ea66fcbe99edac37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Celvaa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
