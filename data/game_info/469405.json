In this game you go through an invinite randomly generated dungeon. There you have to <strong>collect keys</strong> while <strong>avoiding all enemys</strong>. The controls are pretty straightforward with <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>the arrow keys</strong> to move and Escape to pause the game.</p>\n<p>The idea for this game came from a gamejam the Youtuber Miziziziz did in March 2020. There he had to build a roguelike in seven days but he did it in one. Me as a new game developer thought I could do it in one week but it ended up taking three months because I had problems with the enemys. (I really only worked two weeks on the game but with a big pause in the middle.)\r\n  </p>\n<p>I made this game with Unity. I only made a Mac and a Windows build if anyone wants a build for another OS just write a comment and I'll try to upload it.</p>\n<p>Please write any bugs, suggestions, problems, features or your highscore in the comments.</p>\n<p>PS: my Highscore is actually only level 6 and I died on the 824th move.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c86/c866e23ada452cb096a31ff3bcf7233a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LeanderDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
