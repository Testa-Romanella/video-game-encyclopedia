Others ... not so much.<br/>Feel free to design your own.<br/>Sometimes you will need to build bridges to reach your destination. Or it may be strategically useful to excavate tunnels or caves ... or to blow up a mountain.<br/>With more dimensions come more strategic options for you to exploit, but also more paths for your opponents to avoid your defenses.<br/>Resources never deplete, but the quest for ever more also never ends. And literally undermining someone else's mines can be surprisingly effective.<br/><br/>In Hexaverse, good offense and defense requires diversity and cleverness. You typically don't build huge armies here, much less of only one type. Every single unit matters. A few artillery tanks in just the right spots might do all the damage you need. If that doesn't work, try nuking from sub-orbit.<br/>Be careful, though, not to rely on the unseen to remain as it appears.<br/>You never quite know when your enemies just might have planted a big bomb beneath your main base ... a few rounds before you installed that subsurface scanner.<br/><br/>Try to see everything, exploit what others can't see, for they will try to do the same to you.<br/>If only that was all that mattered...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8d6cb3082c40ab1a0234be2a09d02c.jpg", "website": "https://www.hexaverse.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stefan Elsen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Stefan Elsen"], "esrb_rating": null}
