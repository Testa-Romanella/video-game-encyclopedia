This time I used a different approach by making it have more freedom and fun gameplay. I learnt my previous mistakes for being unfun\u00a0and quite boring, so I decided in this game you can massacre anyone as you wish. This is also quite a tough week for me, since I have a test (I'm a student btw) during this week so I wasn't able to complete most of the original plan. Hopefully I'll do it better in the next Ludum Dare!\r\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- For full experience, download the game in the download button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/8510fe89769caebc7e277b195770c795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["king72dragoness"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
