Done in an oldschool style, this could easily be an Atari 2600 game. Use the left and right arrows to move, control to shoot, enter to begin, and escape if you give up. It's free, so why not make an attempt at beating the hardest space shooter in the universe?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T05:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca7f004d318d791ea23b482c349f2573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ambush"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
