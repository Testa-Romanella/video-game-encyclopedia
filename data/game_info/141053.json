Press R to restart and get a new Monolith. Use the green cubes as hints as to where you can go. Sometimes the path generation curls in on itself so the green cubes can be a red herring.</p>\n<p>Sometimes finding a way up will be really difficult. It may look like there is no way forward but there probably is one. If you get stuck you can fly up to the next level and find a way down to see the path you were meant to take up.</p>\n\r\nHow the Procedural Generation Works:\r\n<p>First, I\u00a0generate cubes randomly within a large box, the probability of cubes spawning decreases\u00a0the closer it was to the edges of the box.</p>\n<p>Next, a sphere goes around more or less randomly inside the Monolith. It'll tend to go upwards more than downwards and it'll never form a path that asks the player to jump two blocks high. As it goes, it deletes any blocks in its path and lays down blocks below as needed (those are the green cubes), making sure that it doesn't accidentally block the way up in the process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6c5ed39de0b31e6c5a480c8b171fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["RahulJoshi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
