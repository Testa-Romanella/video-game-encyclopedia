These light organs contain luminous bacteria and can be \"shut off\" by the fish using either a dark lid or by being drawn into a pouch.<br/></p>\n<p>-Game Requirements-</p>\n\n<p>Purpose:</p>\n<p>The world is a place that may have attributes and effects. The world is not static, it can shift and\u00a0change.</p>\n<p>Tasks\u00a0Required:</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0The environment must change:</p>\n<p>- Perhaps the scene can turn from day to night. Or trees<br/>can grow, creating a forest where there was just a field. Or a black hole forms, creating gravity for all objects where there was none. Is this environmental change caused by a timer, the interaction of objects, something else?</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0There must be some form of UI</p>\n<p>- A button should exist and do something to the game,\u00a0whether it\u2019s affecting a player or changing the world state.</p>\n<p>\u25cfThere must be two objects in the world</p>\n<p>- You must have at least two objects with behaviors. At least one of these objects must be affected by the world state. (E.g. a vampire can barely move during the day, but now can bite victims at night.)</p>\n<p>Encouraged:</p>\n<p>\u25cfTheme</p>\n<p>- Tell me a story? Is there a character? Multiple characters? Is there a challenge?<br/>A place I want to be? Can I succeed?</p>\n<p>\u25cfTwo end states</p>\n<p>- What about outcomes? What if I go south instead of north? What if I<br/>sit in the same place or instead get too far from my friend?</p>\n<p>\u25cfAudio</p>\n<p>- You may add music and audio if you\u2019d like.</p>\n<p>Not Allowed:</p>\n<p>\u25cfCamera Movement</p>\n<p>- The camera must stay stationary.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fad385f06e39b0985127e52a5cbfdc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rynlere"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
