{"id": 378428, "slug": "promnesia", "name": "Promnesia", "name_original": "Promnesia", "description": "<p>Promnesia is more of a suspense built game rather than a traditional horror game. The game is extremely short as it's meant to be a free short-game and my first published title. However, I know it has some bugs and wanted to gather helpful information from the public before actually posting it on Steam. I'd love to hear everyone's experiences and ideas on how to improve this short-game. The story still needs work, which is what I'm currently polishing at the moment. If you download it and play it, thank you so much for taking the time to play my creation. It means the world to me!</p><p>\u00a0P.S. The game is completely free, donations are only optional but not expected. Donations are accepted here or at my patreon.</p><p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/TheHiveInc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T05:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fefd48ae531e38a406307c75f82bf776.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Clark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
