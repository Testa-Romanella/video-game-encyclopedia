Rest assured, the levels get incrementally harder as you go.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n The game has a built-in Path editor.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Paths can be added and deleted.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The nodes for each path can be moved / added / and deleted.\r\n  For this version, only five (5) levels will be released.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There is currently three (3) creatures, for the contest.\r\n Four turret types have been made available.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n Last but not least.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Have FUN, FUN, FUN\u00a0 and ENJOY!!!   \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cbec28996a9765f508f034905917b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["GasiusGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
