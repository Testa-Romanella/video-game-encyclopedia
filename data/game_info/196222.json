For this project we were tasked with making a game by ourselves, with no programmers or artists working with us. As such, I decided to learn Unreal Engine for this project, which ended up working out really well, once I got past the initial learning curve. While the final prototype is really basic, I learned a lot from the project so I am very happy with it.
