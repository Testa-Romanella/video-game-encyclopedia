To survive, the must show their wisdom and solve the traps inside the labyrinth, all while avoiding the minotaurs. Their goal is to reach the last room, where the exit will be shown and they can finally be free. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Inspired by the classic MS-DOS game \u201cThe Beast\u201d, we have created a game with new graphics and game modes. Playing The Minotaur you will feel the nostalgia for those old school games where your only goal was to get as far as possible or the highest score. The game also has full gamepad compatibility, so do not worry if you don\u2019t like playing on keyboard ;) <br/><br/>The Minotaur also includes several game modes: <br/><br/><strong>Arcade: </strong><br/>It\u2019s the classic mode, where the player has to fight his way through 30 levels with increasing difficulty, including different minotaurs, minotaur eggs, etc. <br/><br/><strong>Time Attack:</strong> <br/>Similar to Arcade, the player needs to finish the level all 30 levels in a certain amount of time. Killing the minotaurs or their eggs will grant extra time. <br/><br/><strong>Endless:</strong> <br/>If you think you beat the game, try this mode with the endless levels. Really, this mode never end!<br/><br/><strong>One Life</strong><br/>You are the untouchable human? Demonstrate that with this mode where you die by one hit.<br/><br/><strong>Local Co-op: </strong><br/>If you have trouble defeating the beasts, ask a friend for help! Or a family member, or maybe even your dog can help you. Up to four players, so the more the merrier. <br/><br/><strong>Local VS </strong><br/>This game mode allows the players to fight against themselves. Great for challenging your friends and competing to be the very best, or simply relax by killing your acquaintances. <br/><br/><strong>Trials: </strong><br/>Players will need to find their ways through a series of hand-made levels. Some of them might even have only four blocks to kill the minotaurs (\u0e07\ufe21'-'\ufe20)\u0e07. <br/><br/><strong>Level Editor: </strong><br/>Tired of playing the classic levels? Bored by the challenges? No problem, you will be able to create your own level maps.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T17:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c216a8910e93af9ff1a23ac637711a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.82, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 270, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ratalaika Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ratalaika Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
