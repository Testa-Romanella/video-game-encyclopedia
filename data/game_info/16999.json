Featuring a vast arsenal of badass weaponry including saw blades, dual-wielded shotguns from 1887 and an incredibly necessary grenade launcher, DUSK is unapologetic retro action from start to finish.<br />\nIn addition to the main campaign, DUSK features an Endless Survival Mode, putting you front and center of wave after wave of enemies. For those looking for an extra challenge, DUSK offers the chance to go head to head online to battle your friends in arena multiplayer, where darkness hosts the worst of humanity in surprising new ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T14:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/613/6131ede941efcfbb0858e80b2f4ec6bc.jpg", "website": "http://www.NewBlood.info", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1012, "beaten": 133, "toplay": 99, "dropped": 65, "playing": 35}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 217, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 221, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["David Szymanski"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New Blood Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
