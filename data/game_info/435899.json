The theme is \u2018Summit\u2019 and the limitations are the WASD and Arrow keys are the only controllers allowed to be used. Thankyou to the hosts, ZahranW and KingW, for hosting this 72-hour Jam!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Shoot zombies, skeletons, and other fun creatures in this 2D, pixel top-down shooter created primarily in Unity. Restricted to the WASD and Arrow keys, this leads to some interesting shenanigans in terms of button pressing and accuracy, but try your best!</p>\n<p>Yes, there\u00a0<em>is</em> a top of the mountain, you just have to keep trying! Updates may be rolling out in the future based on the community's response.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated.
