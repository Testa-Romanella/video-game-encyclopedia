It's also unclear how the Lemuria 7 has returned and why it has been seriously damaged.<br/><br/>In Lemuria: Lost in Space, you play as Abrix - the robot with AI that may operate in extreme temperatures, high levels of radiation and that yields weapon and hacking modules in order to explore the whole ship.<br/><br/><br/>Abrix has an ability to overrun security systems. The unique hacking mini-game will challenge your math, geographic and logical thinking skills. There is no time to check Wikipedia - every mistake costs you valuable resources!<br/><br/>Abrix has a special software that allows him to upgrade himself during the mission. You need to be very careful - if you run out of batteries or an anti-radiation cloak, the mission is aborted and the game is over.<br/><br/><br/>In order to explore over 100 rooms of the spaceship, you'll need to solve dozens of puzzles, find valuable resources for the robot and fight with security turrets and other enemies patrolling the ship.<br/><br/>Solving puzzles not only rewards you with priceless resources, but also uncovers the story of the lost crew of Lemuria 7. The level of challenge depends on difficulty - so choose wisely or you'll need to start from scratch.<br/><br/><strong>The game demo is available now!</strong><br/><br/><strong>FAQ</strong><br/>Q - What is the diffrence between this game and original \"Lemuria: Lost in Space\"? <br/>A - VR edition is remastered in many ways and now it contains:<br/>  - Free first person movement with WASD and controller support,<br/>  - Full HTC Vive VR support with intuitive GUI, smart teleportation system, very easy and ready to play fighting system<br/>  - Easier to use items<br/>  - Bug fixes <br/><br/>Q - My HTC Vive controllers are not working.<br/>A - Turn off the game, go to SteamVR and make sure that controllers are on.
