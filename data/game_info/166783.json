Simplistic Idle 's first release was created in 1 hour as a small idea that was later edited and added to Itch.io with the intent of adding more content for fun.</p>\n<p>The reason I made it in a classic window is because I was sick of all the UI based games that used there own resources that didn't look that good and hurt the eyes, kudos to those who do make/draw good textures.<br/></p>\n<p>The Cache generates an upgradable amount of credits every moment up until it hits an upgradable maximum. At any point in time any credits inside the cache can be collected and added to your total balance.</p>\n<p>The Actions tab generates an upgradable amount of credits and adds it directly to your balance  every moment until it hits zero. At any point in time you can refresh your actions and they will be set to an upgradable maximum.</p>\n<p>If you have any reasonable ideas for new features or want to report any bugs be sure to let me know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/99154ea61db9caf562ec23c27142d987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Puls3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
