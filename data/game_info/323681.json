A world where time and space itself is\u00a0</em><em>contorted and twisted, everybody and everything is now a complex mix of digital and physical\u00a0</em><em>genetic code. A world, where old and new civilisations clash. This! Is Katabasis.</em>'</p>\n<p>&gt; Run Rashmon.exe is set in a collapsing world of juxtaposed medieval and futuristic culture and technology. In the far future the dreaded zealot known as the Oni has opened a breach to a virtual hell through which digital demons have overrun the surrounding lands. This has left the city of Kyoto as the last safe haven for humans.</p>\n<p>The game is a singleplayer action roleplaying game (RPG) featuring squad management and simulation mechanics. The player rotationally controls a band of cyberpunk detectives known as the 'Neo-Nytes', tasked with defending the realm by hunting, planning, investigating and any other means necessary. This digital prototype is the product of undergraduate\u00a0group work across a semester of sprints using Scrum methodology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Designed and developed\u00a0by:</p>\n<p>Sam Pickard\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry Prebble\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phill Shaw\u00a0</p>\n<p>James Nowlan\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T05:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f4947ad02b197e6fcf81d7a2a2a38a2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phill Shaw", "Sam Pickard", "Two Sides of a Melon", "James Nowlan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
