It uses authentic pilot voices.<br/><br/>This app is designed to give aviation enthusiasts a taste of the world's greatest job. The radar behaviour in this app is identical to that of real-world air traffic control radar screens, utilizing a 3-second sweep that air traffic controllers are accustomed to. Much work has been done to make such a complex job fit inside the palm of your hand.<br/><br/>You are the approach controller whose job is to manage arriving passenger jets at various busy airports. Establish arriving aircraft onto 'final approach' as safely and efficiently as possible. As in the real world of ATC, you must walk a very fine line between being cautious and being expeditious. A top notch air traffic controller knows how to bring planes in 'tight', without breaking the 'three mile rule'.<br/><br/>Keep all aircraft at least THREE MILES apart or at least 1000 FEET VERTICALLY apart. That's your job in a nutshell! Earn extra points by establishing the planes onto final approach without extra wasted space.<br/><br/>Air traffic controlling is achieved by assigning a mixture of three things: HEADING, SPEED, and ALTITUDE. Use these three tools to achieve safety and efficiency.<br/><br/>A successful air traffic controller must remain CALM, COOL and COLLECTED, known as the 'three C's'. Who knows, you may one day use these skills and apply for a real ATC job! Find out why real-world air traffic controllers have nerves of steel. <br/><br/>This is the FULL VERSION of Approach Control, which offers four challenging airport maps.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a316e367c367fc06a0c70e407f28d5f1.jpg", "website": "http://www.bigfatsimulations.com/game/approachcontrol", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
