After completing 10 levels, a final boss appears and killing the final boss completes the run.\u00a0An online leaderboard is included to display your high score in comparison to others.\u00a0<br/><br/>While I created the majority of the different elements in the game, I relied on the game development community for some of the assets. All of my sources are properly licensed and listed under \"Credits\" in the Options menu. Huge thank you to everyone who releases free and affordable assets for small indie devs to use in their games!<br/><br/>A complete run is usually around ~15 minutes. Hope you enjoy :)<br/><br/>I\u00a0plan on adding controller compatibility in the next update. As always, feel free to comment with any ideas or criticisms- I'm always open to feedback.<br/><br/><strong>UPDATE 4/16:\u00a0</strong><br/>- Changed the tiling colors for less visual overload<br/>- Slowed the jump for a smoother feel<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T11:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca082c2fa8c37962f4193b42b48f4e07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beh3D"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
