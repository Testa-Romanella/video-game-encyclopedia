There's lakes, mountains, woods and a few other features.\u00a0 You have a few different abilities. You can set things on fire, strike things with lightning and morph the world around you. Basically you get to <strong>play God.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>More possibilities...</strong></p>\n<p>You can change brush size and create your own world and use the tools\u00a0to experiment with the different laws of this sandbox. There are many many new features coming for this game so if you want anything added just leave a comment and I will try and implement it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arson</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most fun things to do in the game is to burn everything you have built. Just watching the natural cycle of things is sort of therapeutic as you light something on fire, it turn to ash, return to dirt and then watching grass and plants growing again just for another fire to destroy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T10:00:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b8/6b8b1f79a743984d403cd6ddccc1030d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimJomBro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
