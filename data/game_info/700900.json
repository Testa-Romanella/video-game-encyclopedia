{"id": 700900, "slug": "super-adventure-boy", "name": "Super Adventure Boy", "name_original": "Super Adventure Boy", "description": "<p>*Please read the controls, as they can be very confusing!*</p>\r\nMade for Lost Cartridge Jam 2021\r\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>The game tells you what to do, as if it was an NES. So It says, \"Press Start\" or \"Press A\" To make the game feel comfortable on a keyboard I have set up the controls in an unconventional way, so read this before playing:</p>\n<p>PS: Gamepad support might be added in the future!</p>\n<p>D-pad - WASD / Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Start - Z / X</p>\n<p>A - E / Enter</p>\n<p>B - Shift / Space</p>\n<p>You move via the D-pad, you shoot via B, You jump with UP, you duck via DOWN\u00a0and you navigate the menus with A.</p>\r\n\r\nBut what is the game about?\r\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by Ducktales for NES. You can choose between a jungle plain and an ancient pyramid in egypt where you'll head to collect money! Why? Well, nobody knows the answer to that question... Also don't forget to break open chests to find ammunition and health.</p>\n\n<p>If the game seems unfinished, then because it is... I heavily overestimated how much work I could get done... You shouldn't encounter any bugs, that break the game but if you see anything, please let me know! I really liked working on theis and would hope to make this into a bigger game soon!</p>\n<p>Until then, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cc/1ccf4a6cba8ac838917de26c061408bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ENDOBLANCE"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
