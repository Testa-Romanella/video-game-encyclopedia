{"id": 376007, "slug": "fracteria", "name": "Fracteria", "name_original": "Fracteria", "description": "What is this game?\r\n<p>Fracteria is a fantasy RPG inspired by vaguely remembered games from the 90s. The story starts in the kingdom of Fracteria: a country ripped apart by a volcanic eruption and the loss of an overseas war. Ash is a guard working closely with Fracteria's king and is tasked in hunting down a deserter of his army. But that isn't what this story is about: it's an exploration into the interpersonal relationships of a group of lost and lonely 20-somethings as they try to navigate personal meaning and a fantasy world full of monsters and ancient prophecies. Dragons, love, revenge and betrayal are all here for your enjoyment!</p>\n<p>This demo follows the first chapter of 3 introducing the main characters. After that is the 4th chapter that opens up the world to explore. Currently the game is about 1hr long, but expect a playtime of around 3hrs when the rest of the 3 chapters are complete. I have no plans for how long the 4th chapter will be, but expect at least another 3hrs, probably longer.<br/></p>\n<p>You can follow development of Fracteria and other creations by me on my twitter: https://twitter.com/cortopdev<br/></p>\n<em>Why</em> is this game?\r\n<p>As the tagline suggests, this is a character-driven RPG that brings stuff that I like from games like Final Fantasy 4 &amp; 6, Dragon Quest 4 &amp; 5 and anything else that unconsciously flopped off my nostalgia-addled brain and into this game. It is in stark contrast to the high concept (ish) games I usually design, but expect some fun stuff and a bunch of puzzles to break up the usual JRPG flow.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a simple game with lots of text, that is my tribute to all those self-indulgent, angsty rpg maker games! Well, not really, but a wise man once said, \"<em>if you love something enough, then you shouldn't take it seriously.</em>\" That's my ethos for this game.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm having fun pouring whatever I like into this without worrying too much. It's a very selfish game, but I want to share it anyway. Maybe someone will get something out of it!</p>\n<p>By the way, don't bother keeping your savefiles for the next part, because it's very likely they wont be compatible. I'll provide a savefile that starts at the next chapter when I release it.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Please read this post for full credits: https://cortopdev.itch.io/fracteria/devlog/100348/full-credits-for-fracteria-dem...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T07:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/771db7f6017b34ef1e1e9319129fa110.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cortopdev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
