Though I plan to release this game for free I plan to give a small bonus to everyone who bought it. Thank you for supporting indie game developers.</p>\n<p>The game is still a work in progress but more updates are planned. I hope to have the game finished in twoish weeks but with the holidays coming up please don\u2019t be surprised if I take a bit longer<strong>.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The final game will be made in unity, this a work in progress. All art assets will eventually be replaced. I hope you can forgive any errors, awkwardness, or notes in the game.
