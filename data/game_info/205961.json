Player 2 uses the arrow keys to move around and can shoot by clicking the left mouse button.</p><p>I wanted to put a shield mechanic in for Player 1 that would block all of Player 2's bullets for 3 seconds but I could not figure out how to make it work.</p><p>I wanted to design the game so that while Player 2 had better range than Player 1, Player 1 had moving platforms that would block Player 2's shots as well as impede Player 2 from getting to close to Player 1. I believe this would balance the game so that both players could have more fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff76acf9724f2b39338f22675e9a70eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DavidSantos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
