Public Official is inspired of personnal confusion with French Administration (do you know the scene in The Twelve Tasks of Asterix where the team has to find the A38 pass ?). The more you progress in the game, the more it glitches. Also, you have time limitation. How many ? I don't know, i lost it in my documents.</p>\n<p>In retrospect (2019), I can't play this game without focusing on errors or mistaskes I made in programmation or general design. So the game is \"as it was\" unpretencious, in 2013.</p>\n<p>Controls :<br/>- Arrows or Joystick to move<br/>- Space or A Button on Xbox controller to jump<br/>- Left Alt or X Button to shoot with the gun. You don't have it at the begining.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/1208b76b007f459dbc1b2d9d9122fb9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R\u00e9my Sohier"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
