(Solo project)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 I decided to use the story about my older brother and me; as we were both mad gamers from childhood and we used to fight for the one and only computer at home all the time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The game's objective is simple: Push your brother away from the desk.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0But of course, it won't be realistic if it was that easy. In order to push your brother away from the computer, you must first explore the house and find things that can increase your push power. (You can still try spamming space though, just don't break your finger.)</p><p>\u00a0By taking each action (or item) you will trigger certain interaction with your brother\u00a0which will always result in his\u00a0annoyed reaction (but he will never leave the computer on his own.).</p>\n<p>Once you successfully push your brother away, you will get access to the computer and play a mini-game called 'Jumpy slime' , which is a simple game I made based on Doodle Jump--\u00a0(it may\u00a0be differently named by the player at the intro).</p>\n<p>[**'Option' and 'Help' in Main menu are not implemented yet.**]</p>\n<p>Comment:</p>\n<p>Making the game's been quite fun, as I had to look back upon my childhood memory and think about how I\u00a0used to annoy my brother when he didn't let me use the computer. Although the game is based on my personal experience,\u00a0I hope this game can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of whether they\u00a0have siblings.</p>\n\n<p>Any questions, suggestions, please email me at: 1010215@student.sae.edu.au .</p>\n<p>To those who have played this game:\u00a0If you could please participate in this short survey here:\u00a0 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfe6U4mf8tYkiiOGe91sGR0wVXHhtXouo3kePxS...\u00a0it will be very appreciated &amp; also of\u00a0great help to improve in the future version of\u00a0the game!
