The cops are hitting the business hard however so you decide to sell your goods under the cover of hip hop, metal and opera concerts.</p>\n<p>You want to make your potential buyers associate different music genres with candy\u00a0selling while keeping the cops off your tail by fooling them into associating the wrong genres with candy selling.<br/></p>\n<p>This unfortunately never made it into the game. Buyers can supposedly buy candy at your concerts but you as the player have no means of supplying the concerts with anything <em>to </em>buy. Buyers and cops may also associate candy with different genres but even if that is the case it is not noticeable. This is because while the UI is mostly complete it was never successfully hooked up to the game state. This excludes the hotbar at the bottom however...<br/></p>\r\nPlaying instructions\r\n<p>Pick a band by selecting their van either by left-clicking it in the hotbar or pressing the corresponding key. Then select a building (other than the blue police station and your green HQ) in which to hold a concert by right-clicking it. This will start a rave-like concert drawing in both potential buyers and cops. (Neither\u00a0of which will ever find any candy)</p>\n<p>Hip hop bands use yellow vans, rock bands red and opera bands blue. Pro tip: Be careful with hip hop concerts, they can really hurt your ears.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Select van</strong> | Left-click in hotbar or keys 1\u20139<br/><strong>Select destination </strong>| Right-click on a building<br/><strong>Move camera\u00a0</strong>| W, A, S, D or arrow keys<br/><strong>Force-quit game</strong>\u00a0| Alt + F4\u00a0<strong>[</strong><strong>NOTE: Not in the browser version!]</strong><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Axel Nordanskog</strong>programming, 2D sprites<strong>Erik Mans\u00e9n</strong>programming<br/><strong>Mattias Lindblad</strong>UI<strong>Rasmus Larsson</strong>programming<strong>Theodor Bourelius</strong>programming, music, ripple effects", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3dbaee5022f4f411d7e908507349252b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Axerosh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
