{"id": 314364, "slug": "honey-beats", "name": "Honey Beats", "name_original": "Honey Beats", "description": "<p>Honey Beats is a rhtyhm co-op game, in which two players control brave and lively bees to repel an attack of hostile insects and defend the hive. The players do not only count on their powerful lasers, but more importantly, on themselves! By moving\u00a0to the rhythm of the music, the players have to defeat enemies and watch each other's backs, paying attention to the shared score multiplier or insects that require a coordinated attack. No cooperation, no success. This is no place for lone bees!</p>\n<p>A slightly improved version of a game prototype\u00a0created in\u00a040 hours for Game Jam Square, Warsaw 26-28 April 2019.\u00a0<br/>The project won Grand Prix and Best Sound Design award.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Content used:</p>\n<p>Kevin MacLeod \u2013 \u201cTheme for Harold var 1\u201d, \u201cSpazzmatica Polka\u201d, \u201cSilly Fun\u201d, \u201cPinball Spring\u201d, \u201cPixel Peeker Polka \u2013 slower\u201d:\u00a0https://incompetech.com/\u00a0<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Sound effects:\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/</p>\n<p>exCamera,\u00a0by alexandervrs:\u00a0\r\nhttps://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/504/excamera\u00a0</p>\n<p>jeti \u2013 Digital Disco:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/digital-disco.font\u00a0<br/>Licensed under CC BY 4.0:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Game jam gameplay video</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/786/786a5fe9329368bede7a6cae525b5dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Color Fuel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
