The Labyrinth is not like any place you have ever visited or will visit. It defies all logic and reasoning. There are walls that you are able to phase right through. I discovered this phenomenon and am now trapped because I cannot find the exit. Please make sure you figure out how to find fake walls, they are the only thing blocking you from finding the Golden Chalice.</p>\n<p>Please do what I could not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Signed,</p>\n<p>Jones Praw the Adventurer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:43:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/049b98818092731043e4a3b317ba52f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CBMakes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
