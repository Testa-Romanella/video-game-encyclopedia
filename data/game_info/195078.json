Was supposed to be scary or spooky :)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>mouse click - place summoning portal (costs 100 mana)</p>\n<p>mouse scroll - zoom in</p>\n<p>way-point keys - camera movement</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>Kill all the solders</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>Games is a reverse tower defense. You can place summoning portals across the map (if you have mana)\u00a0that will constantly spawn minions. Minions will have to hit solders many times to defeat them. There is a time limit too, so place your portals wisely!</p>\n<p>Game was made by entangling together many, many free assets, models and sounds. Also, loots of spaghetti code was produced due to insufficient time investment :). Due to a considerable feature cuts to catch the deadline game turned out kinda dumb.\u00a0I didn't do much play-testing either :). There were supposed to be upgradable summoning portals, garrison toggling, multiple different minion types and solder promotions if/when they killed enough minions.</p>\n<p>Oh well... at least its something!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd369360813ed824a79effeec31208b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kren3"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
