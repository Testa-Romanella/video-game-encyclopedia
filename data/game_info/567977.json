Sadly it was never found out what happened to said village. However that isn't the case as one person does know, but vanished from the public. Years later a young solider discovers a mysterious group of demons that plan on wiping out everyone in sight for food supply and decides to face off against them. The only way to get rid of the demons however, is to cast a spell that forces them to leave the world.
