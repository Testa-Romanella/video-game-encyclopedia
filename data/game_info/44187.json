There was a malfunction that we can\u2019t fix yet, but with your help I can make symptoms bearable. We\u2019re all in the same boat here and should help each other.\"<br/><br/>\"I\u2019m Shelly, a lead scientist in General Education research facility. The job title is longer, but it\u2019s not important. Here\u2019s what I know so far, though.\"<br/><br/>\"The experience-sharing program that we were studying went haywire. Maybe it\u2019s that black box, maybe something else. The main symptom for you is that your nightmares and dreams no longer require sleeping to manifest. These hallucinations is all your subconscious. It turns out that given enough time with it, we go insane. But we can fix that.\"<br/><br/>The Long Reach is an adventure game filled with colorful characters, puzzles, and a shock of discovery. Wait, weren't we supposed to say \u201cjoy of discovery\u201d? That can\u2019t be right.<br/><br/>The Long Reach takes place in New Hampshire, in the fictional town of Baervox. The game draws its inspiration from Lone Survivor and The Cave and all the classical adventures (except that The Long Reach is set in the present day). You don't play in a post-apocalyptic world or explore a fairy-filled fantasy world. You\u2019re in the thick of it, just around the corner from the place where you buy your groceries.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Long Reach is a horror-thriller hell bent on screwing with your perception of things.<br/></li><li>The game misuses stunning pixel art to create gruesome and unsettling images.<br/></li><li>You\u2019ll be playing as Calvin throughout the game -  this is an example of the lies and deception that we have in store for you.<br/></li><li>You won\u2019t be forced to figure everything out. Escape if you wish, in fact we encourage you to run for your life!<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles that require thinking outside the box. The box provided by our publisher was never used during the development.<br/></li><li>You\u2019ll be able to talk with plenty of characters. In fact, you\u2019ll have a chance to pitch in every five lines or so.<br/></li><li>A classic adventure game inventory filled with keys and weird stuff (note: no Elvish swords glowing faintly blue when evil is close in this game).<br/></li><li>Original atmospheric and haunting soundtrack. The composer's not right in the head, he brought weird stuff home to use in the soundtrack. We\u2019re all concerned for his cat.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T07:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44cda3bae9ffa992cd9fd9f57726bfd8.jpg", "website": "http://thelongreachgame.com", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 230, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 121, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC", "Linux", "macOS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Merge Games", "Painted Black Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Merge Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
