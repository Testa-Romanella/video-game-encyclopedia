Be careful however, one wrong note will send your friend plummeting down the song chart, ricocheting off of the unfortunately shaped notes.</p>\n<p>There is a known issue where the four channels are not bound to keys unless you go to the 'Rebind' menu option and set them first. This is fixed in the GitHub Release!</p>\n<p>To navigate the menu use Up/W, Down/S, and Space!</p>\n<p>The code for Up Beat is available on GitHub!</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>If you don't click Rebind and enter the 4 keys you desire the keyboard bindings get incorrectly unbound. Fixed in GitHub Release</li><li>European machines that use ',' not '.' in their decimal numbers will incorrectly parse the song's offset, resulting in no notes appearing for 27 minutes. Fixed in GitHub Release</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All art, programming, song charting, and design were done by PhantomBadger - Check me out on\u00a0Twitter!</p>\n<p>The song used is \"1/2\" by \"x\u9ae5\u838f\" and is perfectly OK for streamers and other content creators! It can be listened to on YouTube here:\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n<p>I made this game to try and match what I saw as the main tenants of a Foddian game;</p>\n<ul><li>Failure is the players fault, and this is communicated to them!</li><li>Failure can compound into dramatic events</li><li>Failure rewinds progress for the player</li><li>Players should be able to improve at it</li><li>The difficulty curve is very punishing</li></ul>\n<p>I believe Up Beat meets most of these rules, the latter-most one being the trickiest to tick off due to the varying level of player's skills when it comes to rhythm games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992d3aa9a03a5dafd07f3e6993a587bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhantomBadger"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
