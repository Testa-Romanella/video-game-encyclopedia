The objective is to get the fewest number of points among the players.\r\nThe game ends when one player accumulates 80 points or more, and the player with the lowest score is declared the winner.\r\nIf the lowest score is a tie, then all players with that score win.\r\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\r\n\u2551 THE DECK \u2551\r\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\r\nThe game of Straights uses a standard 52-card deck, without the jokers. Each player is dealt 13 cards at the beginning of each round.\r\nIn this game, the Ace is considered the lowest card in each suit (rank of 1), while the King is the highest (rank of 13).\r\nA Jack has a rank of 11, while the Queen has a rank of 12. The rank of all other cards is their numeric value e.g., 2 has a rank of 2.\r\nThis game uses 1 for Ace, T for 10, J for Jack, Q for Queen, and K for King. The codename for the cards of the deck are as follows:\r\nClubs:    1C 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC\r\nDiamonds: 1D 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D TD JD QD KD\r\nHearts:   1H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H TH JH QH KH\r\nSpades:   1S 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS\r\nYou must use these codenames while playing or discarding the respective cards.\r\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\r\n\u2551 GAMEPLAY \u2551\r\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\r\n \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\r\n \u2502 LEGAL PLAYS \u2502\r\n \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\r\nImmediately following the deal, the player with the 7 of spades goes first.\r\nThis player must play the 7 of spades in the centre of the table. After the 7 of spades, the players take turns playing cards on the table.\r\nAt this point, the players must play cards that constitute legal plays. The following cards are legal:\r\n* A 7 of any suit. This card starts a new pile on the table.\r\n* A card with the same suit and adjacent rank (2A card has adjacent rank if its face value is one more or one less than the rank of the card under consideration.\r\nThe King and Ace of a suit are not considered to be adjacent ranks to each other.) as another card that has already been played.\r\nIt must be played on the pile of the appropriate suit. (Note that the \u201cpile\u201d is spread across the table so that that play can proceed at either end.)\r\nFor example, if the 7 of spades is the only card on the table, then the legal plays are the 7 of diamonds, the 7 of hearts, the 7 of clubs, the 8 of spades, and the 6 of spades. Once the 8 of spades is played, the next legal plays are the 9 of spades, the 6 of spades, the 7 of diamonds, the 7 of hearts, and the 7 of clubs.\r\n \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\r\n \u2502 DISCARDS \u2502\r\n \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\r\nWhen a player has no legal plays, they must then choose a card in their hand, and place it face down in front of them. This is a discard.\r\nNote that if a player has at least one legal play in their hand, then they must make a legal play; they may not discard in this case.\r\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\r\n\u2551 SCORING \u2551\r\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\r\nThe round ends when all the cards have either been played or discarded. For each player, their score for the round is the sum of all the ranks of the player\u2019s discards.\r\nJacks, Queens, and Kings count as 11, 12, and 13 points, respectively. For example, if a player discarded an Ace, a Six, and a King, the number of points would be 1 + 6 + 13 = 20.\r\nEach player\u2019s game score is of the sum of their scores in each round. If no player has accumulated 80 or more points at the end of a round, then the deck is reshuffled and another round begins.\r\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\r\n\u2551 COMMANDS \u2551\r\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\r\nplay &lt;card&gt;                           plays the card.
