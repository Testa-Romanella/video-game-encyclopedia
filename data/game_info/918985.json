The global crisis<br/>finally arrived and the opportunities are rare. <br/></p>\n<p>One day, while drinking in a tavern, after another interview that was not so good, you saw an advertisement saying that the High King was looking<br/>for a mercenary to guard his private treasure tower. Without hesitation you apply for the opportunity.<br/></p>\n<p>In the interview you discover why the spot was open. Since there are high value items inside the tower, during the night enemies attack the tower to try to steal the money, and the King, as a good penny-pincher, wants only one person to guard it. But since you need money to pay for that brand new horse you got, you accept the challenge.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Engine: Unity     \r\n<br/></strong><strong>Status: </strong>Released<br/><strong>Release: </strong>31th January 2023<br/><strong>Version</strong>: 1.0.0(81)<br/><br/>This game was produced for the <em><strong>Tavern Game Jam: January Edition</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T14:30:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f2e3493df2d9fd2945807f4b9a912e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Andr\u00e9 Servidoni"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
