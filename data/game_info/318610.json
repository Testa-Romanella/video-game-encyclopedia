The game makes use of this setting to create stealth-based platformer obstacles.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Purple:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Not only is purple the main color scheme in the game, but is also used along with the stealth mechanics to create Camouflage, in which the player turns purple and allows them to sneak by guards. This only works however when paired against a wall of the same color.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Jumping is used as the main method for moving around. The game features several platformer-heavy sections that require creative use of the jump mechanic to grab onto walls.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Wham! Sounds:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>The game puts heavy enfasis on onomatopoeic sounds, making it part of its style to visualize the sounds themselves when the player realizes actions, such as fighting, dying or just moving around.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Art, music and programming made by me during the Jam period.</em></p>\n<p><em>Sounds by me and Creative Commons 0 sources.</em></p>\n<p><em>Robot Hit Sound by seachangeau (CC3):\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/seachangeau/sounds/426180/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T03:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805ba2b81afbcfed5f0c223aa94b52ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThanielPIN"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
