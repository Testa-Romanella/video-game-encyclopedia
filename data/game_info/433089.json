Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily \"Hesperioidea\"), and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily \"Hedyloidea\"). Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.\"\" wikipedia</p>\n\n\n<p>This quiz game is based on wikipedia material: Just guess butterflies famillies ...for fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a895af6596203fbacefae5355600828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ride2"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
