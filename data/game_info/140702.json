Each has it\u2019s own unique abilities. The player must send each colored homy to it\u2019s corresponding \u2018home\u2019 before time runs out. If time runs out, the \u2018Try Again\u2019 screen will show up and the player can continue or quit. Continuing will deduct one \u2018try\u2019 from the player. The player cannot continue if there is no \u2018try\u2019 left. Once everyone is at \u2018home\u2019, the level is won. Switches/doors/teleports are found throughout the game that has a specific color that can only be used by the correct colored homie. There are also traps and enemies throughout the level that can hurt the homies. The \u2018Try Again\u2019 screen will show up if one of the homie dies. The player must utilize the four homies in order to get them home. The player can only control one homy and can cycle through which homy to control.</p><p>Whenever a homie is hit, the homie becomes invulnerable for a few seconds. This way the player can move the homie out of harm\u2019s way. The portrait also changes whenever the homy is hit.</p><p>The player can collect items from the level by moving the selected homie over it. The item will be activated by the selected homie.</p><p>An enemy will respawn in time after they get killed.</p><p>If the player wins the level, the time remaining is added to the player\u2019s score.</p><p>Controls</p><ul><li>Left/Right\u00a0Arrow Key -\u00a0Moves currently selected homy left or right.<br/>When paused, used to scroll around the map.<br/></li><li>Up/Down\u00a0Arrow Key -\u00a0Use for climbing a ladder.\u00a0When paused, used to scroll around the map.<br/></li><li>Z -\u00a0Use Skill.</li><li>Down\u00a0Arrow Key -\u00a0Activate switches/teleportation/etc.<br/></li><li>X -\u00a0Selects next homy to control.</li><li>Space -\u00a0Pause, player can choose to view the level or restart the level.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/0927e3f236c711faccbc508f1d94adfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Dionisio"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
