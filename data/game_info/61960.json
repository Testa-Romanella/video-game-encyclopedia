It was Atohi\u2019s watch up in the church\u2019s second tower. <br/><br/>He\u2019d been up there for at least two hours, watching for signs of life. There was nothing, no movement except the falling snow; the same as always.<br/><br/>Sweeping the distant snowfield, Atohi scanned back over the same spot, brows furrowed. <br/>\u201cSomething\u2019s different\u201d, he muttered quietly.  Zooming in, he could just make out large footprints in the crisp snow.  <br/><br/>He followed them with the binoculars, pausing and scanning back as his gaze swept over a flash of red. There, standing several miles away stood the man in the old red coat, watching him.<br/>Atohi reeled in shock, the binoculars tumbling from his hand, stumbling back.  Fear filled his mind, overwhelming him as the world turned black, and he collapsed to the stone floor.<br/><br/>Since the snow started falling, many have entered the church high in the mountains seeking refuge.  Many have tried to leave, to take their chances in the snow outside.
