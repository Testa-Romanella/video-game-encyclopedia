Contains simulators with twists like double tribal councils, swaps, EOE, Redemption Island, and Outcasts. There's even a simulator with a swap every episode! You can use a version with either regular or cinematic tribal councils. There's no in-depth logic or advantages yet but those features will be added later on</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>-Not for mobile</p><p>Github link:https://github.com/nickyDaggs/ndaggs-RealityShowCustomSimulators</p>\n<p>Check out the Brantsteele sims too:https://brantsteele.com/index.php</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T03:03:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AppelIsCool"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
