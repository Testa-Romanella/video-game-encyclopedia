{"id": 94966, "slug": "shadowbright", "name": "Shadowbright", "name_original": "Shadowbright", "description": "<p>An experimental puzzle platformer game where structures\u00a0are only solid when illuminated. I hope you find the puzzles innovative, challenging, and entertaining.</p><p>UPDATE.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I went in and fixed up the controls, switching the jump button to space and using up (or down, or ctrl) for interacting with items. Now it's difficult for me, since I'm used to jumping with up, but more sensible for ... everyone else, it makes wall-jumping much easier. I haven't yet fixed how input handling is wonky and occasionally misses a press,\u00a0sorry about that! I hope it doesn't mess anyone up in too frustrating a situation.\u00a0I'm working on it. :)</p>\n<p>Even more important is <strong>there is music now</strong>! (<em>It might take a minute to load while you start playing)\u00a0</em>The amazing Zach Heyde took it upon himself to compose original background music! <em>You can mute it with m</em><em>,</em>\u00a0but why would you? It's really phenomenal. If you need music for your projects, you should check Zach out. Commission\u00a0him for everything! You can find\u00a0the OST here:\u00a0https://zachheyde.bandcamp.com/track/shadowbright-ost</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>Use the LEFT/RIGHT or A/D to move, SPACE to jump, and UP, DOWN, W, or S to pick up/drop items and switch switches. You can also use a gamepad. Your objective is to get the character to the dotted rectangular goal for each level. The music can be muted with M.</em></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>I'm proud of this little game\u00a0and I want to show it off, and get feedback. Is it done? Nope. There's so much I want to improve! But it never will be 'done'. I've moved on to other things, and I am happy with what's here.\u00a0I believe the core ideas are interesting and inspiring, and the execution at is least competent. This little game was fun to make and I\u00a0hope you enjoy it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a96fe2a969b2dcba34cd423ac68b4678.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hunter Dyar"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
