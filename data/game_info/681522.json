It began as a small passion project as a means to bring myself out of a slump in my life, and it graduated into something far more ambitious than I intended. It's been a long road, and although I hope to keep my next adventure a lot shorter, I feel everything I've learned made it time well spent. I hope you enjoy my creation, I look forward to sharing my worlds with you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T03:51:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6bb79fdff92b5a9ee69bb8d4a188bc.jpg", "website": "https://www.zentientgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zentient Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zentient Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
