In RIMSHOT you fly your spaceship around the edge of a black-hole where giant alien kaiju are entering our universe. Can you save our universe from the terrors of the unknown?</p>\n<p>The jam had a focus of \"BOSS\" and a theme\u00a0 of \"ON THE EDGE.\"</p>\n<p>To implement the focus, we made a boss rush game. To implement the theme, we used 2 methods. 1. Your ship is tethered the edge of a black-hole. 2. The closer to the edge of destruction that your ship is, the more bullets the ship fires, and at a faster rate of fire\u00a0as well.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY - There are instruction in game if you don't want to continue readying.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS - use A &amp; D or Left and Right Arrow keys to move around the edge of the black-hole. Use Spacebar to shoot the ships cannons, you can hold it down.</p>\n<p>GAME-PLAY = There are 3 bosses of increasing difficulty. After defeating a boss, you can choose a power-up to assist you in the next battle. Use it wisely, and you only get to use it once.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was made by clonethirteen and Spacespy. You can find links to our pages below. To make the game we used Construct 3, Aseprite, FL Studio, Splice, Jsfxr.</p>\n\n<p>https://clonethirteen.itch.io/\u00a0 \u00a0https://twitter.com/_clonethirteen</p>\n<p>https://spacespy64.itch.io/\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://twitter.com/spacespy_tv</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33bc6f39058bd82c771e31ebb1647ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen", "Spacespy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
