It is not the dream game that was once thought, but it is the result of excellence (not excellent). The objective of making this video game after so many years is mostly an experiment and first learning step for future projects more focused on history than gameplay.<br/>Thanks to my dear friend Matias Santucho for the realization of the vast majority of video game designs and for his support in waiting patiently for these long years haha<br/><br/>Greetings Federico</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20ed84388f2ab21e70c49bba64e97710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Snorlax95"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
