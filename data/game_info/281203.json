What awaits you at the end is unclear, but you hope to find an answer to how things have come to how they are.<br/><br/>This is my first successful group project and with the help of my friends, we finished development in four weeks. Originally, this was a class project before a few modifications were made to be public ready. I would like to continue game development as a hobby, although this is my first successful publication too. Otherwise, I\u00a0expect to continue working with computers as I pursue my degree in Biochemistry. I hope you enjoy playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75d7b63b5522e5621a4613ce14f47615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Illinoire"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
