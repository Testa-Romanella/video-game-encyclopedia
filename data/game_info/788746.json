But when the demons got mad due to Sonic\u2019s recent victory in the dark realm, they wanted revenge against Sonic. So, the battle isn't over, yet! Help Sonic survive as he dashes through the <strong>Gates of Heaven</strong> and other dimensions into a dangerous journey to save earthling life forms and spiritual souls from demons' maniacal demands that could ruin the entire universe.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This is a <strong>protesting</strong> project due to so many hellish games on the internet that talk or support hell.
