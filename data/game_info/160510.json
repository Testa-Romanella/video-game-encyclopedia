I really wanted to enter, since it is my first game jam, but good god. I over scheduled during the event which resulted in little time for the jam itself. While I'm not too happy with the game itself, I learned a lot about how to manage my time/have realistic expectations for a game jam.</p>\n<p>-your boy (god this game sucks)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/386/386509726c490652d9b0a976aacbef67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RickyDiculous"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
