It's my second game so far so I'm proud of the different things I was able to implement for this.  It was a great learning experience even if I was not able to add all the features I wanted by the deadline. Feel free to play and give any feedback or comment. The game is not very long and there may be some bugs here and there. <br/></p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Shop Theme by Cleyton Kauffman - http://opengameart.org/users/doppelganger</p>\n<p>Running Water by Arthur - https://opengameart.org/content/running-water<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c7300e0ec5fd7b7af0fac7d52298443c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tadpolily"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
