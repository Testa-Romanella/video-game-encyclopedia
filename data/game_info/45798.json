The only issue is that to get there, you have to get through the Labyrinth. The game is intended to be a fairly calm and relaxing game. There are no enemies, there are no traps, and aside from the maze itself, there are no puzzles. Simply walk through the corridors until you find the candle, then drop to the next level. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimple in concept, but potentially very complicated. Can you get to the end and enter the light?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10aefa864eeeeb00cace85cede15812e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benjamin Scott"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lack of Luck Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
