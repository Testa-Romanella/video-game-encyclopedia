Go wild running the most fun and beautiful zoo you can imagine. Care for unpredictable and untamed animals (and those are just the guests!). Plan wisely, because if the animals don&#39;t like their food, environment, or handling, they interact poorly with visitors, and unhappy guests means fewer dollars. Play smart and keep everyone and everything happy, and you&#39;ll be a zoo tycoon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1422e6852cc5018df504de4045551b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Fang Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
