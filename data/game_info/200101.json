{"id": 200101, "slug": "super-dig-man", "name": "Super Dig Man", "name_original": "Super Dig Man", "description": "<p>This is a prototype I built in early 2017, the purpose is to dig up ores (<strong>press SPACE to dig the tile in front of you</strong>), upgrade your character and explore an island.</p>\n<p>Digging up ores takes multiple hits, which allows you to decide early if you want to keep digging the tile (if its a low-level ore, you'll get to a point where you don't want it).</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>O\u00a0</strong>to open the buy screen. Convert your ores down each level (Adetite &gt; Gold &gt; Silver &gt; Copper\u00a0&gt; Relic) and use relics to repair your shovel and upgrade your digging ability).</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on your shovel durability at the top left to make sure you have enough ore/relics to buy a repair!</p>\n<p>If you enjoy this concept please leave a comment or consider supporting me through a purchase. If this has enough potential I\u00a0would love to expand it to a full game with many more features.</p><p><strong>Note<br/></strong>This prototype doesn't have saving built in.<br/>If you run out of durability and can't buy a repair, you need to re-open the game.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><ul><li><strong>WASD/Arrow Keys\u00a0</strong>- Move</li><li><strong>SPACE -\u00a0</strong>Dig</li><li><strong>O\u00a0</strong>- Open buy menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753adcdaed6cab7a8cf260253e16f272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arcadiaxdev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
