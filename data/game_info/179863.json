The original Rockball was the last game I\u00a0made, and due to it's \"quality\" I\u00a0ended up taking it down, along with my other projects. Years later, my motivation and time have allowed me to work on my passion once again. I\u00a0decided to work on a simple project in order to get me back into the swing of development, and an idea instantly sprung... Rockball 2. My goal was to improve on the original from both a visual and technical perspective.</p>\n<p>Rockball 2 is a simple 3D\u00a0platformer, where the goal is to roll, jump, and maneuver through each level. As mentioned, this game sets to improve on the original in every way. Rockball 2 includes:</p>\n<ul><li>10 Levels, each with it's own visual theme, and many have a unique gameplay element introduced to them!</li><li>A Full Soundtrack!</li><li>Gamepad Support (Limited)!</li></ul>\n<p>Although I\u00a0don't really enjoy the original Rockball enough for me to make it it's own page, I\u00a0will include an optional download for it for anyone who wants to give it a try (mainly to compare it to the superior Rockball 2).</p>\n<p>UPDATE 1.1 CHANGELOG</p>\n<ul><li>Added new 3d models, provided by @SmallTalkSock on Twitter!</li></ul>\n<p>UPDATE 1.1.1 CHANGELOG</p>\n<ul><li>Slightly adjusted the title screen (More spinners!)</li><li>Game window can now be resized while in window mode</li><li>Added normal and height maps to the Rockball texture</li><li>Adjusted Level 5. Added more platforms to make the level slightly easier</li><li>Optimized that damn water in Level 7</li><li>Adjusted Level 9. Added more paths to make it more maze-like</li><li>Changed Linux executable type to Universal</li><li>Added Level 0</li></ul><p>UPDATE 1.2 CHANGELOG</p><ul><li>HELL MODE - Play the original 10 levels of Rockball 2, but insanely difficult!</li><li>Added a new menu for selecting your Level Set, and made it simple to add more in the future (just in case...)</li><li>Completely reworked Level 6 (and added Hell Mode variant)</li></ul>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you guys enjoy this project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc395ba96a0f3b20e1b805f36822942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheDeadlyCherry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
