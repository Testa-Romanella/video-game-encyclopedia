This is a very short demo showcasing the platformer side of what my final game would be like. This is being shown to gather ideas and tweaks that can be made by popular vote.</p>\n<p>The story of the final game is as follows:</p>\n<p>This is Boxbot, Boxbot is a small robot made by a professor of High acclaim. The professor had been falsely accused of creating a mass robot army to take over a city so it is your job to find who is responsible and to turn him over.</p>\n<p>You will face many obstacles in your path; from there being police that you must avoid for you not wanting to harm a human being and robots of which you will gladly takedown. The final game faces you with the abilities that are shown in the images.</p>\n<p>This demo is a short game, and that is why you have a time trial to beat it as fast as possible, the final game may use the time-based aspect as a method of gaining points similar to how classic platformers work.</p>\n<p>Please if you can, send me some comments about this game idea as it has been a passion project in the making for over two years and now that I have almost completed my college diploma in games development, I can continue working on these games full time with your support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T05:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc6fd21feec6baff37a03499c89075f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neatly Packaged Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
