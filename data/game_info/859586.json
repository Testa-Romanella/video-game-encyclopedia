Your goal is to run the shop\u00a0successfully by trading with clients that come in. Each trader will offer you several trades that are all worth your money, but unfortunately for you, you can *only pick one!* And if you refuse the trade, your bad luck may catch up to you as the traders become more and more aggressive!</p>\n<p>Traders also love gambling, and if a particular trade looks appealing to you, you can gamble on it to make it better or worse, but again, you can only *pick one* trade to gamble on.</p>\n<p>To keep the shop running, you must also fulfill the king's orders. If you don't pay the King what he wants, your brother's shop may be in jeopardy. The King does offer you some choices on what to give him, but again, you must *just pick one!*</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Interact - Left Click</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programmers</p>\n<p>Kristian Kolehmainen - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Imated - Game and Design Programmer</p>\n<p>Robert Kilkenny - Assistant Programmer</p>\n<p>Alexander Dvorak - Overflow Programmer</p>\n<p>Artists</p>\n<p>Vanessa \"Tsunamie\" Palisoc - Character, Card, and UI Sprite Artists</p>\n<p>Bryan Morris - Character Sprite and UI Artist</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Gray - Game and Character Sprite Artist</p>\n<p>Brandon Teta - Lead Environment\u00a0Artist</p>\n<p>Gaby - Concept and Lead Character Art Director</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f27246f18951b30e7f42bb583f3dda7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MCKoleman", "Terra42", "Imated", "Spide6667", "BMorrisArt", "Studio Koleman", "Tsunamie602", "GabyM", "DarkflameX9", "Elizabeth-A-Gray"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
