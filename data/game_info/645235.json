I'm new to game development this is my first game.\u00a0This is a small 2D platformer where you play as a box trying to reach the door at the end of the level. This is the first game I have made (I have made one other game as a team for a game jam but this is my first game I've made which I made alone) I hope you all enjoy, for my next game I will be working on a small top down game which will have some combat and exploration features and all the art will be done by me (I have no idea how long this will take but it hopefully will help me create even better games while i still learn the basics of game design).\u00a0 I hope you enjoy my first game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T05:59:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f40a25126e3781555c766f9e54e018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bradleydoesgame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
