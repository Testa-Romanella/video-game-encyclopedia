{"id": 243169, "slug": "odyssey-the-story-of-science", "name": "Odyssey - The Story of Science", "name_original": "Odyssey - The Story of Science", "description": "Odyssey is a unique science adventure game where you need to navigate across a group of islands in search of a 13-year old girl Kai and her family trapped and waiting to be rescued. The game has an explicit purpose of teaching astronomy and mechanics from the ancient Greeks to Galileo. It does so by taking the player through an intellectual journey as the player is physically navigating through the islands. Gaming is seamlessly integrated with a historical approach to science and storytelling, through Kai's in-game journal from which the player learns the story and the science content, which are needed to solve the puzzles. Players can expect a significant amount of reading. The game is aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards and is ideal for middle school and high school students and for adults who like to read about science.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/769/769348fde80ebf797d67ce555cec811b.jpg", "website": "http://theodysseygame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Young Socratics"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Young Socratics"], "esrb_rating": null}
