Keeping part of their charm through mechanics and visuals, as well as bring more modern design and visuals to this genre.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The player plays through a linear level set in a fantasy style. They will use a melee combat system that, just like the classic games, is restricted to only looking left and right, but the combat itself will draw upon more modern games where they can attack, block and parry enemies, resulting in the combat being more skilful and engaging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As stated before, the game is set in a fantasy setting, so a lot of environments is dungeons, towns and churches. Aiming for a classic feel with the environments and so the levels will be made of blocky geometry with pixel art sprite work applied to them, then with a post-processing effect on top to pixelize the screen. Also using some more modern features to help add a bit more visual flair like modern lighting systems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developed by Michael Rose</p>\n<p>Audio by 'Evil Mind', from 'Super Retro Audio Bundle'</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T04:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec6547b51c9758add6e48b31e3528e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Rose"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
