You've noticed that fat cats are quite popular on the internet, so you've decided to put on some weight.<br/></p>\n<p>Each day fill your schedule with up to 4 activities (planned more, no time :( ).</p>\n<p>Each activity is a little minigame. Your chonk gain per minigame is your food gain - energy used. If you gain enough chonk, you level up and gain weight.</p>\n<p>The minigames get harder as you level up. Try to reach level 8 and win the game.</p>\n<p>I will release a post-jam version at some point with fixes and more activities.</p>\n<p>I know that the music jumps and it's annoying, sorry.</p>\n<p>Some of the sound effects were shamelessly stolen from Scratch lol.
