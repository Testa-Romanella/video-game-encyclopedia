Now in her early twenties, she\u2019s abandoned that dream to focus on her uninspiring job as a computer repair technician. There\u2019s not enough time in the day to focus on game development \u2013 and anyway, isn\u2019t she too old to entertain such unrealistic notions?<br/><br/>That is, until her childhood friend, Clover, introduces her to the seductive Suki.<br/><br/>Suki is determined to turn Nekohime\u2019s dream into a reality and finally develop a game \u2013 and she refuses to let Nekohime\u2019s self-doubt stop her. Whether she wants to or not, Nekohime\u2019s pulled into a brand new world, alongside these two bubbly, optimistic girls.<br/><br/>Will they be able to make a hit game together, or will it all be for nought? And, in the end, will Nekohime manage to find true love?<br/><br/><br/>The unwilling heroine of the story. Her real name is \u2018Sayo\u2019, but her friends refer to her by her internet handle - much to her embarrassment.<br/><br/>Though she dislikes being referred to by a silly nickname she made up on the spot when she was a kid, she exhibits a lot of catlike traits. She\u2019s always seen in her cat-eared jacket, she likes taking naps, and she can be rather \u2018catty\u2019.<br/><br/>She lacks purpose in life, and is bored by her tedious, unrewarding job. Maybe making a video game is exactly the kind of diversion she needs.<br/><br/><br/>One of Nekohime\u2019s closest friends. Her real name is Chika.<br/><br/>Though she loves revealing cosplay and dressing in tightly-fitting spandex, she\u2019s actually an elementary school teacher. She\u2019s warm, cheerful, bubbly, and loves playing around with finger paints, which makes her a surprisingly good fit for her job (and no, she doesn\u2019t dress quite so outlandishly when she\u2019s at work).<br/><br/>Being creative, she enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and composing music. She nominates herself as the composer for her video game venture.<br/><br/><br/>A mischievous, vixen-like girl from Nekohime\u2019s past, infamous for encouraging her elderly grandmother to feed her laptop\u2019s D-Drive rice for a \u2018Shinto purification ceremony\u2019.<br/><br/>Suki flirts with almost everyone, to such an extent it\u2019s hard to tell whether she really means it. She also enjoys teasing people \u2013 particularly uptight people like Nekohime who get flustered easily.<br/>She grew up in a shrine, but is worlds apart from the image of a \u2018traditional Japanese beauty\u2019. She can be loud and obnoxious and incredibly pushy, but she\u2019ll apologize when she realizes she\u2019s gone too far.<br/>She\u2019s also a competent digital artist, who spent a large portion of her life drawing and uploading her pictures online. After all, there\u2019s not much else to do at a shrine.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>small choices affect the ending, three endings are available in total<br/></li><li>play the game in Chinese, just change the language in the options <br/></li><li>this visual novel contains fanservice</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f1c5aa6712f9976a363262ae246bdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 197, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
