He has been in the business for as long as time itself, with his \u201caccidental\u201d manifestation into our world, and has been bloodthirsty since. Wielding a custom-build Barrett M4G1C sniper rifle, his services are available for the small price of some lucky charms and LSD, which is used to manufacture the magic-infused bullets. The hunt has started, and if you are marked, 10 seconds is all it takes....</p>\r\nGameplay:   \r\n<p>Using Mr. Bubbles\u2019 magic-infused bullets and time slowing powers, you will weave bullets through impossible angles to take out assigned targets. However, the magical connection is lost after 10 seconds, so put your powers to good use!\r\n</p>\n\r\nDISCLAIMER!\r\n<p>The audio in MIA may be completely out-of-wack due to...you know....reasons.
