Do you desire golf holes that feature intense cerebral challenges rather than challenges of physical execution? Then Escargolf has you covered! By replacing the ball from \"traditional\" golf with a snail, we have slowed the action to a crawl, allowing the game to be appreciated at a scale never seen before. Of course, we would never condone the use of a barbaric weapon such as a golf club on a snail, so our snails have been specially trained to launch themselves in golf ball-like trajectories at your command. So what are you waiting for? Download Escargolf today!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEscargolf was developed as part of \r\n\tTOJam 12: What Twelves Below, which was a game jam held in Toronto, Ontario on May 5-7, 2017. The theme of the jam was Prepare for Disappointment, so do be prepared for that I guess. There were many other really awesome games made at that jam, most of which can be found here.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t As always, we would love to hear your criticisms and feedback - hit us up at \r\n\t@theangrysquids on Twitter or email us at angrysquidgames (at) gmail.com.\r\n</p>Credits<p>\r\n\tBritney Coates (@britney_coates): Art &amp; Visual Design\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMax Manco (@max_manco): Level &amp; Game Design\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMike Romaniak (@mikeromaniak): Sound &amp; Audio Design\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCraig Thomas (@craigrthomas): Programming\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8de8fddeef5253a67acf5aad291783ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngrySquidGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
