So why don\u2019t buy fonts? Is it worth it to spent multiple hours on one font if you can also buy them for only one dollar?</p>\n<p>I made these fonts for my previous game, but since I do not need them anymore. it would be a shame to do nothing with them. That is why I'm selling them to everyone who wants to save themselves the time and effort.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>License</strong><br/></p>\n<p>These fonts are licenced under creative commons:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Information</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- compatible with smaller resolution games.<br/>- available for commercial use<br/>- saves you time<br/>- cheap<br/>- different sizes</p>\n<p><strong>Social media</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Instagram</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Youtube</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Contact and support</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>If you happen to come across some problems or have questions, comments, feedback, or anything else to say you can email me:\r\nEMAIL: monkopusgames@gmail.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:55:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f28f2a93ae81ba8c4cc5f97d003ff96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["monkopus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
