You can place walls, boxes (that lava can pass through but players cannot), time powerups (that freeze the lava in place and make you invincible for 2 seconds) and coins.</p>\n<p>There are 8 premade levels available for download at any point by hitting \"D\" whilst in the menu.</p>\n<p>You'll need Love2Dinstalled to play.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8b0263e0e9437e0cbe38063c900541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Pebsie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
