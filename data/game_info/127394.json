You have to help a monster to scare a teenager by finding out what scares her. The game has multiple endings and is very short. So try out different things.</p><p>The game plays in only one scene. A description of the controls can be found in the game. The controls are mouse only. Languages available: English and German.<br/></p><p>The game originally came to life during Ludum Dare 33 (Theme: You are the Monster). A few month later I decided to rework and polish the game to have a first small but finished game released. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.
