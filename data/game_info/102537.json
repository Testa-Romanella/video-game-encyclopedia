The Oculus Rift + Touch controllers may work... but I have not tested them. CLEAR YOUR ENTIRE SPACE to play this!</p><p>Each puzzle is one room, but you can't simply walk through it. Instead, you change your position within your own physical room, and teleport into adjacent areas, retaining your relative position. This sounds more complicated than it is, so just play!</p><p>This game relies HEAVILY on roomscale. The game SHOULD scale to your playspace, and should be possible to beat with the minimum space requirements (2 x 1.5 meters) but I'd really recommend at least 2x2 or bigger.</p><p>The game will tell you the controls, but just in case:</p><p>Point your right hand controller towards an adjacent area and lightly TOUCH the touchpad to see a preview of where you will be in that room.</p><p>PRESS the touchpad to teleport into that area. </p><p>Don't forget to actually MOVE AROUND in your physical playspace.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bd0a400083c99b1e518e14ae5519447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thesambassador"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
