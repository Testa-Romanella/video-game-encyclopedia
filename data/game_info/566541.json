Gun, solving puzzles, and discovering the Periodic Table of the Elements in the process.<br/><br/>Our idea is for the player to be at the epicenter of the danger. All of the places where you can't look with your own eyes, shouldn't stick your hands, shouldn't approach with your body - that's where we want to put the player. <br/><br/>The tests performed by nuclear physicists involve fantastically large devices, employing immense forces on small targets. Many are designed like a racetrack to begin with, why not? We want to put the player in the middle of the experiments. Not necessarily drawn to scale, but drawn to the interaction.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5ea2697dc89c1277d951a9ee968471.jpg", "website": "http://monumentalartseng.com/cyclotronica/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Randy Lee Blain", "Jason Blain"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Monumental Arts Engineering"], "esrb_rating": null}
