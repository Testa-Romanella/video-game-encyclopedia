My name is Sabrina and I am currently a Media Design School student studying Game Art. \u00a0I hope to produce small games in my own time and work in a company like Riot Games in the future. I am passionate about art, black cats and anything Victorian or nature themed. I also have a love of trees and birds with owls being one of my favourite. In my spare time, you can find me walking in a park and admiring the flowers or busy sketching in my sketch book.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acdb746546718d6badd01decc0fea42a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SilentReverie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
