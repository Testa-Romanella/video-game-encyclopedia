{"id": 109147, "slug": "wordup", "name": "WordUp", "name_original": "WordUp", "description": "<p>In <strong>WordUp</strong> your aim is to grow a word more than the computer can. The computer places a letter. Then it's your turn. If the computer can't continue the word on its turn, you win and get a point for every letter placed. If you choose a letter that creates a word not in the ENABLE word list, you lose and start again with zero points. That's it.</p><p><em>I've rated the game for mature audiences because the word list contains offensive words and could be chosen by the player or the computer. Future versions might well change this.</em></p><p>The game prototype for the Mac and PC uses:</p><ul><li>Messy, quick and dirty C++ code, the game written from scratch starting for Ludum Dare (growing theme) solo in under 48 hours</li><li>The ENABLE word list</li><li>The Cinder Library</li><li>The Apple San Francisco system font</li><li>Tile graphics created in Acorn</li><li>Sound effects created in BFXR</li></ul><p>I plan to continue developing this prototype into a full game. This is the first playable, original game I've created since 1988</p><p><em><strong>Update </strong>December 27, 2015: PC port added. Unzip and run. No difference from the Mac version. 32-bit. Windows 8.1 and up, it crashes for some people, so please hang fire until the 28th so that I can investigate!</em></p><p><em><strong>Update </strong>December 28, 2015: PC build updated. Unzip and run. This is a release version instead of yesterday's faulty debug version that didn't work for some people.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update </strong>December 29, 2015: PC build updated. This version has updated assets using ogg files for audio and a ttf file for the font. This works on more PCs.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffd68ff7f3b9d9ca585eb1a5bf4e7a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shahidkamal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
