There are no in-app purchases, no ads, or anything else to get between you and some classic side-scroller racing action that honors nostalgic memories of notoriously difficult games from our collective past. You'll need fast reflexes and nerves of steel, but if you clear enough obstacles, you might see the ending screen and learn how the story ends! Or keep playing to see how many obstacles you can clear for the bragging rights.<br/><br/>\u2022 Classic retro racing action!<br/>\u2022 Old school game design, bright modern art style<br/>\u2022 3 distinct zones, each with different obstacles<br/>\u2022 Endless scroller that intensifies the further you get!<br/>\u2022 No in-app purchases or ads, just you and the action<br/>\u2022 Clear enough obstacles to learn how the story ends!<br/>\u2022 90s style indie rock soundtrack<br/>\u2022 Keep playing for the \"most obstacles cleared\" bragging rights<br/>\u2022 Controls easy to learn, difficult to master<br/>\u2022 Easter eggs for fans of classic retro video games!<br/><br/>Race in three different zones with different traps and obstacles as you get closer to Center City. Move up and down to avoid obstacles, and jump over gaps and electric fences. Watch out for the authorities who can shoot lightning out of their cruisers! Be careful around fluid spills, they will cause your speeder to slip and lose control for a moment.<br/><br/>This is twitchy, sweaty-palmed classic arcade action but with a bright modern art style. The controls are simple to use, but mastery takes time: move up by pressing on the top half of the display near the left or right edge. Move down by pressing on the bottom half of the display near the left or right edge. The longer you press on these areas, the faster your speeder will move in that direction. Jump by pressing anywhere else on the screen. You get three lives, so make them count!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T10:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce0cdc71638abc47ad1ef159adb0918_JokWbsh.jpg", "website": "https://sterling-interactive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sterling Interactive"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sterling Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
