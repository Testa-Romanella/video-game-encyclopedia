This is my first game where I decided to make a sequel due to the success of the previous. 3D Platformer II was designed to be easily understandable from an artist point of view so I can expand my game development because creating a sequel game will help me gain a greater understanding because games have always made sequels and have always tried to do better than the previous game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3D Platformer II uses game elements like Level select world, collectables, interactive menu, health system, a boss battle, state-based enemy AI and animating characters. I program the game on C# and developed transferrable and strong problem-solving skills. I had to download a new version of Unity where I learned the new capabilities of 3D development in Unity which helped me learn more about game development.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0W (Move Up), A (Move Left), S (Move Down), D (Move Right), Spacebar (Jump)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da13a3a6a13988bd4699329600d2ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
