You love your flower pots out in the sun. But it\u2019s hot. Like\u00a0<strong>REALLY hot</strong>. So you have to constantly\u00a0<strong>water your plants</strong>\u00a0so they don\u2019t die. You gain points by\u00a0<strong>keeping your plants alive</strong>\u00a0and lose points by letting them die (not taking into account the emotional damage of seeing your plant buddies\u00a0<strong>WILT IN THE SUN</strong>). Make sure to\u00a0<strong>refill</strong>\u00a0your watering can often so you\u00a0<strong>don\u2019t run out of water.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer Mode</strong>: (This mode is REALLY the most fun / heart of the game. It can even get quite tactical, but PLEASE don't let it end like the average game of \"Mario Party\"...)</p>\n<p>Plants belong to the person who last watered it. This means they grant points to this player while alive, but also deduce points when dying. Try to score the most points by shoving and keeping the other player from watering and keeping your own plants alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Player 1:</p>\n<ul><li>w, a, s, d / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement</li><li>space / a-button : Spill water from your watering can</li><li>left shift / b-button: shove the other player</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2:</p>\n<ul><li>up,down,left,right / D-Pad / Left-Stick : Directional movement</li><li>right shift / a-button : Spill water from your watering can</li><li>keypad 0 / b-button: shove the other player</li></ul>\n<p>Select stages by clicking on them. Return to menu by pressing Escape. Gamepad support is through SDL2. All major gamepads like 360 should work. My crappy age\u00a0old ps1 ripoff controllers worked :-D .</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made with my very own handcrafted 2D Game Engine, called the RawSalmonEngine. The Web Build is brand new and should work now somewhat reliably. I didn\u2019t know that even gamepads work with browser nowadays. That\u2019s what I call magic.</p>\n<p>I made all the pixel art with\u00a0Krita. All sound effects are made with my mouth, recorded and cut with\u00a0Audacity. The music was done with the awesome\u00a0LMMS\u00a0using only its gameboy sound. The map was built wit the\u00a0Tiled Map Editor\u00a0and my IDE of choice is\u00a0Code::Blocks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d895544b7eb5a5d8f469010a0da54dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["VectorWolf"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
