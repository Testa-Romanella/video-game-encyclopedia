Run, jump, and avoid forks of death, scorching\u00a0stoves, and other deadly kitchen devices as you battle against friends and family. All the while collecting butter to slide and boost you forwards, peanut butter whirlpools to suck in your competitors, and other culinary items to boost your toast or sabotage other bread.<br/></p>\n\n\n<strong>The Characters</strong>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0Louie Loaf -\u00a0</strong>Louis lives to be toasted.
