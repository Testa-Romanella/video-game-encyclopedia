Run around the map to collect the pills as the ground disappears wherever you step.</p>\n<p>When you inevitably fall to the lower level, all the ground will disappear except what you have already walked on above.\u00a0However, any extra pills you collect here will double your score! The better you do, the higher you can multiply your score at the lower level. Karma!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>All assets in the game were created by me using Pixlr and Vectr except for the following:</p>\n<p>- First person controller taken from Unity Standard Assets</p>\n<p>- Skybox Addon by Eclypso</p>\n<p>- Soundfx:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Highway Freedom Loop by DDmyzik</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - WarpDrive_01.wav by LittleRobotSoundFactory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:50:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5faeb35cdead5f4c0a8bb9ca8e9fd7af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Allerises"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
