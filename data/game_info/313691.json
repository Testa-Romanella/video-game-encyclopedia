Our team name was \"Almost Awesome\". The game was meant to be played with a controller. Any dual shock controller will work. I added keyboard support just for the in browser build.\u00a0 It was everyone's favorite among all the other teams. I was inspired by making a cross between Mario and Darksouls. Play it in full screen mode. Enjoy the game.</li><li>The game does work with controllers in browser, including up to 4 players. So go grab your buddy and play!</li><li>Please Post screenshots making it to the end of the levels! its super exciting. through thorough play testing it has been proven all 3 levels can be beat.\u00a0</li><li>let me know your thoughts in the comments below</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef8dcd4f0e5a8dbe8fc978198905b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kurtisnienhuis"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
