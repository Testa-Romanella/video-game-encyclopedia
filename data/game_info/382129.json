I have been working on some 2D games with unity and this may be the first 3D project for me. It was quite hard and I could not do anything in first 2 days (I was trying to understand 3D physics and colliders). I am happy with the final product with such a low time.</p>\n<p>I started my game design as creating my world and gameplay elements from nothingness. First idea was that, every step player took in game will change game world and environment. I dumped that idea almost fully because of lack of models. Final game is a combination of gone home and to the moon. I took mechanics and ideas from both games and implemented as much as I could. You need to explore world and listen story of an architect. Through optaining some memory pieces, player can unlock light sources to progress through game. There is not much mechanic when we think core game mechanics and there is only one simple puzzle. I hope you can enjoy and bare lots of bug.</p>\n<p>Be aware remaining part is spoiler:<br/>Actually what I tried to do with story is that, this architect is fine at first glance. Everything seems normal and just a little bit sad. But after each progress, mental statue of this architect became much worse. So, I implemented start with nothing as architect starts with no disease but develops some. I think with proper story writing and good object sets, this idea can work as a full game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:55:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c585048d98015167bb7db263ffe14de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["despdair"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
