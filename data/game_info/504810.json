Time is now on a never-ending loop of the same 24-hour period with the giant monster destroying the city. When the loop resets, the city resets and the monster starts the whole process again. But the city\u2019s residents remember what happened each loop, so they start to get smarter in fighting the monster. Players control the monster as they try to destroy as much of the city within the 24-hour period. After each loop, the number of enemies increases. The game ends when the player is destroyed by the enemies. The object of the game is to see how many loops the player can successfully destroy the city and survive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>John Gale - Lead Designer/Programmer</p>\n<p>Javin Stone - Art (Character)</p>\n<p>Ryan Willard - Music</p>\n<p>Created for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam October 2-5,\u00a02020</p>\n<p>Theme:\u00a0Stuck\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0Loop</p>\n<p>Made\u00a0with\u00a0RPG\u00a0Maker\u00a0MV</p>\n<p>Uses the MV Map Projectiles plugin by Galv</p>\n<p>Uses the YSP Preloader by Dr. Yami<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:35:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/12095e239344ecdd4751f24ad2e85d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Johnsensei"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
