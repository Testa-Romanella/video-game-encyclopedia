Click the <strong>Check</strong> button (or type <strong>c</strong>) to hear the current arrangement of measures. When it matches the original, the puzzle is solved and the song selection menu will be displayed. \r\n</p>\n<p>To restore the song, click on any measure to select it. Clicking on it again will play that measure in isolation. While selected, you can make changes to correct the music: <br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Click on a different measure to swap their positions.</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Order</strong> button (or type <strong>o</strong>), to change the order of the notes.\r\n</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Pitch</strong> button (or type <strong>i</strong>), to change the pitch of the notes.\r\n</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Length</strong> button (or type <strong>l</strong>), to change the duration of the notes\r\n</li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Key</strong> button (or type <strong>k</strong>), to change the key between major and minor.</li></ul>\n<p>(Only the options used in creation of the puzzle will be available.) </p>\n\n<p>When you select a puzzle, song's difficulty level will set the possible puzzle elements automatically. These can be changed to make the puzzle easier or harder. Puzzle elements can be <strong>Always</strong> applied, <strong>Never</strong> applied, or applied at <strong>Random</strong>. (<strong>Count</strong> of the <strong>Random</strong> elements will be chosen for the puzzle.) For an additional challenge, <strong>Blind</strong> mode will hide the notes of each measure and <strong>Deaf</strong> mode will not allow listening to individual measures, only the complete piece. \r\n</p>\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n<p>\r\nThe original music is from COVER Corp. and associated talents; available under a permissive policy for fan works.
