Defeat them by matching your own color with theirs and absorb them!\r\n\r\nSome Context\r\nThis is my first solo game in Unity, and since\u00a0it slipped my mind the GMTK Game Jam was this weekend,\u00a0I hadn't prepared at all. I was lucky I had notifications on for the YT as I saw the theme get announced.\u00a0\r\nThe connection with the theme might be a slight stretch but my thought process ended up with me thinking of \"joining colors\" as everything else I came up with was way too complicated for me to attempt.\r\nMost of my time making the game\u00a0was spent learning how to code in C# as I already had some experience with using Unity. As a result,\u00a0I didn't get everything I wanted in (like cool animations) but the gameplay idea is there. Hope you enjoy!\r\nI got the sound from this\u00a0asset pack.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:53:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a3/2a3fa4989e1ced3b42f008ebdc62c908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TaLcGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
