Now it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s back in style.\r\nWith updated features, graphics and sound effects. There are now 3 game modes\r\nto experience and enjoy through a multistage campaign.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Classic\r\n\u2013\u00a0</strong>Just\r\nwant the classic Pong experience with updated ascetics then this game mode will\r\ngive you that.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for\r\nsomething a bit different then try out the other 2 game modes inside of Retro\r\nRemix.</p>\n<p><strong>Defender\r\n\u2013\u00a0</strong>Puts\r\na small spin on the classic Pong experience by having shields that are placed\r\nin the field of play. These shields can be turned to your colour doing so will\r\nmake the ball deflect back at the opponent if they hit it with one of their\r\nshots.</p>\n<p><strong>Domination</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Is the biggest departure\r\nfrom the classic Pong formula. The main aim isn\u2019t about getting the ball past\r\nyour opponent (although it helps) it\u2019s about using the ball to dominate the\r\ngrid that appears on the playing field. The more of the gird you own the more\r\npoints you\u2019ll get at the end of the fast-pasted timer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426fa3a3b7958a0ea24316a55b3f5536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Grant Mullock"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
