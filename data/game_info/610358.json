Its a factory building sim with several idle game mechanics including a prestige system and offline time resimulation. Start by using miners to get a good base of resources. From there the tutorial will guide you through using belts to transport resources and refineries. Refined materials will have a higher value and are necessary to construct more advanced buildings. After a few dozen hours you'll begin to approach 1 million credits which will then allow you to prestige and start again but this time resources are twice as valuable!<br/><br/>This game features completely original music, and approximately 20 hours of gameplay...but this is an idle game so its all depends on how its played<br/><br/>Options include a few anti-aliasing options, Key maps for basic controls, volume sliders and unlockable skins!<br/><br/>This game is open source as well!<br/><br/>Check out the code on https://github.com/maxtarabbia/IdleFactory", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T15:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/354518f551cc159bc3c62c9d4e67cd73_UmE5NwT.jpg", "website": "http://tapinator.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Tapinator", "Maxim Tarabbia"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tapinator", "Maxim Tarabbia"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
