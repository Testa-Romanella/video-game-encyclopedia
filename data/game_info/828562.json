These power cells can power up machines which can be used as platforms. The machines need input from a controller as well. These are either dials, switches or timers.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Tool you can collect in the game is also driven by power cells. With 1 cell you can use it as a simple grappling hook and swing on a pivot from one place to another. With 2 cells you can use its second ability which is pulling towards the pivot point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These points are limited to shiny surfaces only.</p>\n\r\nPerformance:<p>The game is made in Unreal 5 and uses the new Lumen light system, however, this is still a pretty new feature and requires a lot of GPU power. If you experience lag, make sure to check the graphics settings and make adjustments accordingly.</p>\n<br/>Credits:\r\n<p>Sounds came from the following soundpacks:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://shapeforms.itch.io/shapeforms-audio-free-sfx</p>\n<p>https://void1gaming.itch.io/free-sci-fi-game-soundtracks<br/><br/>Special Thanks to Brent Batch,\u00a0ThatStella and\u00a0Matthbo for helping with the level design!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T03:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674ac30e28073d2e390d678b07f79013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alstrak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
