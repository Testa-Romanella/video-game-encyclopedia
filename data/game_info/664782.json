When we grow up we often find ourselves face to face with the expectations of a culture who sees the boss or the manager as the main goal. The higher your role in a group the better. But this pyramid-like structure does not work in design. As we have seen in different discussions and documents (like: \u201cChanging Education for the 21st century\u201d) design is a practice where we often will have to collaborate, learn, seek inspiration and motivation with and from other people (other designers, experts, professionals). Design is therefore more of a group practice where the collaboration between different specialized people will get the best result out of a project.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the game \u201cProject Manager\u201d I tried to show how the organisation and roles (or even attitude) on a project can lead to different results. Things like the time, knowledge, motivation and team size can influence the final product as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>Making this game (made in 1 day) I tried to bring in some ideas on small project management and how those could influence the final result (from taking a few weeks to needing more than a month for completion, from getting good reviews to getting really bad ones, from working alone to working in a group).\r\n</p>\n<p>Of course I\u2019m aware that the management discussion is a lot more complex but I hope that the game could lead to thinking about the theme and maybe bring in some ideas or thoughts on the argument.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Assets pack used is by LimeZu on (https://limezu.itch.io/).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616e3674b277ccaa7e169e552a2b1b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Bad_Hat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
