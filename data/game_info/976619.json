How much will you risk?</strong></p>\n<p>5050 is a simple game of chance. Are you feeling lucky? Insert some points and press the button. They\u2019ll either get doubled or turn to nothing. Your objective is simply to accumulate as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to you how cautious you want to play, but it\u2019s high risk reward. Points in your account are safe, but what fun is safety without progress? With only 2 controls, you must play this game on instinct alone.</p>\n<p>The game is won once you reach 1 million points, and your progress towards this is shown at the bottom of the screen. You can of course keep playing even after surpassing this goal.<br />\nControls:<br />\nThe game was designed with a mouse in mind, but you can also play with the keyboard too:</p>\n<p>Space = Press the button<br />\nArrow keys = Change deposit amount</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T23:08:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca20479725b4aa6fd01fca7b802cb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
