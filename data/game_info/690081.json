To win in this fight to the death, you must choose wisely against your opponents using rocks and paper cutouts of various sharp weapons (scissors). These will determine your probability of winning or losing.</p>\n<p>Mechanics: The core mechanics are similar to the fifth idea of minimalism and keeping controls consistent and straightforward. The mechanics in this game will focus on a turn-based system with the choice best of five over a period of 10 turns in total. The mechanics will be focused on the players choice from Rock, paper, or scissors. These are very basic, with the intent of adding further mechanics and unique systems to differentiate the game from other co-existing mechanics. For uniqueness, the game includes various 3D objects that the player chooses wisely against the opponent. Hitting him 5 times successfully will grant you a victory; however, the same happens if you miss 3 or more times.\r\n</p>\n<p>Aesthetics: The game aesthetics for this development will be simple and basic. The inclusion of a menu, options menu and pause menu will be interface aesthetics. For the gameplay, dynamics and visuals, they will include:<br/>Gameplay \u2013 Similar to Pok\u00e9mon arena battles.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game flow:\u00a0</strong>Game flow includes the use of dynamic features and balance of difficulty and skill:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Submissive<ul><li>A continuous playing environment where the challenge is yourself to make the right choices.\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Narrative<ul><li>See idea 5\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Challenge<ul><li>The battle of guessing but also choosing correctly (strategy) is based on the player's choices.</li></ul>\n</li><li>Fantasy<ul><li>Dinosaur kingdom fighting for the entertainment of the empire.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Set in a dystopian environment.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game feel:\u00a0</strong>The game feel should be similar or comparable to card fighter games like Pok\u00e9mon, where your character fights another opponent while choosing a power-up. However, to keep consistency in feel, the environment is a close 3D landscape where you can play as the character itself, picking your power-ups - similar to Battleships board game, where you cannot see the opponents piece or strategies. This keeps consistent mystery to the game, making the player think more and decide the best possible moves before moving.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1st Version</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>2nd Version</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bac4bd4029b0806c6bf2d08b9c4ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Senpai Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
