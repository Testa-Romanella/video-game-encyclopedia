My vision for the game as I was making it was \"Jump King but 3D\", something that can be beaten quickly if you are good enough at it, but takes a while to master. The game features a local leaderboard so you can track and keep track of your best times. Thanks for checking out my game, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4488d7a504fd426c92759b47fdf795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gabefulk8"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
