Survival can't be accomplished by oneself though, so you need to talk to folks, barter for supplies, do odd jobs, and bring production lines back to life.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The damage has already been done though, and there isn't any silver bullet laying around than can fix the problem. You will inevitably die just like any other wastelander, but you *can* manage the inheritance regarding future generations, and how long will it take until they can manage to scrape by once again.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Jo\u00e3o Oliveira: 2D Artist, Writer<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Luis Chaves</strong>: Developer</p>\n<p>Martim Fernandes: Developer</p>\n<p>Pedro Val\u00e9rio: Developer,\u00a02D\u00a0Artist,\u00a02D\u00a0Animator</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The game is still in development, so expect things to go astray.
