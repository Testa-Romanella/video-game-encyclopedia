{"id": 812188, "slug": "toggle-cube", "name": "Toggle Cube", "name_original": "Toggle Cube", "description": "Toggle Cubes is a game where you have to guide people to the stars by toggling cubes on and off. All the stars in the levels have to be collected to advance to the next stage. You have to overcome monsters, fireballs, and spikes by using keys and teleports.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe people walk predictably, clockwise. So be smart about how you toggle the different cubes. Don\u2019t run into spikes and monsters. If there are more people than stars you can sacrifice some if you need to. Monsters can also collect keys and use teleports.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has a cute isometric art style with a relaxing soundtrack. The game is not too difficult and can be completed in one sitting. You can toggle the colored cubes on and off by clicking the buttons in the hud or using the keyboard or gamepad. Cloud save and achievements are supported.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T04:28:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdbbc1a4295c428cb42311305632dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["NanningsGames"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
