You deal with the most unpredictable cases of exorcism.<br/><br/>This time, you and your team find yourselves in an old mansion in Madyland. According to locals, horrible things have been going on there for years. They remember a young woman who lived there, raising a gravely ill son. Then, she disappeared, and no one has seen the boy since. Many people tried to uncover what happened, but no one has ever returned from the old mansion. Neighbors say, \"There's a lot of evil there!\" <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Exorcism ritual</strong><br/>Your team's task is to perform the exorcism ritual and to free the possessed from the ancient evil. You need to find all the ritual items. The notes will help you figure out what's what. The most difficult obstacle will be the possessed individual himself. He's always hunting, and in moments of rage, he's especially dangerous. But that's not all. You must also beware of his traps.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Sound location</strong><br/>Listen carefully and you'll stay alive. Rest assured that if your heart is beating, the possessed is somewhere near. The 3D sound location technology will help you know where the possessed is and avoid a deadly encounter.
