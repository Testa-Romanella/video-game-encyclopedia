Thank you!*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Based off popular tabletop card games such as Magic: The Gathering and Yu-gi-oh, Acolyte, set in the early 2000s, reminisces of card game tournaments, LAN parties, and...oh WHAT?! little cats??</p>\n<p>*Note: Acolyte is an early Alpha build and will probably not be in further development for the time being, due to other projects and college :(. This being said, you may run into some errors, missing assets/placeholders, and on-screen debug tools.*</p>\n<p>Being my first game, I had a lot of ambition going into development which proved to be fatal to its life cycle as I experienced burn out, poor programming practices, and inexperience. Regardless, I\u00a0learned a TON making this game and won't make these same mistakes in future projects to look out for!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use WASD to move, ESC to access menu and manage inventory, and mouse to interact with cards in combat.</p>\n<p>In combat there are 5 stages; <strong>Draw </strong>(which is done automatically), <strong>Prep Resources</strong> (place mana cards onto field),\u00a0<strong>Harvest </strong>(click mana cards to add to mana pool), <strong>Prep Attacks</strong> (spend mana to place attack cards onto field), <strong>Attack </strong>(cast attack cards to deal damage to enemy). You can also use items by hovering over the in-combat item menu in the bottom-left corner.</p>\n<p>*Note: There WAS controller support, but due to poor development in my early days and GameMaker updates this has been made dysfunctional and may cause issues in runtime*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffab0a11f16594bd30691fba5d4538ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fergo310"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
