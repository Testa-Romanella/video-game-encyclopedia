My name is Alex and this is my very first Game Jam I joined.</p>\n<p>First of all: This game is not finished. This game is just a prototype of a jrpg game inspired by Dragon Quest Games. I appreciate anyone who is willing to test the early phase of this game but dont expect too much there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some Buttons (like the Settings or Save Button) have no functions yet. On these I am working right now and will be added in futher updates. So this game has a level system but will be reset after restarting the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun testing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:54:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a8d49327d5fc84ae572fc1513895ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Einfach nur Alex"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
