Your only tools are your trusty jetpack and your item spawner. But your spawner has malfunctioned and will only spawn random items! You must ascend the tower to fix your tool and defend your outpost from the approaching danger!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou aim to ascend the Spooky or Corin tower(s) before the approaching danger reaches you in this randomized platform spawner game. Spooky Tower consists of over 400+ spawnable items that will assist you in ascending the tower before the Accretion Spider Queen and her brood invade your outpost! Corin tower features 9,500+ spawnable objects to help your ascent as you attempt to reach the top before the rogue moon collides with the settlement.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBoth towers feature a casual mode if you'd rather enjoy a more chill experience and ascend the tower(s) casually without the timed threat of destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, and have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T16:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a89dc949f7af20f3c91526f6916c4161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spaghettiSyntax"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Regnian"], "esrb_rating": null}
