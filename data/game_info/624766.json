Its boring! (Please tell me if you cannot connect to the default server anymore...)<br/></p>\n<p>Its by far my most broken game. Please don't make yourself the effort to report bugs.</p>\n<p>Input is just W/S to (de)accelerate, A/D to turn, \u00a0LEFT/RIGHT to move sideways and SPACE or UP to shoot.</p>\n<p>You can get cannon-upgrades by destroying asteroids. Colliding with asteroids is completely broken. Just try to avoid them...</p>\n<p>I wanted to learn a bit about making a multiplayer-game and mess a bit with polygon interactions. So it's kind of a success, because i learned a lot.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c06e744f6734e8b1c3d8162301ba8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["whiteshampoo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
