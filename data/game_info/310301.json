I have intentionally left out the sound effect and let the music and the scenery express itself. The art style is like someone have just drawn it on a piece of paper. Like planning something. I have pretty much done the game by myself. Except the music. Which is delivered by my for now standard musician: Joshua McLean. And I am not an artist. But maybe one day I get there. I like more for the game. But this is it for now. Happy playing it :)<br/><br/>There is 11 levels to play.</p>\n<p>Oh yes this is a game for the Weekly Game Jam - Week 92. The theme is \"One Direction\".</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/>Space - for jump and start game<br/>Escape - for restart and quit</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Huy Xuan Ngo<br/>Joshua McLean for the music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c941112c0dc5a0b84318968deff012ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Huy5000"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
