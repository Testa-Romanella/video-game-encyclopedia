I was pretty busy during the weekend and sent most of Monday at school so it's not got as much content as I'd like</p><p>TOOLS USED:</p><p> - Unity (Engine)</p><p> - Aseprite (Art)</p><p> - Visual Studio 2015 CE and Mono Develop (Programming)</p><p> - Git (Source Control)</p><p>Instructions/Controls:</p><p> Escape/P: Pause Game</p><p> I: Open ingredients panel</p><p>A/D/Left Arrow/Right Arrow: Move Left/Right</p><p>In the game orders for food come in every 10 seconds, you must not let the orders pile up above 5. To complete the orders you must 'buy' (no money system yet) ingredients, patties for burgers need to be cooked. To make a meal you must use the 'maker 1s' (MK1), you put the food in at the top and when all the right ingredients are added you get the food, to finish it as an order you put it through the vent.</p><p>SOURCE CODE:</p><p>https://github.com/EverlessDrop41/LD37/releases/ta...<br/></p><p>Enojoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee046c4c6fa0f805d7d60466f0e94b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["emilyp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
