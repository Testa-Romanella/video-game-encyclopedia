There are 4 cards at the bottom of the screen which you can click and drag out to the game and the release to create a building. Try to stack as many buildings as you can. You earn points by getting more people to live in your city by building apartment buildings. The buildings are sketchy though. There are things that they don't like and things they like, indicated by + and - in the game. A households happiness-level is indicated by the emoji on the house. Robberies, fires and deceases can happen to the households as well, so you must build emergency services. These events are indicated by other icons. If a building falls onto the ground you do not possess, you loose.</p>\n<p><em>This is what each building does:</em></p>\n<p>-<em>Apartments:</em><em>\u00a0</em>Increases your resident-score.
