{"id": 811799, "slug": "polygon-path", "name": "Polygon Path", "name_original": "Polygon Path", "description": "Controls\r\n<ul><li>WASD: change selected shape or select direction to place new shape</li>\n<li>Space: switch rotation direction</li>\n<li>Enter: place new shape in direction selected with WASD</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Control and grow your collection of shapes using the controls above to <strong>pick a side</strong> to add each new shape (subtle nudge about the game jam theme!). Every shape you add gives you more points, with shapes with more sides giving even more points! (e.g. adding a pentagon will give you an extra five points per second)</p>\n<p>The whole collection of shapes will rotate around the active shape (the one with the googly eyes), and you can switch the direction with space. Move around the collection of shapes and switch rotation directions to avoid hitting the walls or you'll lose the shapes you worked so hard to build. If you have no shapes left to run to, then it'll be game over.<br/><br/>Collect the pickups that are scattered around the map for a score boost and to let you place shapes faster, without having to wait for them to unlock - you can even pick up an octagon for even more points!<br/><br/>\r\nIf you create a loop of shapes that lines up perfectly (e.g. four squares making a bigger square), then you can move around the loop, and your collection of shapes will be more robust to breaking apart. (I mostly just want to highlight this feature because coding it was a real pain!)<br/><br/>\n<strong>Can you score 5000 and\u00a0achieve the S-rank?</strong></p>\r\nOther Info\r\n<p>Made with Godot in 72 hours for the 2022 GeoJam.<br/>Sound effects made with bfxr<br/>Music by DSTechnician from Pixabay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/0700c9b2775844550755ff75382db7d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheJackOfClubs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
