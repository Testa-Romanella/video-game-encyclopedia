Where some lines only look diagonal, one line actually is, and circles look like they differ in size, but secretly, one of them is <strong>bigger</strong> or smaller, camouflaged by the illusion. It's your job to point them out! But beware\u2014the fakers will do everything to stay unnoticed... It's the ultimate test of your focus!<br/><br/>Featuring ten different versions of famous illusions like the Hermann Grid or M\u00fcller-Lyer arrows, each with a number of variants and distractions, for a total of 50 levels! If that's not enough, try the relaxing Zen mode or the hectic Shuffle mode! You can play it together too: as long as everyone can see your screen, you can use the number each illusion is tagged with to discuss and accuse fakers. You can even export your favorite puzzles as a GIF after solving!<br/><br/>Fake Illusions was made by solo developer Auroriax (best known for Mobility!
