I also layered some\u00a0extra point lights with halos\u00a0over the sun to create a glowing effect, and Saturn has a ring. The skybox was also changed to have a different space texture, and the speeds of the planets orbiting around the sun are to-scale based on their actual speeds. To have numbers that weren't integers for the speeds, I changed the RotateAround script to have the rotation speed as a float.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Created by Jacob Helzner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc484fdbf47b42b71a530b6c3ddf6a45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["thenoseofsauron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
