Craftily mixing influences of games like Day of the Tentacle, Dragon&#39;s Lair or Humongous Games&#39; Pajama Sam, it offers its own, original narrative experience, which can be described as both dark and adorable.<br />\nWe take the role of a young princess Tsioque, imprisoned in a castle ruled by the Evil Wizard. At first glance, with her blond hair and big blue eyes, she may seem like your typical princess, but she&#39;s anything but typical. She doesn&#39;t wait for Prince Charming to rescue her - she rescues herself, using her wits, stubbornness, and an unusual talent for bringing unintended chaos and destruction wherever she goes.<br />\nHumor?
