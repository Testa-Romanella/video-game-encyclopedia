Her family is in the rural part of China, where patriarchal and toxic family culture prevails. As the oldest sister of two brothers, she was treated poorly by her parents, which resulted in some traumatic memories that accompany her throughout her life. In recent years, she was able to gradually identify these wounds and started to heal them. In the meantime, she was able to use her experience to help others with similar experiences. Our game <em>Lingering Shards </em>is inspired by her experience, and the theme of the game is about overcoming past traumatic experiences.<br/></p>\n<p>In our game, we bring the story into a fictional modern era China with some realistic Chinese culture, and there are some supernatural events happening in this fictional world. People\u2019s psychological trauma will generate spirits and affect that person\u2019s life. The player plays as Lin - a person who has superpower to see these spirits. This character is adapted from the hidden hero that we picked. The player will enter the client's memory/ spiritual world to collect information about that client and what causes the psychological trauma of that client. After that, the player will use the clues and her life experience to help the clients who have psychological trauma. We hope this game could encourage people with psychological trauma to face the things which caused their psychological trauma and appeal to more people to help and support people who have psychological trauma.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T19:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d07922ac2476d715731819a7bd9cc14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zhang.hongyi", "Yolandaaaa", "timzhang2001"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
