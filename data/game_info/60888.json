The game takes place on the planet called Nimbo. Evil tyrant named Non Sonus became the ruler of all the provinces of Nimbo. He ordered to block all musical energy on the planet, which brought warmth and light to the hearts of the inhabitants of Nimbo. MuzEnergiya was passed on to the nimboses by factories and generators and by the musicians, the same as Krim. Non Sonus stopped the factories, destroyed all the musicbots, but found the last one - Krim - on his gravy ship (the flying tyrant's ship) and dropped it, but Krim survived the fall and was ready to take revenge on Sonus, but perhaps Krim is also the part of plan of Mr. Non-Sonus?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game contains difficult and sometimes hardcore moments, good music, various types of enemies, puzzles and collectables, revealing secret levels and bosses! Fly on a rocket, try on a suit of dangerous fumes, wander in the dark. All this is waiting for you in the game Krim: The Music Bot!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c271680d1f369d4a5d03abcefd03e5c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeeMyGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
