Some fellow classmates told me about itch.io and I followed their advice. I think this game is absolutely fun. I love the controls, the puzzles, textures and design. Seriously if you're bored and you're cool with spending your time playing this game I can assure you, you'll have fun. I plan to release it on Steam with multiplayer in the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c153640b618d8fefda5f01202d4e87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kofi-S"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
