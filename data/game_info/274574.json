No matter! I am your programmer, <em>but you</em>\u00a0can call me master for short.</p>\n<p>Despite my sufficient capability to build an assistant, I am the butt of jokes for being unable to organize my priorities. That's where you come in!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I want to take my programming skills to the next level, yet at the same time I am tasked with the burden of high school. I need to constantly maintain perfect grades... And survive the horror known as\u00a0<em>College Entry.</em></p>\n<p>Quite a dilemma ain't it? Sacrifices are to be made... I'd rather spend all of my time coding but I\u00a0suppose I'll have to balance between the two.</p>\n<p>Your job? To decide what I should do on a monthly schedule!</p>\n\r\nNevermind those \"PL\" and \"World Final's\" I'll probably wound up sacrificing them as well... You do however want to watch out for the exams, I should be well prepared when those weeks come along...\r\n<p>So you have the most esteemed honor of being my secretary and deciding all of my \"appointments\" for me on a monthly basis. Each month you'll tell me to either focus on programming, schoolwork or spend time on both.</p>\n<strong>But you'll find that always mediating won't end well, because sometimes the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.</strong>\n<p>Also as the years go on your choice will matter more so, as whatever I focus on I'll focus on better and I'll steadily forget the things I neglect.<br/><br/></p><p>I\u00a0<em>feel\u00a0</em>that by the end of high school reaching a programming level of 100 would be nice.\u00a0<br/></p><p>(There are 4 endings, which entirely depend on your final programming level: See if you can find them all!)</p>\n<p>The odds may be against me... And you might be my only hope... You ain't got nothing to lose...<em> I on the other hand.. </em>Well actually you do too, if my grades are under threat I don't think I'll be able to keep you running.</p>\n<p>Okay was that convincing? I thought so... See you this September...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e49b72d415ce497daed771443754169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["themadprogramer"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
