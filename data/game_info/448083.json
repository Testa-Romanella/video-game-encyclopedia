Created by Simon Mesnard (ASA, Catyph, Myha...) and magnified by an oriental-sounding music composed by Yazorius, Bo\u00efnihi has a gameplay never before seen in the series, halfway between Myst-like and traditional adventure games.</p>\n<p>\"An astronaut has been wandering through space for 4 years, and finally landed on an uncharted moon, where a mysterious hermit used to live alone. Bo\u00efnihi was his name, and he was one of the rare survivors of a terrible event known as \"Day Zero\", which happened long, long ago...\" <br/></p>\n\r\nBo\u00efnihi is an independent and self-funded game, mainly created by one person. It has been envisaged as a 1st person adventure with a hybrid gameplay (3rd person camera). You will go through an exotic story based on the exploration of a faraway moon and the solving of didactic logical puzzles. This game is reminiscent of the Myst series but also point and click games like Syberia, The Longest Journey...\r\n\n<strong>English</strong> and <strong>French\r\n(DRM-free)<br/><br/>Additional Bonus folder included in this purchase (mp3, video, dvd cover, comic book...)</strong>\n<br/><br/>If you buy the game here on itch.io, you'll have the possibility to request a free Steam key.
