You can really play this how you want but a way I came up with is that you and your friends choose a player you want to win, then you can watch them race as the game automatically tracks each player. You can also boost your player by clicking its button which gives it a boost. You can have 2 boosts per race, or you can double click it to use them at the same time as a mega-boost! You can go up to as many races as you want, Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T21:19:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f61b16ba512827194c7dec2605327299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frog_Craft"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
