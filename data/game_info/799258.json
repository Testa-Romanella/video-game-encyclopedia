Jimmy is the guy the other guys call when they need to finish the job. Jimmy&#39;s Vendetta features dozens of intense newly created arcade-style, city-based missions that keep Jimmy driving, shooting and rampaging through Empire Bay. Missions will unlock as they progress, activating a slew of assassination and timed vehicle missions ending in dramatic shootouts and explosive car chases. Players will rack up points for performance, power slides, and skill shots. The scores will be immediately posted to the new leaderboard system, providing extensive re-playability, as players work to rise to the top of the ranks. Get to know Empire Bay - the executioner&#39;s way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T19:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaecbb9502915b2888091c30686ba2a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["2K Czech"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
