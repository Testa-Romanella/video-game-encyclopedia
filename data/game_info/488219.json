I want to see how a point-and-click styled adventure could function if it were treated like an interactive text adventure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My end goal is to save all text used to play the game,\u00a0so the player can read a final manuscript of how their character completed their story. Using this final manuscript as motivation, I'm hoping players will want to use correct grammar, sentence structure, etc. while playing the game. All punctuation and words that the game doesn't know are ignored, so \"Walk right quickly\" is executed the same as \"Mel decided that she should walk to her right, quickly to boot.\"</p>\n<p>Text is stored in a short list (size of 10) so that the player can repeat actions they previously typed via up/down arrow keys. I'm using 2D physics for this game because I want each player's manuscript to have slight nuances for each play-through. They can store actions by executing them in advance, then cycle back to them quickly when they plan to actually use it. What this means for the final manuscript is that a first playthrough will look haphazard compared to a fully planned run of the game. And for actions that are repeated back-to-back, I plan on replacing that text with \"Again. And again. And again.\" or some form of that, whatever ends up reading the best after testing.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Code:\u00a0https://github.com/seancunnington/PortfolioCode/tree/master/NewHome</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:32:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69cfa15798af34d2f819c0ed4a4a5be5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["socknot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
