The alien is just a kid yet, so can only make two rewinds and then the oldest copy will be forgotten. His father can do all 10 rewinds a time, but this game is not about his father:)</p>\n<p>Help this Tiny Rewind Alien to find exit from these confused rooms. You'll face a lot of buttons which should be pressed, laser walls, and even Sleepy Green something.\u00a0Use the most winding paths, then call\u00a0Rewind!</p>\n<p>I will be very grateful for your feedback!</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p>PS. In the original post I accidentally\u00a0uploaded two versions for Linux and marked one of them as for Windows, so just this version contains the build for Win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a116c48f3e7d92f5126eace1d79e4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daiman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
