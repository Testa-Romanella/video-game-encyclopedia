Unfortunately all the goats are currently stuck on the faraway Goat Starter Island, and\u00a0the path between the two is fraught with peril. Play as the collective will of a herd of goats and guide your flock to\u00a0paradise, trying not to let too many of them get slaughtered along the way.</p><p>Our original idea was a\u00a0creative mash-up of\u00a0Silent Hill, Don't Starve and Sheep. This may have been overly ambitious for the three days we were given, but the end result is a very fun (if short) demo of what this idea could become with a tiny bit more work. It's also a very fine looking island full of very fine looking goats, if I do say so myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671773c8e78de508b239c95793e8571e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Possum Launchers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
