I promise that you can actually play the game this time, as I have made the game more polished compared to sumo ball 1. Quick thing before I start, The web version's main menu has no music for some reason. download the windows version for the best experience.</p>\n<p>After beating the corrupt secret boss in the first game, the game just ended, or did it?</p>\n<p>The sinister ball is back with even more mirrored soldiers at its disposal. For those out of the loop, mirror balls are inverted versions of those with great power, they move as you move, but in reverse!! the only way to beat one is by some conveniently placed spikes on each stage.\u00a0You have to take all of the corrupt orbs that the mirror balls have after defeating them to stop the corruption.</p>\n<p>A NEW CHALLENGER APPEARS -</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention, there will be more characters than just the plain ball to choose from. I will describe the currently implemented ones below.</p>\n<p>OG Ball-</p>\n<p>just a normal ball, use left and right keys(or A and D) to move left and right, use Space to drop down, giving some extra bounce.</p>\n\n<p>Shuriken -</p>\n<p>Imagine the plain ball... but with spikes! This ball has 4 spikes surrounding its body and is always in a spinning motion. These spikes gradually damage a colliding enemy little by little. But the shuriken is extra weak to spikes, so they may take more damage, If you think that is worth it, this is the playstyle for you. The Shuriken is also faster than the OG ball.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you like the demo!</p>\n<p>This game is in NO WAY finished, I will continue working on this if the people like this project. Remember that the windows download is the best experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/931/9314716938415264b14db31a4a484b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SomeoneThatExists"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
