Each time you die you respawn a certain distance behind. With each death the distance gets bigger. If you find your bodies you'll be able to pick up power-ups that give you buffs and de-buffs. Some power-ups are also scattered throughout the world. You'll explore three different levels with different styles and gameplay. Explore them all and beat the final surprise of level 3 to become the ultimate Man In Red!\u00a0</p><p>Developed by four students at FC - University of Lisbon for the course of Game Design and Development.
