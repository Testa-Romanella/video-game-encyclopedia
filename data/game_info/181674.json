I know these \"puzzles\" are trash, but they're still puzzles (FIGHT ME). I took my inspiration from minimalist art styles from games that I made when I first began programming, and from top down legend of Zelda games (but without inventory and special items - working in my constraints meant that the player never gains equipment, but only knowledge to how other parts of a puzzle work), as well as a love of pushing buttons and watching gates disappear.</p>\n<p>I just didn't have the time to create full levels, but I loved playing around with the code to find a way to make this idea work in Gamemaker. And with that, if you're reading this in 2016, I wish you happy 2017, and if you're reading afterwards, happy times to you as well! ~Charles<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb7869499d3ea0e85c01592ddd8c952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hajae Ko"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
