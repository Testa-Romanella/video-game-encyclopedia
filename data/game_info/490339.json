In this game the keys hold these answers, and you need to find them in order to find the exit... the end of the labyrinth.</p>\n<p>There are \"spheres\" to collect, symbolizing the unimportant mundane things (money, food, pleasure, etc). Your soul has no real purpose and the time is ticking. It might happen, that you run into roads that lead nowhere, as life can have dead ends - but you can block these meaningless paths.\u00a0 Using these barricades symbolize the developement of your soul, because this can distuingish the right and wrong decisions.</p>\n<p>However, you have a special kind of enemy: Temptation. It consumes your time, energy or life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, Blue Temptations symbolize Time, Yellow Temptations symbolize Energy. Beware of the Red Temptations as they might kill you or steal all your energy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>3D\u00a0</strong><strong>labyrinth</strong>\u00a0with\u00a0<strong>real</strong>\u00a0movement\u00a0in XYZ\u00a0directions\u00a0</li><li><strong>Procedurally</strong>\u00a0generated\u00a0levels\u00a0and\u00a0environments\u00a0</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>\u00a0logical thinking\u00a0to\u00a0max\u00a0out a\u00a0level\u00a0</li><li><strong>High</strong>\u00a0replay\u00a0value\u00a0</li><li><strong>Achievements</strong>\u00a0for\u00a0certain\u00a0tasks\u00a0(time\u00a0attack, no-kill\u00a0mode, etc...)\u00a0</li><li><strong>Mythological</strong>\u00a0background,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0level\u00a0up\u00a0spiritually\u00a0:)\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/487d3b0506d0ad3837b30e703aea54b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Improvision"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
