The premise is that the Pizza Boy needs to bring pizza to a high rise apartment complex that is inhabited by regular people who are just trying to find something good in this apocalyptic wasteland. However the Bandits need to eat too, and the pizza boy will have to dodge them while still making it to the apartments in 15 minutes or it's free!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Z - To pull out your gun</p>\n<p>Space - To Shoot</p>\n\n<p>Things that didn't make it in:</p>\n<p>1. Enemy Spawns</p>\n<p>2. More then one level</p>\n<p>3. UI Elements</p>\n<p>4. Sound effects</p>\n<p>5. Other menus other then Main Menu.</p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<p>Some wonkiness with Collision seems to be happening. Nothing game breaking but also something to be made aware of.</p>\n<p><strong>Did not add closing the application from a pause menu. The game will need to be closed by hitting the \"X\" button or force closing it. Ran out of time, sorry about that.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:43:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c618bc739a197e5399e0efc98de5866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JmorhaimeGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
