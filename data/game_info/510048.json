So you will have to follow the rules of social distancing while moving across the streets. The length of the distance depends on the level of protection that your mask provides.<br/>\r\nAt the beginning you are a fat sluggard who experiences, what is more, problems with money. In the pandemic situation the role of a delivery guy's job has strongly increased. And as you still don\u2019t have any professional skills, this is an ideal choice for you. Because of suffering from overweight you are able only to walk slowly down the street (not run) but after carrying out a number of deliveries you will lose some weight and make some money. If you want to became fit and to deliver your orders rushing along roofs like a parkourer you will have to keep to a healthy diet and visit a gym. It takes quite a big sum of money and to earn it you should work hard.<br/>\r\nRemember: it depends only on you how you will bring it all together staying under permanent treat of infection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T02:00:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/5607cc8511beea8001b314c7869c5819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Melnikov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tim Melnikov"], "esrb_rating": null}
