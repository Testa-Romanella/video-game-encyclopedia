{"id": 573691, "slug": "dijkstra-inc", "name": "Dijkstra Inc.", "name_original": "Dijkstra Inc.", "description": "<p>[Submission for Mundane Jam (8 Bits to Infinity)]</p>\n<p>Mundane Task: Delivery Boy / Mailman in Office\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme Qualifier: Your energy level (&amp; amount of possible earnings) decay with time.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Dijkstra Inc! The offices in the corporation are a maze to get through. Not every room leads you to where you need to go and you might have to go up to go down. Rather than have employees waste time delivering supplies in the office, it is your job to find your way around. Deliver the requests as quick as you can. Three strikes and you're out!</p>\n<p><strong>Note About the Design</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0am using this game as a prototype for part of a Zelda-ish simulation game I have for the future. It will have dungeons that are Zelda-esque, BUT the side-scroller areas (a la Link's Awakening or Oracle games) will be more than just a way to get from point A to B. Let me know what you think about the concept of getting around. There is an actual 3D layout to the building that makes sense when drawn out on paper, but I'm not sure how well it translates to the actual game. Please let me know. I will try to include a graph in the screenshots of the possible room connections (i.e. Dijkstra's algorithm shortest paths) as a cheat just in case. SPOILER: If you do not want to see the possible in-game paths, do not look at the image at the end of this description. (Although it doesn't tell you which boss is in which area, so it won't help too much.)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/WASD - Walk</p>\n<p>J/X/Enter - Accept,\u00a0Interact</p>\n<p>K/C/Backspace - Cancel, Jump</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Un-implemented Ideas</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Uses for money - unlocking paths, energy refills, time extensions, map of building<br/></p>\n<p>(If you see the empty cafe rooms, this is why.

You have about 5 minutes to complete each task, and the energy timer is designed to last about 15 minutes. (Both work, but I just don't want you to waste your time.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/065bb1e8f4e65cb5741daf8f8eba3532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MetaphysicsStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
