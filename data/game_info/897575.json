I am hoping to extrapolate and combine the two in a future project at a later date. You can see my first SimpleRPG project here:\u00a0https://xvcrimsajadevx.itch.io/simplerpg-prototype</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: Arrow Keys or WASD</li><li>Attack: Space Bar or J key</li><li>Roll: M Key or K Key</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Github Repository:</strong>\u00a0https://github.com/xvcrimsajadevx/Godot-Projects/tree/main/Action%20RPG\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Further Development:</strong>\u00a0Will be extrapolating aspects of both the SimpleRPG and Action RPG tutorials and combining the two in future projects. There was a lot to take away from this project in particular, such as the use of a state machine, the use of colliders, and the hitbox and hurtbox (though I will probably use my own terms for those since I kept mixing the two). Also, the use of reusable components in general. This was an amazing course, and I decided to explore Heartbeast's content further before taking on my own project.</p><p>You can see my progress on <strong>Heartbeast's 1-Bit Godot Course</strong> below:</p>\n<ol><li>Rocket Launch\u00a0- Complete\r\n</li><li>Piggy- Complete\r\n</li><li>Space Shooter\u00a0- In Progress: Custom Font + Changing Scenes Next\r\n</li><li>Metrodvania - Pending\r\n</li></ol><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T12:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d33/d33cea945586b0795cba08ee85c71b82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
