It\u00b4s local multiplayer, has 5 skins and 9 guns to choose from.\u00a0\u00a0You just shoot at each other until you die. Bullets and med packs fall from the sky. Some guns can break boxes, but in general you\u00b4re safe behind a box. I plan on adding maps, power ups and consumables later on. It has to be played with 3 players (sorry haven\u00b4t implemented 2 player game yet, you can just leave one player to the side).</p>\n<p>Menu controls:<br/></p>\n<p> Click a character to choose it and press Space to lock it, same with weapons</p>\n<p> After all three players and guns have been chosen the game starts</p>\n<p> You can come back to menu by pressing Escape during the game</p>\n<p>Game controls:</p>\n<p> Player 1: WASD (S to shoot)</p>\n<p> Player 2: UHJK (J to shoot)</p>\n<p> Player 3: Arrows (Down arrow to shoot)</p>\n<p>R: respawn everyone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T06:49:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/242/24244975b4b829eec850c814fd9ad094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AveragePerson22"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
