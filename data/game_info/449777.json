It's amazing how much understanding and calculation a pilot needed to avoid being hit at any height from the ground, and all done manually.</p>\r\nThe gameplay\r\n<p>You're<strong> trying to survive</strong> the first Kms on enemy territory before getting to your main objective [in a future update].\u00a0</p>\n<p>You only have <strong>4 bombs</strong> so use them wisely. Each bullet the enemy waste trying to kill you and each enemy killed with your bombs\u00a0will increase your <strong>Honor Score.\u00a0</strong>Be remembered as the hero you are!</p>\r\nSome clues...\r\n<p>The anti-aircraft guns will try to\u00a0<strong>predict your behavior</strong>\u00a0based on the direction and speed you had when you appeared on their radar. The \"beeps\" indicate their count down to<strong> start shooting</strong> at you.</p>\n<p>That means that you must continuously change direction. Pay attention to the <strong>beeps. </strong>The shots will be\u00a0spread a little because the enemy knows you have great evasive skills.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54ce1948a5251a3f44cd8549e5ed6f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ossete Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
