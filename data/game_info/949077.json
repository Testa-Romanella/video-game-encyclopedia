Either a fruit or an object can spawn in the middle. If a fruit spawns, player one has to hit the A key and player 2 has to hit the L key faster than the other. If an object spawns, you don't have to hit it and just wait for it to despawn. If you hit it, you get penalized with being unable to move for some time.</p><p>If you want to help me with development, you can answer this form:</p><p>https://forms.gle/7BkBpi3Q5dTZKUw39<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70bfe2023249b2b938177685943fedc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaKu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
