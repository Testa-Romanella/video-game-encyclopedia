In and out, back in time for a good\u00a0night's rest... None of us knew there was a damn mole in our ship. Led the\u00a0rebels straight to where we warped in.</p>\n<p>Somehow I'm still alive. I'd thank some deity if it weren't for how they killed my squad. And everyone else for that matter. Seems I'm the last one left here, Got a small fighter ship, limited ammo in my Vulcan chain-cannon, a few seeker missiles - that's gonna have to keep me alive against who knows how many rebel ships, wish I had a smart bomb. Not to mention my damn limited fuel. I guess I'll have to hope these rebels are careless with supplies... I dunno who I'm even talkin' to right now. Maybe I'm hoping someone else from the carrier got out, is listening to me now or something?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well whatever... Just, if you're out there, wish me luck...</p>\n\n<p>Find the game dev log here\u00a0https://evoelise.itch.io/sector-104/devlog/107816/sector-104-devlog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131da2809983f83ce35e4edc502cb5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evoelise"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
