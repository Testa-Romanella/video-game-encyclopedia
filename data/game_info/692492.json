On their own, each level presents its own challenges, including jumping, avoiding enemies, avoiding environmental hazards, and using enemies to solve jumping puzzles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) Finally, I modified the User Interface of the main menu to accommodate the theme of the game, a light hearted return to a power once lost (falling off the ship), and the extra levels I added. I also added some new visual elements to the main menu, to build character for our astronaut hero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the game, all of the sprites and sounds were provided by the instructor, while the level, story, and characterization of the main character were done by me, Carter Brown.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T11:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/994bc29c47f4626cf755f6583e6a977e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gcbg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
