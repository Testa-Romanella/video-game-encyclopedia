It is a demo and it is far from what I wanted to make. The audio was created in only 5 minutes (don't expect much lol) but the graphic was made in 1 day, and the other was programming the game (which was more complicated than I expected)</p><p>Gameplay:<br/>Fight the enemy while trying to gain the trust of a virtual girl in the game! Gain the trust and fight the final boss without dying to win the demo!<br/></p><p>The game is being developed into more story driven, but since I'm submitting it to a bullet hell game, I decided to focus into the bullet hell genre, but in the next development, I will focus on the story part...</p><p>You can also help me to focus more on game dev, and I will credit you in my game description and game credits, link is\u00a0https://ko-fi.com/kuritzu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:56:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/71210ed470373914ce4779f3174c4805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuritzu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
