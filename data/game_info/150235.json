You have to avoid <strong>guards, security cameras and lasers</strong>. The whole complex diffuses disco music, which is your main weakness. If you get too much into the groove, you will have nothing left but to dance as much as you can to reduce your FUNK Fever.</p>\n<p>If a guard catches you, you\u2019ll have to restart the level. To avoid getting caught, you can place yourself against a wall, and if you really have to dance, hide in a secondary hallway. </p>\n<p>However, if dancing may be dangerous, you\u2019ll be able to pass through lasers with your disco skills ! (but you can\u2019t see them, they\u2019re lasers)<br/></p>\n<p>This is a submission for the 41th Ludum Dare.
