I have the basic infrastructure in place, and it is technically playable, though. There are two product shares available to buy/sell; Cola and Coffee. The prices fluctuate up and down, within a certain margin, and it is your job to decide the best time to buy or sell.</p>\n<p>Currently there is no real use for the in-game money, aside from buying stocks. But, I\u00a0have plans to change that in the future, such as some kind of upgrades you'd spend your money on.</p>\n<p>Note:<br/>I only have access to a Windows PC, so the Linux version is untested.<br/>Feedback as to whether it works, or if it works differently, is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Game Controls:<br/>Up and Down Arrow Keys\u00a0- Navigate Shares<br/>Left and Right Arrow Keys - Buy or Sell Shares<br/>Z Key - Save Game<br/>X Key - Load Game</p>\n\n<p>Current Features (v0.2):<br/>-2 Products<br/>-Fluctuating Share Price<br/>-Ability to Save and Load</p>\n<p>Potential or Planned Features:<br/>More Products<br/>Upgrades to Purchase<br/>Multiple Game Screens and Menu`s\u00a0(possibly a graph screen)<br/>More, More, More...
