However these black lines\u00a0shouldn't ruin the game experience.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>History of the game (nobody cares why I am writing this):</strong></p>\n<p>I'm a newbie in game development, and I decided to go solo (what a stupid idea). I couldn't come up with a decent idea for 2 whole days. Then I worked 14/24\u00a0hrs for the rest of the\u00a0days to make this game, and I'm not happy with the result. That sucks!</p>\n<p>And I also made some bad choices, like creating this huge sprite sheet of the player: it's useless, in the game\u00a0you can't see the whole animation</p>\n\n<p>(it took me 6/7 hours to do this because I'm not an artist, you can use it in your game if you want).</p>\n<p><strong>What I used:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Engine: Unity3d</p>\n<p>Art: Piskel</p>\n<p>Sound: FamiTracker</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:36:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3cbc692e9259b1c22aa9acdae6825d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CahGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
