From tid-bits about the person's life, you can either send them straight to the afterlife if they died wealthy, or compensate by having them make up the margins through tasks. Try to balance out saving time getting as many people as possible in to the afterlife while also making sure not to mess up! So far there are 3 minigames, but we might add more in the future. We hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c2/1c274c46d6b17a4d94444bfd55e65c6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlphaDown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
