His goal achieved, he grinned at the sleek monitor in front of him and, too tired to walk to his bed, rested his head somewhere between QWERTY and XCVBNM where he started snoring softly.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tStill nestled in their digital realm, nine retro sprites, smoothly animated and painstakingly debugged, comfortably awaited their unveiling just a few hours away.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tMaybe it was the face resting on the keys unwittingly combining a myriad of keystrokes in some command previously unknown to humankind, or maybe it was just the ghost in the machine, but suddenly the lovingly crafted digital world lurched. Each of the sprites was jarred out of their reverie as the realms collapsed, whirling and swirling in a maelstrom of hue and pixels. Full screen effects flashed fuscia and shook, tearing at the seams of the screens. Sound effects bristled their displeasure as levels peaked and distorted. And just as this digital universe seemed ready to collapse, the chaos stopped. The volume dropped. And an uneasy hush fell over the game.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAs the sprites awoke, groggy and disoriented, they each found themselves transported to an alien world. Each landscape was as beautiful and fully realized as the home they had left, but felt ill fitting like plaid over polka dot, or dress shoes worn by the lakeside. One by one they rose and started searching for a way back home.\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tText by Daniel Bailey.\r\n</p>Credits<p>This game was made for the Gamer's Rhapsody and Composer Quest \"I Barely Survived That Game Jam\" game jam in October 2015.<br/>\n</p><p>Game design and sprite art - Charlie McCarron\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBackground art - Will Tice (tilesets available through unTied Games)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAdditional sprite art - calciumtrice (goblin, cleric, rat), Stephen Challener (robot), Shepardskin (cat)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSound design - Topher Pirkl\r\n</p>Composers<p>\r\n\tAaron Buckley<br/>\r\n\tAdam Scott-McGuinness<br/>\r\n\tAlexander Gleich<br/>\r\n\tAmy Scurria<br/>\r\n\tAnthony Webb<br/>\r\n\tBijan Eghtesady<br/>\r\n\tChristopher Scullion<br/>\r\n\tDaniel Bailey\r\n\tDaniel Darjean<br/>\r\n\tEdgar Anguaino<br/>\r\n\tGeaspar Warfield<br/>\r\n\tGiovanni Tabor<br/>\r\n\tJake Downing\r\n\tJames Fabio<br/>\r\n\tJosh Wilson<br/>\r\n\tKasey Polk<br/>\r\n\tMichael Chergosky<br/>\r\n\tNathan Franks<br/>\r\n\tRayan Karapet<br/>\r\n\tThor Bremer<br/>\r\n\tYishan Mai\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDownload the soundtrack at https://composerquest.bandcamp.com/album/pixels-at-an-exhibition\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/2269948fff03825406c83ebe85fc1170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Composer Quest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
