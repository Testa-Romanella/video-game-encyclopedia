{"id": 306370, "slug": "slydrs", "name": "Slydrs", "name_original": "Slydrs", "description": "In this block-sliding puzzle game, solve 48 levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is made of a differently shaped grid of squares, and contains a variable amount of funny cute orange-colored robots and switches. To complete a level you must place a robot over each switch. Do it by dragging the robots horizontally or vertically. The tricky part is that the robots slide in a straight line until they hit an obstacle.<br/><br/>In the first levels you can move the robots without much thinking, and you will eventually succeed with a relative ease. But completing advanced levels is more challenging, and requires to think of a strategy before performing most moves. This is even more true if you want to reach the perfect score, the fewest moves needed to complete a level.<br/><br/>For each level, your best game (or fewest moves) is saved and can be replayed. This is useful if you want to improve or share your moves.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>- 48 levels in 4 environments<br/>- Replay your best game for each level<br/>- No timer, play relaxed<br/>- Shiny and cute visuals<br/>- Engaging audio", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75cabdc61832d3db3cd9fca377c63a44_IzogDmd.jpg", "website": "http://www.gamezhero.com/games/slydrs", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Denis Sokolov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Denis Sokolov"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
