Each department has Morale, Productivity, and Income. As each department earns money, their morale will slowly decrease, and it is the player's job as the business owner to do things to prevent low Morale.\u00a0\u00a0If a department has no morale, then no money can be made. The Office is \"In The Zone\" when morale is high and everyone is making money.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One challenge I\u00a0had was giving this little office personality, so to do this - each employee can have random events happen. These events can be Good or Bad, it just depends on how the Employee wants to be. Each employee also has their own personality, hobbies, and interests. So if you notice an employee who is Angry or Happy, tap them to see what's going on during their day. You can also tap on employees to learn a little more about who they are.</p>\n<p>This was an extremely fun Jam to take part in, and I\u00a0hope everyone enjoys this submission. Thanks so much for your interest, and time!\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Music Attributions\u00a0(No changes were made)<ul><li>8-bit Pack 1:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-pack-1\u00a0<ul><li>Produced by Tad</li></ul></li><li>8-bit Pack 2: https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-pack-2\u00a0<ul><li>Produced by Tad</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Art Attributions<ul><li>Modern Interiors: https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors<ul><li>Created by LimeZu</li></ul></li><li>Modern Office:\u00a0https://limezu.itch.io/modernoffice<ul><li>Created by LimeZu</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Font Attributions<ul><li>Press Start 2P Font:\u00a0https://www.fontspace.com/press-start-2p-font-f11591</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Change Log's and Patch Notes can be found here:\u00a0https://tinythegamedev.itch.io/my-little-office/devlog/337103/changelog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a077873f0b3646a2557df1947e1c1d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TinyTheGameDev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
