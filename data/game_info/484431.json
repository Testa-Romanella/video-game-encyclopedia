This just zooms your browser, but works to scale the game up as well.</p>\n<p>ALSO<br/><strong>It's possible that there will be few or NO OTHER PLAYERS online</strong> when you play. To test that the game is in fact multiplayer and you can see other players, I recommend opening up at least two tabs and joining the game twice on the same team (so that both vehicles start near each other). You can join different teams, it will just take you some time to get to the other side of the map.<br/><br/>FINALLY<br/>The full world view triggered by TAB has something of a 'fog of war' effect, in that your client will only reveal the world within a certain distance from you, which may explain why you don't see much painting when you first join, depending on who has been on your side of the world. Somewhat intentional, somewhat a result of not finishing it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n<p>-TyPhyter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf896a06876b68a87fda5d740559cc2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TyPhyter"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
