(and in TIMED modes, in as fast a time as you can for bonus points, and be quick! - or you may lose your turn...)<br/><br/>BIG points are not the ONLY way to play the game - you can also play sneakily (as well as strategically) too, to stop your opponents from getting a better score, or force the end of the game by blocking potential moves by your opponents! - Once the board is exhausted, a one-time DOWNFALL can turn the tide, and create a few more moves!<br/><br/>Blitz mode features an ever-decreasing meter that need topping up with the higher-scoring moves, and is a blast!<br/><br/>Limited Moves mode features a starting pot of moves, with no time limit, and again gives extra moves for great scoring moves!<br/><br/>The latest added 'Puzzle Mode' does away with mental arithmetic, and you can just concentrate on solving the puzzle layouts! (nearly 100 so far, and increasing with each update!)\u00a0<br/><br/>I've just added automatic per-level Puzzle Mode save states too, so you can take a break and return to the bigger, trickier puzzles, whenever you like!<br/><br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE! - This game is STEAM-based, and\u00a0I know that DRM can be a HUGE sticking point on here, but the only (and unavoidable) reason that I have to sell my game on ITCH.IO\u00a0as\u00a0Steam keys is that I use Steam's infrastructure / API functionality to add a lot of playability/value to my game (Leaderboards, Achievements, etc, and soon to be added - Cloud Saves, and Online (as opposed to the current Local) Multiplayer!).<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that you can appreciate that I'm in an unavoidable position of being tied to Steam key sales for this release\u00a0as a result...\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0...Thank you for your understanding, guys!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T07:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/0776b7534321ed85e4712dcf28fc6603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Japster's Cavern"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
