{"id": 137827, "slug": "coral", "name": "Coral", "name_original": "Coral", "description": "<p>Coral is a meditative, instrumental, flash game centered around balancing a set of enso circles at various heights. Players can \"sing\" to a circle, raising it, by pressing a unique combination of two keyboard keys. However, the letters needed for each circle overlap, causing a unusual array of keys the player must press or not press, to adjust the circles to the desired heights in perfect harmony. It began as a 48 hour jam game at the Babycastles X Parson's jam, where it took home the Judge's 1st Prize, and I continued to work on it for several months in free time afterwards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/626819560c8f934a5e90e5b8e3b10ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robert Meyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
