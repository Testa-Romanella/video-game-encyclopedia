Unfortunately,\u00a0due to the lengthy upload time on here, I was unable to complete my itch.io publishing in order to\u00a0submit in time.\u00a0 I decided to keep working on it for a few hours and see if I could finish. I figure this should be a good test as the game jam itself ran for 3 days but I\u00a0did not notice it until I only had about 7 hours remaining to submit.\u00a0 This is about 13-14 hours of work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0a1580927467ce6a867f4ca981bc484.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["weenie.walker.games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
