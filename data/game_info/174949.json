The crystal heals you but it can also be destroyed by the enemies coming from above. You need to defeat the enemies and gather points, but the more points you have, the more enemies spawn and the harder they get. There are also powerups which can replenish your health, give you extra damage or max health, or restore the crystal\u2019s health. Enemies also kill themselves after time, however they don\u2019t give you points for that, so be quick and kill them first!</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>v0.1 (03.12)</p>\n<p>-initial release</p>\n<p>v0.2 (06,12)</p>\n<p>-new logo, help menu, game over menu, crystal texture</p>\n<p>-moved highscore text in title screen to left</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/2211a406147ced2273a503178d4225e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NNNIKKI"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
