The story is there are anomalies swallowing your planet and you have to eliminate those anomalies by going to the floating temple orbiting. There you have to collect the destabilizers (purple stuff) teleport to the planet(dark side) and exit through one of the corresponding anomaly. But be careful you can get stuck in a closed room and eventually anomaly will spread enough and end you. Also you can use the anomalies to travel faster through the temple but you can't stay too much inside.</p>\n<p>To teleport, enter the anomaly, press grab and pull with your hand.<br/><br/>Get the purple destabilizer and destroy the anomaly on the dark side (the planet)\u00a0with teleporting, but be careful you might be destroying your only way out of a room.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e177166022715a0654969634d6cfe1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doom4e"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
