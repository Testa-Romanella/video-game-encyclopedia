The RPG element brings classes, skill trees, and looting system into the title. The available classes are warrior, mage, and thief.<br />\nOne of the main focuses is on the realism \u2014 the game features a vast variety of deaths, for instance, death from frostbite if the character does not dress well; death from hunger in case the protagonist forgot to eat, and death from poisoning if the hero ate a suspicious flower in a middle of a woods.<br />\nThe battles are not of the primary locus here \u2014 nonetheless, the system is simple and concentrated on hitting, casting spells and dodging in the appropriate time. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player follows a storyline of a heroine who is destined to prevent Ragnarok \u2014 the death of all the living creatures according to the Norse mythology. The Valhalla stories, as well as the Tales of Nine Worlds here, are cleverly mixed-up with the postmodernist gags, forth wall-breaks, and even Harry Potter references. The game&#39;s source of inspiration is often confused with Skyrim. However, the developers say, that story resembles Quest for Glory in various ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d80c04d1e76c1b53141c2b72ffaafdfb.jpg", "website": "http://www.crystalshard.net/hq.htm", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 63, "owned": 1368, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 24}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 67, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 67, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Screen 7", "Crystal Shard"], "esrb_rating": null}
