The old version was horrible. It was slow, clunky and ran at an awful resolution. So a year later I remade it in 1 month and fixed everything that was bad about the old version. I hope you enjoy my first game of many more to come. Have a great day.</p>\n<p>You can Find me on :<br/>Newgrounds - http://assrgbgnome.newgrounds.com/<br/>Itch.io - https://assrgbgnome.itch.io/<br/>Game Jolt - https://gamejolt.com/@AssRGBGnome<br/>Twitter - https://twitter.com/AssRGBGnome<br/>Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7FLDudCQ4Xrzoc5ol3C3Q</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9c0abdb3f3b818aa79e980da0c42158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AssRGBGnome"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
