( Tap! )</p>\n<p>Space will force the raft to move on ( when you're on it, ) if you think you've gathered enough treasure for the day. Left/Right will jump off the raft.</p>\n<p>Left bar is your oxygen, and the right bar is how much time you have left - which is where the raft is across the screen.</p>\n\n<p>It's a bit clunky.. but would certainly like to return to it at some point if there's interest. Total time spent was probably 5 days on and off. Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Web Version added 21st April.. and is just a direct export using the HTML5 module with no changes ( which makes me wonder why the right bar is in a bit, but oh well )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f614d4f8923113a69974f5011787631d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Arcade Badgers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
