Demo of the demo, if you will. It has bugs and placeholder animation. This little piece we used to test out how the mood and pacing works.<br/>Known issues include first audio not triggering, weird clipping in couple places, dialogue advancement triggering too soon. Unfortunately this build is now taken apart in order to build up new systems, thus will not be updated. But we will be happy to hear any feedback you might have :] <br/></p>\n<p><strong>A Bit Of Lore</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The world is painted in greyish tones of Southern Gothic landscapes. The resulting mood has the sense of\u00a0 an unexplained elusive presence. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Our Hero falls asleep on the train and finds himself at an unknown train station. The story about finding a place to sleep until the morning steadily spins into a night of kafkaesque characters with their own agendas; mundane yet absurd world; bigger than life god-like entities; irrevertible dream sequences that impact reality; a world which is governed by seemingly familiar, but yet vaguely unsettling rules.</p>\n<p><strong>When The Proper Demo Is Out?</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, funding for the Demo fell through, so previously announced publishing date had to be cancelled. I keep looking for it, but am very caucious about dates (finally).</p>\n\n<p>While we're searching for funding, do join our DISCORD !!!<br/>...and visit our webpage.<br/>...oh, and Twitter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65237def56c79faf148ed6a25ebe48b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GRUNND"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
