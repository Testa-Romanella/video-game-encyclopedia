An epidemic has broken out and the Animals \r\nare getting a taste for their own kind. You must fight through the \r\nlevels to beat these made creatures and find the Rebellion!</p><p><strong>Why did I stop production</strong></p><p>I had great fun designing this and I had quite a lot of ideas in place for it but the one thing holding me back was assets, it was hard seeing the game I had designed at first when I was using primitive cubes and when I made the switch to paid assets the game felt 100x different but the more I worked on it, the more it didn't feel like my game because I was using someone elses assets that were publicly available. I wanted to wait until I was able to create the game in it's own image.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/544813a46912477f86f76afa6fcc9130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jakes Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
