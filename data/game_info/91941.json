This is just the beginning!</strong></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls are WASD and space to jump, left click to fire and right click to pickup heavy items etc - Escape button quits (and options for mouse sensitivity)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KEYS 1,2 &amp; 3 set hand, gun &amp; tool modes - use the right tool for the job.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0A video walkthrough will be recorded soon, unless you are a youtuber and you want to help out - record your own, let me know and I'll link you up (or post a comment with the link below)</strong></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Massive thanks as always go to my friends, family &amp; especially to my super supportive wife.</p>\n<p>Also thanks to Katy Darrah who helped with a lot of testing on this game (will add you to the games' credits page as soon as I add a credits page to the game.
