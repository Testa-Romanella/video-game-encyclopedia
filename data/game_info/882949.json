[/b]<br/><br/>Destroy various hordes of enemies with your highmars in different locations and defeat their bosses!<br/>Do not forget about upgrades, they will help you win!<br/><br/><strong>Historical timeline and background of the game</strong><br/><br/>On February 24, 2022, a full-scale war began in our country - Ukraine.<br/>russia began massive missile attacks on our cities, targeting military facilities, russian precision has already destroyed thousands of civilian homes across the country.<br/>Ukraine's partner countries, such as the USA, Germany, France, etc., predicted that Ukraine would last no more than a few days...<br/><br/>At the time of this writing, the war has been going on for nine months.<br/>Millions of people, one way or another, faced the consequences of schizophrenia and inferiority complexes of the russian military-political leadership (aka vladimir vladimirovich putin). Tens of thousands of people have already died, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.<br/><br/>In the city of Mariupol alone (still occupied at the time of writing), the number of victims of russian aggression and torture is more than 20,000 people!<br/>(this is unofficial data, real numbers may be much higher)<br/><br/>The developers of the game in no way minimize the importance of war, tragedy and pain that we ourselves and our brothers and sisters have faced.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to highlight for our foreign friends the real \"greatness and might\" of the russian army.<br/>But one information field will not help our Heroes. So we decided that in addition, we will send 30% of the profit of the game to our dear volunteers: \"Return alive\" and \"Serhiy Prytula Foundation\".<br/><br/>In addition, you can make a donation to the official funds for the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine by yourself.<h3>What's in the game now?</h3>Please see the related item in the early access section.<br/><br/><br/>The game may contain bugs.
