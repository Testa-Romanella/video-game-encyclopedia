Jump through the cellular mass and shoot the Spawners and the Phages.\u00a0<br/><br/>2. Buttons from \"NorthWest\" and L-R: Jump- Switch special weapons- Shoot- Fire/Use special weapons\u00a0 \u00a0 There's als a Pause button on the left above the D-Pad.</p>\n<p>3. The double jump when not falling uses a very strong Super Jump which helps you get to those really high places. It takes some practice.</p>\n<p>4. The special weapons are: a. Mines\u00a0 \u00a0b. Waveshot\u00a0 \u00a0c. Shield\u00a0 \u00a0d. Bouncer Ball\u00a0 \u00a0e. X-Ray\u00a0 \u00a0 f. Phase\u00a0 \u00a0 All except the Mines\u00a0use up your Firepower. You can replenish Firepower as well as health from different Molecule Powerups.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0You can destroy the Cells with 5 shots but if you destroy too many- the White Blood Cells will come out. And those can be destroyed with some effort but even more will come out. If you hide away and let them be they will probably take care of the Phages for you.\u00a0</p><p>6. The X-Ray Beam can be rotated by holding Up or Down. It vaporizes Cells very quickly- so be careful.\u00a0<br/>7.\u00a0\u00a0The Phase can be used to get out of some tough spots quickly or to jump through thick cellular masses- but be careful or you'll Phase right through the floor! And then- Game Over!</p><p>9. Thank you for playing! I\u00a0hope you have a lot of fun!\u00a0 \u00a0X D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T18:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba8/ba8984ba78cf771bcc88d8de2c1714bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theclevername"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
