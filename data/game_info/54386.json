The game uses a relatively large 32-megabyte cartridge and can also use the Expansion Pak to allow for better graphics but slows down the frame rate. It has a 4 player split-screen multiplayer mode that uses a first-person view.</p>\n<p>The plot revolves around time-traveling aliens attempting to alter the course of history and eliminate Duke&#39;s ancestors. Locations, weapons, items, and clothing are relevant to the time period Duke is in.<br />\nThe game has an opening intro that explains the concept of the plot. The game also has many mature plot elements. In one stage, Duke time-travels to the Victorian Era and finds the still-fresh murder scene of Mary Jane Kelly. She had been slain at her residence of 13 Miller&#39;s Court on November 9, 1888 by Jack the Ripper. In another, Duke must travel through a New York devastated by atomic warfare.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-30T21:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f309a616406584f3abdf1611f406554b.jpg", "website": "http://legacy.3drealms.com/zerohour/", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 8, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["3D Realms", "Eurocom", "Eurocom Developments"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["GT Interactive Software", "GT Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
