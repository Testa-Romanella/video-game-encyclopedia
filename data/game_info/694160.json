A gem with\u00a0extraordinary feats, being able to provide you with special powers. Except, until they are brought to the surface, the crystal is highly unstable. This makes it so that while beneath the ground, its power fluctuates at random. Getting to the crystal was the easy part, but now that the traps have been activated, things got a little more difficult. Use the power of the crystal to reach the surface and claim its power!</p>\n<p>For the those who want a challenge: Collect the extra Chaos Crystals ( 2 Per Level ) which decrease the overall time intervals between power changes!</p>\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n<p>- Almost didn't join cause I was lazy but I'm so glad I did! I feel like my skills completely improved over this short span so that was amazing.\u00a0This was one of my more aesthetically pleasing games, which is pretty\u00a0cool.\r\n</p>\n<p>- I\u00a0like lights now.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Definitely got a little rushed at the end, so Levels 2 and 3 are a little poorly designed.\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Because of rush, there's bound to be errors and bugs; sorry.\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Oops... made it a little too difficult for the majority...</p>\n<p>-\u00a0I accidentally deleted the old game page...
