We do too! So here is a Zombie inspired version of the classic game, Snake, on a cube, 6 planes, can you believe that?! Using <em>WSAD</em> or the <em>D-PAD</em> (on an XBOX 360 controller) to guide your hero, flee the zombies for as long as you can, get all the loot and save other survivors. But you know, in the end it's pointless, and they will get you.. but that's ok, we love zombies. See you on the other side... </p><p><em>*queue willhelm scream*</em></p><p><strong><br/>tl;dr</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Use WSAD on keyboard or the DPAD on controller to move your hero around the surface of the cube.</li><li>Collect crates and other survivors for 'points'.</li><li>The game gets faster with every additional zombie chasing you, so collect those crates and save those survivors as fast as possible!</li><li>Share screenshots of your high scores with friends!</li></ul><p><strong>Updates</strong></p><p><em>May 3rd, 2014</em></p><ul><li><em>Re-enabled controller support.
