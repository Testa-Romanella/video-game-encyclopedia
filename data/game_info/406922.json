{"id": 406922, "slug": "the-tester-doublew", "name": "The Tester (DoubleW)", "name_original": "The Tester (DoubleW)", "description": "<p>The Tester is a simple 2d Platformer except all the basic game mechanics are bugged in some way. As you go through the game you unlock more powerups/abilities but they don't always function as you think they will. Backed up by a simple story, The Tester is a difficult yet fair action platformer that should take no longer than 5-20 minutes to beat depending on your skill level.</p>\n\n<p>This game is my submission for Wowie Jam 2.0! I'm really happy with how it turned out especially since this is the first game I've actually finished.\u00a0With that said, I'm certain it's not flawless so if you have any feedback or criticisms please leave them in the comments. Be honest with your criticisms. Honest feedback is always the most helpful feedback so just keep it real. (you won't hurt my feelings lol)</p>\n\n<p>Also if you aren't playing on a 1920x1080 screen you may run into some problems with the UI in the game. Again, this is the first game I've completed and I\u00a0had to finish it\u00a0under a time limit so I wasn't able to iron out all of the issues with the game. Regardless, I hope you're still able to find some enjoyment while playing the game.</p>\n\n<p>Last thing! There is a hidden easter egg in the game. I won't give any hints but you'll probably realize it's an easter egg when you see it (it's art style doesn't match the rest of the game). It's pretty hidden so kudos to you if you find it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T05:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42b72b5216f652de75709ef087f24d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoubleW"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
