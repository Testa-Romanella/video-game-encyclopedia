I knew things wouldn't be as grand as I thought (it's my first game jam), but I didn't get to dedicate enough time as I wanted and I have little to show for it. At the very least I wanted grass along the ground and to make a little theme, but all I can offer is a cloudy silent crater with an ugly flower in the middle. The controls were mostly taken from the Unreal Flying Example Project, with slight tweaks to the speed. I planned to add more to it, but well like I said, I didn't dedicate enough time.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I'd feel a lot worse if I didn't upload this. Even if I'm not proud of the result (admittedly I am proud of the bee I made though haha), I need to take the step and upload it. So I can say that I've put myself out there in some fashion, and that I can do better next time.<br/></p>\n<p>I promise to perform better in future game jams.\u00a0Or at least plan more accordingly for them in terms of time. It might not look like much but the time I spent working on this was wonderful! I look forward to participating in more game jams :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/9666b323ac3a35907373c62dfaa815e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mexicanpenguin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
