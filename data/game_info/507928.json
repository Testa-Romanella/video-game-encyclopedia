It's the first time I've created a platform/shooter game so I wanted to shake up the mould a bit. There are four distinct zones in the game and level three is deliberately different, just to break up the platform hopping and do a run/shooter instead.</p>\n<p>Please rate my game if you like it. Your support is much appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd5bec0a5e116b99a4b67a12b42032de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Xerra"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
