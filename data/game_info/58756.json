The main purpose of the game is to live the sport in its entirety. Feel what it is to be a talented street skater.  Explore and tame the concrete, film yourself, your friends and share your footage on the internet with the worldwide skateboarding community.<br />\nSession focuses on the authenticity of skating, both in the way the game feels and is presented to the player.  Based on this philosophy, each feature makes the game even more innovative, fun and respectful to the skateboarding culture.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-22T08:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/aba/abacd48c118ea106e27f1730f74e0e42.jpg", "website": "http://www.crea-turestudios.com", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 95, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 36, "dropped": 10, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 653, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["crea-ture Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["crea-ture Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
