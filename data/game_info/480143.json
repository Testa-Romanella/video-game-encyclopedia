It doesn't have a bunch of features, there is no levels randomization and actually it's extremely far from polished AAA title like Diablo. Since there is only 1 quest in the game, finishing it takes ~15-20 minutes. Nonetheless if you want to download and play the game for some really weird reason, you can do it here. Game files are quite big (4gb zipped) because of Paragon models which have 2k textures.<br/></p>\n<p>Input:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - follow the cursor<br/>Right Mouse Button - go to location</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3, 4, Q, E - abilities</p>\n<p>Left CTRL - highlight items<br/></p>\n<p>Click on an enemy - attack (will automatically attack nearest enemies after the main one is dead)</p>\n<p>Click on an item - pick up (picking up might feel a bit jerky since you actually are forced to click on the item, not the item name)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c0a240f1f991f190cce78f690c6cb63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatDino"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
