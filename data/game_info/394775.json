With your help Chan can (Maybe) focus on one style of writing and make a dazzling debut into the writing world!</p>\n<p>This game has 13 endings... sort of. The three best endings wont be done by the Jam deadline, but I am working on them and in the meantime there are nine other\u00a0 endings to see!</p>\n<p>Also to make the deadline I had to color over my sketches, so some of the images are... rough. I'm not the best artist, but I like to think I'm better than this!</p>\n<p>******</p>\n<p>This game was made for NaNoTwiMo. Having never used Twine before I stuck with Renpy, which was allowed! One of the goals was to learn or gain mastery over a tool and I think I am now the master of text buttons and basic screens.</p>\n<p>That being said I recently played a twine game that really motivated me to learn the... software? I think that's the right word. If there's another TwiMo I want to try actually using twine.</p>\n<p><strong>Sorry, I can't figure out how to make renpy games playable in browser.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>XxxxXxxxX</p>\n<p>(Edit as of posting)</p>\n<p>So I know I said I'm working on the rest, and I was! But some things happened, not just in my life, but in the world in general and now I can't do anything.\u00a0<strong>anything.\u00a0</strong>Not make games, not play games, not read or get out of bed...</p>\n<p>You don't care, but in case you're someone who liked the game and planed on waiting on the finished version this is for you.</p>\n<p>I've had depression for years and it's not a hard to deal with but when something knocks me down, it knocks me WAY down. What's happening right now is a huge blow and I just can't with anything. I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>I really do love making games and when I get out of this hole I'll go back to working on this one. Usually I'm back to normal after a week, but what's happened is more than I've ever dealt with before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I haven't proofread yet and\u00a0I probably shouldn't share this yet, but I promised myself I'd finish a Jam so\u00a0 this is it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T03:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba2/ba2906143220bfc031d183acd9753925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jaydalyn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
