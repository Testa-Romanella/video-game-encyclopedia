If you are about to get attacked by a ghost, hit spacebar to throw a coin at it. Alternatively, you can throw a coin near a ghost, and if the coin lands within earshot, the ghost will get distracted while you sneak by. Don\u2019t be too greedy with your coins; the more you have, the more noise they make when you run. There are 14 floors total, see if you can reach the top!</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 40.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/4958f58817f93c21f37c1f27bfb24d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
