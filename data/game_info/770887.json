Then, make a run for it and go through the level in reverse under a time limit to get away.</p>\n<p>The levels get longer and more complicated as you progress - You are rewarded for remembering your way back and managing your resources.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD: Move around</p>\n<p>Left Shift: Dash</p>\n<p>1-5 or Mouse scroll wheel: Cycle inventory slots</p>\n<p>Q: Drop item</p>\n<p>E: Interact</p>\n<p>Left click: Attack/Use held item</p>\n<p>Escape: Pause</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Lazy Duchess - Programming, Art, UI</p>\n<p>KoryBagel - Environment and texture art</p>\n<p>CurtisSmithSound - Audio design and implementation</p>\n<p>Daniel Tu/lilcjttu - SFX</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<p>You can take torches off walls with E. You can attack with them and even drop them to make a path and find your way back to the starting room. Get to know the level before stealing the fragment and starting the countdown.</p>\n<p>Keep moving and try to maneuver around the skeletons as much as possible. They're faster than you, but turning and getting hit can throw them off.</p>\n<p>Manage your potions and keep an eye on your health - Your state transfers between levels.</p>\n<p>If you're not finding any enemies, you're likely heading into a dead end.</p>\n<p>You can sometimes find a Castle Key item that you can use to open closed doors and potentially find more loot.</p>\n\n<p>Engine anti-aliasing is present in UI elements for clearer icons and text.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6c168a3348928839e303992d82e47a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["curtismith04", "Lazy Duchess", "lilcjttu", "KoryBagel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
