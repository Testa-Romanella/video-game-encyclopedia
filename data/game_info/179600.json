There's a lot of life to live and I only want thirty seconds of yours, once per day.</p><p><em>30 Second Quest Fest</em> is a mobile games experiment.  Basically, I wanted to question a bunch of underlying game design norms.  For example, what if you couldn't replay a game immediately after losing in it?  What if that wait time was elongated to a few days' time?  Would you learn and get better at the game?  Would you even play it if your time was in part scheduled by the game itself?</p><p><em>30 Second Quest Fest</em> is a lot like <em>WarioWare, Inc.</em> except probably not as fun.  Still, I'm glad I put it together and I hope it makes you think just a little bit.</p><p>I currently only have an .apk available for Android users.  An iOS version may be available in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389279a48af9b1dd8795b6e80e951278.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Eric Guadara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
