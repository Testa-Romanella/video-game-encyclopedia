You are one of them. \"The award you will be given will be in proportion to the quality of your work\", the king said. \"The quality of your work\", you think. He doesn\u2019t care about the quality, he only cares for what he can see with his eye... You will have to build the top of the towers, for that is where the king will look first. And if you can show the king how much you have built, you will surely be given an extra award.<br/><br/>Castle Builders is quick board game where players are competing to build most important places in new castle.
