I will be uploading prototype builds over time here. Would love to hear feedback and any bugs you may find!</p>\n<p>Aim of this game. In the end I want to have a voxel space game with cross device gameplay(Flat Screen/VR). Would like to make the two player types work together making use of their skills for example drones are small so they can get to small spots while the VR player can make better use of buttons and devices. Would like to work in some kind of story and server program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If ya like you can check out my twitter, I post things I have made in unity.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/WireMonkeyGames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:18:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98f/98f8ef1140f41cd8622663774ad31c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WireMonkeyGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
