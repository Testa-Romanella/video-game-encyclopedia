When the tray fills up, the cake is baked and scored.</li><li>You get\u00a0a recipe for each cake. The total score on tiles with a given ingredient has to at least <strong>match the number in the top-left corner</strong>.</li><li>Tiles with the same ingredients <strong>fuse together</strong> when placed next to each other.</li><li>Tiles with different ingredients interact through <strong>links</strong>. There are colored knobs on the sides of tiles. A red knob means that a tile will link with a red tile in this direction (the color of the score tag matters). Tiles earn bonus points when linked (equal to the lowest score already on them) and swap places.</li><li>You can use all that swapping to <strong>make combos</strong>, which score extra points to\u00a0all the tiles in your tray.</li><li>Every link or fuse that you make earns you an <strong>extra tile</strong> to use.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/4402fd963d86a3fb7f5b8d2283d53fa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jakub Wasilewski"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
