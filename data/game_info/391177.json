I'm wanting to see what people think of it and any ideas people may have to improve it. At the moment power ups don't have any sounds and sometimes may last forever. I am thinking of adding a method of collecting a form of currency which could be used to buy ship and thruster customization, and maybe also add enemies at some point but since I'm a solo developer this may take a while, as I'm very busy these days with adult life.\u00a0 I think it feels as simple as an old style single player arcade game.</p>\n<p>Any feedback I would appreciate. Please donate if you feel like you want to, I'm broke lol. Trying to get into indie development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c75416c58cec56b847f20c152b863d96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["khadenstudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
