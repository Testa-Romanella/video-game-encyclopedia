Most things in the game will kill you instantly if you touch them. This is a difficult game that takes some practice to beat. When you have learned how to pass a section you can finish it very fast though.<h3>Story?!</h3>There is a big party on top of the castle, but Big Yeetus is late! The entry has already closed, so they need to find another way up to join the party.<h3>How To Play</h3>You can walk, jump and rotate. The cam will follow your movement, but the 3rd person perspective doesn't make it easier sometimes. Avoid all the traps on the way up and master the difficult jumps, and use the few checkpoints to respawn if you die.<h3>What to Expect</h3>If you are very fast you can complete the full course in a few minutes. But getting this fast will take A LOT of practice, so you will die very often and you will have to restart from the bottom very often. The course is built so player skill and experience matters most, there are basically no RNG components in the game.<h3>Traps</h3>Some traps are very straight forward, but others are hidden and you have to be lucky to miss them on your first encounter:<br/><h3>Jumps</h3>A few jumps look difficult but are easy to master and a lot of fun:<br/><br/><br/>Other jumps look easy but are actually reall hard.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T04:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/416/416c1865b38503df6e833d9ac9b5e3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heye"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Heye"], "esrb_rating": null}
