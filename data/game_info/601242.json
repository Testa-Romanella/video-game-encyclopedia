Little game\u00a0made with Bitsy!</p>\n<p>Special thank you to those in the bitsy discord who kept answering my questions on how to work things :p</p>\n\n<p>My first game ever!</p>\n<p>I think it should work correctly, but if you run into any issues just let me know.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to control the character. Walk into things to interact with them. Anything that is the same color as the character is an item/person you can interact with. Some things will give different dialogue if you interact more than once!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is about 5 or so minutes long</p>\n\n<p>I named this version 1.0 just in case I want to add something else later (more rooms in the house to explore?) but this could very well be the final version.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I am on twitter instagram and youtube!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Nnoodlebird</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/nnoodlebird/</p>\n<p>(will put youtube link in later because I'm in the process of transferring/renaming my account right now)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T04:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47e/47eb07140f52cd872d2516854f4feeff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nnoodlebird"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
