It's also my first foray into visual novels using Ren'py.<br/></p>\n<p>This story stars Lieutenants Lwiassi Azodi and T'neth. Lwiassi is a Betazoid and T'neth is a Vulcan.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the story takes place in 2370, with flashbacks to 2364 and 2365.</p>\n<p>Though this visual novel does feature choices, no choice seriously affects the outcome of the story, and there is only one main path.</p>\n<p>This story is fairly short. It should take you less than an hour to get all the way through it, depending on how quickly you read.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This story contains depictions of ableism, sci-fi racism, and discussions regarding sex.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bce6cd9ea1037067a5ffa1e4bdce763.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alimakesrpgs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
