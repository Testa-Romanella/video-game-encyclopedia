The Mercury blob itself has now been given an overhaul and has 4 varying &#39;states&#39; - Normal, Solid, Fast and Slow. These states allow for larger more complex levels, which in turn mean a greater challenge and more enjoyment to be had for the player. The number of levels has more than doubled - now 160+, and with the newly added feature of Downloadable Content more levels will be made available at a later date. Wireless 2 Player modes have also been an important addition, with 5 sub games each providing a challenge against the computer or a friend.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2006-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T12:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/82a/82af942af02509584fdc3a12f5461d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "PSP"], "developers": ["Ignition Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ignition Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
