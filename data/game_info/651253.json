You can wishlist it here\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n<br/>\n<br/>\nKraken Academy is no ordinary high school. Ghosts fill the art department, cultists meet below the monkey bars and now crocodiles are eating children. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin forces with a magical Kraken to uncover the Traitor, a malevolent mastermind, who could be anyone at the school. With each time loop you\u2019ll get closer to saving Kraken Academy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile saving the world is definitely an important goal there's a whole range of other activities to dive into. Learn teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 routines as you explore every corner of the campus during this three day loop. Attend a costume party, become a detective, and help the school's janitor bring down a crime syndicate. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKraken Academy is split into four clubs: Music, Art, Sports and Drama:\n<br/><ul>\n<li>Join the alternative Music Club and complete the school\u2019s edgiest rock band.\n<br/></li>\n<li> Flex your creative flair in the Art Club and show off your work at an exhibition.\n<br/></li>\n<li> Compete in challenges to become the ultimate warrior in the Sports Club.\n<br/></li>\n<li> The Drama Club may be full of snobs, but if you can't beat 'em, join em! Who knows, you may even become a star in their next extravagant play.\n<br/></li></ul>\n<br/>\nLucky for you, you can join them all! With the help of your magical amulet, become a member of a different club during each time loop.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKraken Academy is a melting pot of wacky personalities. In the Music Club alone you will meet pretty boy and lead vocalist, Vladimir, who struggles with keeping his hysterical fangirls at bay; ill-tempered bassist, Simona, always seen in her giraffe hoodie, who hates everyone (including you); and Broccoli Girl, the drummer, who just can\u2019t get over her ex.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo come on! Grab your uniform, magical time-travelling amulet, and ignore the voice in your head that says this is a terrible idea!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T19:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d4/0d435e35fcb4272b2e2efe5c0881f702.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Happy Broccoli Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller"], "esrb_rating": null}
