{"id": 14430, "slug": "lugaru-hd", "name": "Lugaru HD", "name_original": "Lugaru HD", "description": "Follow Turner, a rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills in his quest to find those<br/>\t\t\t\t\tresponsible for slaughtering his village. Uncover a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt<br/>\t\t\t\t\tleaders of the rabbit republic and the wolves of the nearby lands.<br/><br/> <strong>Streamlined Combat:</strong> Gone are the days of combo memorization and button mashing.<br/>\t\t\t\t\tLugaru uses a context-sensitive combat system to put all the moves at your finger tips. It\u2019s<br/>\t\t\t\t\tup to you to choose the right move at the right time and think your way through the fights.<br/><br/> <strong>Open-Ended Strategy:</strong> Each level presents you with an environment and a series of enemies.<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow you choose to defeat your adversaries is entirely up to you. Storm in from the front and<br/>\t\t\t\t\tfight everyone at once or ambush your foes one at a time with stealth attacks.<br/><br/> <strong>Ragdoll Physics:</strong> Not only does striking your enemies do damage, but so does colliding with<br/>\t\t\t\t\tthe environment once you\u2019ve knocked them off their feet. Nothing does more damage than a<br/>\t\t\t\t\tswift rabbit kick that sends the enemy hurtling into a stone wall.<br/><br/> <strong>Environmental Detail:</strong> Factors like wind direction and whether or not you remembered to clean<br/>\t\t\t\t\tthe blood off your knife affect your ability to sneak up on the enemy undetected.<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBrutal AI: Enemies in Lugaru prefer unfair fights. Expect them to shout for back up, attack in<br/>\t\t\t\t\tgroups, and exploit any superior weaponry they can find.<br/><br/> <strong>Moddability:</strong> Turning on Lugaru\u2019s debug mode gives you access to the map editor so you can<br/>\t\t\t\t\tbuild your own levels, campaigns and mods. Debug mode also enables crazy cheats that allow<br/>\t\t\t\t\tplayers to fly, have infinite health, explode enemies\u2019 heads and set themselves on fire further<br/>\t\t\t\t\tigniting anyone who comes too close.<br/><br/> <strong>New HD Textures:</strong> The original Lugaru has gotten a more modern, graphical makeover while still<br/>\t\t\t\t\tstaying true to the game\u2019s spirit.
