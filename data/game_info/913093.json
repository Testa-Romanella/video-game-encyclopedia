I also changed the way some objectives work! and I hope you enjoy this new release!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95dfe4e549a5e92367726b255bd9e44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lifeless Carrot"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
