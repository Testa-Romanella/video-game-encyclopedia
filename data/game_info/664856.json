I added extra elements to make Match Me more enjoyable like matching gems in groups of 3 or more; add bombs and other custom objects into levels; creating custom layouts; an objective to get three stars in every level; a complete level select system and adding audio to Match Me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I learned creating Match Me was mainly its interactive menus and understanding the capabilities of 2D development in Unity. My problem-solving skills have developed my game development because of its object-oriented programming works in place.<br/></p><p>Controls:\u00a0left click to move objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T07:19:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a59863f51d87f3b47dfe3a932e7d4b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
