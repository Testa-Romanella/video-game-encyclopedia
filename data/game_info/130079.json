As you play, you will slowly unlock an increasing number of blocks which could possibly come falling down! This set of blocks expands far beyond the 4-square world of tetris and into larger, more complex square sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a video game, that's why! Unfortunately, I never have any original ideas for new plots or game mechanics, and my art skills aren't too good. Naturally, I decided to take a classic and mix it up a bit!</p>\n<p><strong>Any Bugs?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game is a bit quirky at the moment, but I've dealt with all the bugs I've found. I haven't tested the windows and mac releases of the game, as I don't have access to devices running windows or mac, so I don't even know if they work.</p><p><strong>Is it worth paying for?</strong></p><p>Probably not, but I'll let you decide that for yourself!
