There are 3 values shown: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>H is the height above the surface.</li><li>Symbol Down is the speed towards the surface. Negative numbers means you're falling.</li><li>F is the remaining fuel.</li></ul>\n<p>Your Pico Guidance Computer is marking the landing site with a bright green circle.</p>\n<p>Use the Left, Right, Up, Down button to target the bright green circle with the dark green cross.<br/></p>\n<p>Use the X button to activate your rocket engine to decelerate your fall. Of course this burns some fuel.
