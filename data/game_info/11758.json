Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success.<br/><br/>But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly.<br/><br/>This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever.<br/><br/>Slammed! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices control the story.
