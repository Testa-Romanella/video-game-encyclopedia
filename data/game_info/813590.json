Instead of spamming weaponry out and about, your major duty is to surgically and wisely position and reposition the Turrets you have to hit the jackpot.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3></strong><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>The protagonist is an orange Squirrel!</strong> And he's the one in charge of moving, placing, and replacing your Turrets! Cool, right?<br/></li><li><strong>You're always moving.</strong> As we mentioned - this is a fast-paced Tower Defense game. The better you react, the better the outcomes will be.<br/></li><li><strong>Decisions matter.</strong> Would you rather purchase a new Turret or upgrade the good old Gatling Gun you purchased 2 minutes ago? The game has no story, but bad decisions will lead you to your fall.<br/></li><li><strong>Puzzle-like maps.</strong> Each map requires you to think differently. Recycling strategies might not always work, so you have to decipher the patterns!<br/></li><li><strong>Gore!</strong> I mean, quite cartoony, but still - gore! When you kill your foes, you're going to see them explode... a bath of blood and body parts!<br/></li><li><strong>Easy to learn, hard to master.</strong> The basics are easy, but mastering the mechanics to hit the Flawless status demands you some experience. #gitgud</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T05:02:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb9c7094428be2a8b63b66453f466f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vincae Entretenimento"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vincae Entretenimento"], "esrb_rating": null}
