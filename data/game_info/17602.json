{"id": 17602, "slug": "the-magic-circle", "name": "The Magic Circle", "name_original": "The Magic Circle", "description": "You are the protagonist of an unfinished 1st person fantasy game, trapped in development hell. The designers (played by<strong> James Urbaniak</strong>, <strong>Ashly Burch</strong>, and <strong>Karen Dyer</strong>) are god-like, but so indecisive that they've given you no powers whatsoever. With the help of a mysterious disembodied voice (<strong>Stephen Russell</strong>) you must seize the tools of game development from these unworthy 'gods', uncovering more of the darkly comic story as you go. Rather than traditional puzzles with a single solution, the incomplete state of each environment is a question that you answer in your own way. Trap the designers' creations, steal their behaviors, and re-mix them to explore and master this world-in-progress. Can you out-think the game gods? Can you ship The Magic Circle from inside it?<br/><br/>Warning: Some strong language and references to adult subject matter.", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2015-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162ca2439336d0c07e2de2d7c397e9f5.jpg", "website": "http://www.magiccirclegame.com/", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 528, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 16, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 45, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 47, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Question"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Question"], "esrb_rating": null}
