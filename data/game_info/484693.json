At the eleventh hour before their awakening, three heroines have gathered and arrive at the fortress: Ariel, the chosen one; Billie, a dragon-slaying princess from the north; Celsia, a witch-turned-magician with stellar talent, but no temperament to speak of.<h3>Analyse \u2014 equip \u2014 destroy!</h3><br/>A number of bosses stand in the way before the heroines can take on an ancient god. Strategic combinations of equipment and skills are required to stand a chance. After each battle, a new piece of ultra-legendary equipment is acquired which provides higher stats, a passive effect and a powerful skill. Only the most synergetic combinations may prevail against the power of an ancient god!<h3>Oh, and there\u2019s other Things \u2026</h3><br/>Follow delightful conversations, solve puzzles, collect collectibles and listen to some self-written music. Find metroidvania-style items and upgrade your Celestial Tea while you\u2019re at it! Maybe you can even fill that fourth character slot with an unexpected, but powerful ally? There\u2019s a lot to do, all crammed into a 5-hour experience.<br/><br/><strong>Get started now!
