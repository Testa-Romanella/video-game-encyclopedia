Pilot two ships that spin and weave through an obstacle course in order to fire their weapon.\u00a0With funky graphics and a catchy soundtrack Torque is sure to blow your mind! Both because it's so fun and because it's just incredibly hard.</p>\n\n<p>===INSTRUCTIONS<br/>Use the arrow keys to rotate your ships. Rotating will charge your weapon. Hold X to activate slowmotion. Your weapon will not charge during slowmotion. Once your weapon is sufficiently charged it will automatically unload onto the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>===CREDITS<br/>Programming &amp; Design by Rob van Saaze<br/>Music by Nik Sudan, Fantomenk &amp; Bossfight</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df996b3658a6599ed399d87e0e33ee9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobVanSaaze"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
