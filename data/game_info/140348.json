For my project, I wanted to build a space that allows the player to be alone and explore. For me, being alone in the woods is both relaxing and terrifying. There's the uncertainty of what might be waiting for me, but there's also the familiarity of the sound of birds or the wind blowing through the trees. You're left alone with just your thoughts, and sometimes that can feel more threatening than any creature you might encounter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1276476d306eb9035db3def9896957e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kelsey Ogata"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
