Thank you for being by my side on this adventure.\"<br/>HUNT GAMES.<br/><br/><strong>HISTORY</strong><br/><br/>You are on a poor island where most of the inhabitants have left the island, due to the fact that it is a slum, the island was gradually becoming desert. One day, all the cars, pieces of earth, cans, objects and others, this sound began to rise towards the sky and all of a sudden, time stopped. A rumor has it that it is a black hole that would have stopped time, which explains the objects floating in the air, but we do not understand why there are no more humans on Earth. Grumpy, the frog, lived in the shantytown since his birth, curious since his childhood, he decides to leave and see what is happening all up there. The other frogs tell him \"You're just a simple frog, you won't make it\". Since this sentence, Grumpy has only one thing in mind: Everyone go up there.<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>You control a frog that performs jumps based on the energy meter, which builds up to its maximum when you hold down the space key on the keyboard. The moment you release the space key on the keyboard, the height of your jump will depend on the amount of accumulated energy. It is crucial to release the space key on the keyboard correctly, otherwise you may not jump if the energy is insufficient. You also have the option to control the frog in flight, but with certain limitations.<br/><br/><strong>LEVELS</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>The further you progress through the game, the more you will encounter a variety of gameplay phases, each offering a unique experience and relatively high difficulty. You will have to experience 2D phases, from above, areas where you will have to make sure to land on small objects, make choices between different paths, cross aquatic phases, and many other challenges! It's up to you to discover these diverse and captivating gameplay phases!<br/><br/><strong>FLAGS</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Collecting flags is of great importance if you want to avoid starting the game from the beginning in the event of a fall or death in-game. These flags allow you to respawn at the location where you touched the last flag, which is very practical to avoid redoing all the phases of the game. To reappear at this precise location, all you have to do is press the E key. However, keep in mind that you are only allowed 3 \"reappearances\" per flag. Once these 3 respawns have been used, you will no longer be able to respawn at the last flag touched. To re-obtain all 3 \"respawns\", you will need to touch another flag that has not yet been activated.<br/><br/><strong>DIAMOND &amp; KEY</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the game is primarily linear, it does offer the opportunity to discover diamonds and keys. These items will allow you to open doors that require a certain number of diamonds or keys to unlock rewards such as more diamonds or keys, access to teleports to progress further in the game, bonus flags, and many other benefits. Finding and collecting diamonds and keys is optional, you have the freedom to complete the game without collecting them if you wish.<br/><br/><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br/><br/>I sincerely hope you enjoy this game. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments and rate the game. However, I want to warn you to be careful not to damage your screen or any other equipment on your PC, as this game can be particularly demanding and frustrating. It is important to note that to complete the game, your frog must be blue in color. If it stays green, it means you haven't finished the game yet. I wish you all good luck and above all, have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T04:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16e/16eb2d71cf4db966bdc9a58ae27380a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NYF", "Weien Meng", "Hunt Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NYF", "Weien Meng", "Hunt Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
