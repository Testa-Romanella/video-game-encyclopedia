I would like to add that I do not own any rights to Mario games, this is purely for educational purposes. My aim with these prototypes is to show how this can be done and in turn learn how to be better programmer myself as I constantly find new techniques while streaming these little segments on Twitch.</p>\n<p>The project will feature Version 2 at some point which will add 2 player, but that is in far future for now this project is marked as finished and is on hold. I will be streaming my next series from 15/03/2021 on Twitch.</p>\n<p>For the sound within the project I used the following site:</p>\n<p>https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/</p>\n<p>They have sprites/sounds anything mario related.<br/></p>\n<p>I stream Monday to Friday from 10-11 GMT+0, The streams are fully uploaded to my Youtube 1 week after the streaming date.\u00a0 I do not prepare when I stream in advance however I do sometimes do some small elements off camera such as bug fixing or reworking some mechanics, the aim of the streams is to show how one can quickly make a basic mechanic that works in a real scenario.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitch at:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/snake551\r\n</p>\n<p>Subscribe to my Youtube:\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkBdh2usaVsm3O9vIKpg_bA</p>\n<p>or Visit my Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/4QpHAKM\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Github repository:\u00a0https://github.com/DominikWaldowski5510/AssetLessMarioLike</p>\n<p>I answer any programming questions to my best ability during my streams and on my discord.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game instructions:\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>A/D - Left Right</p>\n<p>W/S - Secret</p>\n<p>Alternatively xbox controller can also be used.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36af3766dc0e1f5002b5fe38c06b4375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dominik Waldowski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
