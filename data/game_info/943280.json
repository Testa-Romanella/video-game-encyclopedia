A refugee from Cambodia, one would not expect that she has undergone so much - she is my hidden hero. Her resilience and grace are incredibly admirable. Her big hobby is gardening, which she makes look so easy. This simple game illustrates her skills as I imagined them as a kid\u2026I know now it takes a lot of hard work, knowledge and an all around green thumb to be able to do what she does.</p>\n<p>These are only some of her plants, just the houseplants. She actually grows a lot of fruit  including gogi berry, kumquat, dragon fruit, guava, jujubees, Cambodian bananas, and lots of herbs. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T23:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49eaa1616d29c031131c8ba0b48d13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Willa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
