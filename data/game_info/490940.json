When a nearby police cruiser stops to investigate he finds a shocking discovery- bodies, mutilated in horrific ways. Who could have done something so vicious in this town? Five suspects are brought in for questioning and case just weirder and weirder. Odd things begin happening at the precinct during the interviews, and all of them seem to be hiding something.
