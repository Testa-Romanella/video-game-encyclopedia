The game at its core is a competitive platformer that\u2019s all about maintaining momentum with skilful navigation. The players compete to be the last robot standing. Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race! <br/><br/><br/><ul><li> JOLT \u2013 A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects <br/></li><li> VOID \u2013 Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination <br/></li><li> Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players <br/></li><li> Chaotic, fast paced rounds <br/></li><li> Skill and Timing based gameplay <br/></li><li> Multiple Tracks <br/></li><li> Multiple Game Modes <br/></li><li> Create your own Robot</li></ul><br/><br/>The JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race.
