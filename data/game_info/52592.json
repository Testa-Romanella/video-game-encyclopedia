{"id": 52592, "slug": "spy-hunter-1983", "name": "Spy Hunter (1983)", "name_original": "Spy Hunter (1983)", "description": "<p>Spy Hunter is an overhead view, vehicular combat game developed by Bally Midway and released in arcades in 1983.</p>\n<p>The game draws inspiration from the James Bond films and was originally supposed to carry the James Bond license. The object of the game is to drive down roads in the technologically advanced \"Interceptor\" car and destroy various enemy vehicles with a variety of onboard weapons. Spy Hunter was produced in both sit-down and standard upright versions with the latter being more common. The game's controls consist of a steering wheel in the form of a futuristic aircraft-style yoke with several special-purpose buttons, a two-position stick shift (offering 'low' and 'high' gears), and a pedal used for acceleration.</p>\n<p>Spy Hunter was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit family, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Apple II, ColecoVision, MS-DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System, and BBC Micro. Spy Hunter was followed by Spy Hunter II which added a 3D view and two-player split-screen play, a pinball tie-in, and a successor series of games bearing the Spy Hunter name. In addition, the NES received an exclusive sequel titled Super Spy Hunter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/308100da708a1f45e586a6a34dfec309.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 18, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 23, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 23, "platforms": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy Advance", "NES", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Midway Games", "Bally Midway"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Midway Games", "Bally Midway"], "esrb_rating": null}
