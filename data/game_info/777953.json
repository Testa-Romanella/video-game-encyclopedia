It was a fun way to pass time as students were arriving and a nice way to end the day too. If you're teaching a class, I think this game may be a good fit to add to your collection of ice breakers and end-of-day activities. If you're not teaching a class, I hope that this is a fun game to play with your friends or by yourself.<br/><br/>\u00a0Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T17:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/983/9835ad763a90a9584e256bed6e040fdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vaasu"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
