{"id": 134581, "slug": "zombies-2600", "name": "Zombies 2600", "name_original": "Zombies 2600", "description": "<p>Zombies 2600 is a simple and fun twin stick shooter done in the style of the Atari 2600. Save survivors while holding off the incoming zombies. Save at least four out of the eight survivors each level to progress to the next level. Partial gamepad support (No button reconfig).</p>\n<p>I made this game relatively quickly as a way to brush up on C#, and also learn the Monogame framework. I had recently bought a new pixel art program, Aseprite, and noticed that it came pre-loaded with color palettes for a variety of classic consoles/computers, including the Atari 2600. I thought it would be fun to develop a quick and simple game with it. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>The game is open source and can be found on GitHub</p>\n<p>Available for Windows and Linux!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e3e8534fb06560b0c9953438130d7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Archendrus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
