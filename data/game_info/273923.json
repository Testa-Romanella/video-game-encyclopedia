You need to arrange the elements to complete the magic circle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Same elements can be merged together (yes, like domino), you will win if the circle will be closed. But one thing you did not expect: this ritual needed a sacrifice.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>And if you have nothing to offer, you may be sacrificed yourself. Demon will try to interfere your ritual and to break out the circle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has his own deck of ingredients, and he will add them, making your ritual impossible to finish. If you run out of cards, demon will take you.</p>\n<p>This game is some kind of spin-off of our bigger project October Nights, so, many hand drawn images by @ambientchild are re-used.\u00a0<br/>Music by @askania_m<br/>Ideas, Game Design, Programming by @shiitman and @gene_besserit.</p><p>upd.
