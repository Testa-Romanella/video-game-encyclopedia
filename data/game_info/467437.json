Suddenly a door to his room opens loudly. *Sound of the door opening.*<br/></p>\n<p>Jerry appears with an insidious smile. *Everybody hates him because of his stupid pranks.*</p>\n<p>- Do you know what I got behind my back, Larry?\u00a0 - says Jerry intriguingly.</p>\n<p>- No, I don't, Jerry. I'm very busy right now. - utters Larry crustily.</p>\n<p>- I HAVE LAZZER! - shouts Jerry. He draws a laser from behind his back and points it on the possum.</p>\n<p>Possum panics. He jumps on Larry, scratches his face, then gets to Jerry's laser and swallows it. Few silent seconds later, Larry smiles with his scratched face.</p>\n<p>- It ends here. Take your animals, Jerry, we're gonna fight. - says he, as he squeezes the possum.</p>\n<p>- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>\n<p><strong>(No animals were hurt during this fight and subsequent development of this game)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:27:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/7715c98958f245b308b877724e0fc4fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TheCake", "Valeriy Petrov"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
