In fact, some of you managed more than ten Villaintines, a grand feat! I hope you all have the same performance this year too!</em> </p>\n<p><em>Now, before we start this year and I let you go to your assigned Villaintines, let's all state the Princess Code:</em></p>\n<p><em>I, state your name, would uphold the school's mission to clear the world of evil. By giving love to those scorned and turning those monsters into angels. I will be a representative of Peace, Love, and Tranquility...</em></p>\n<p>The Princess knew the code by heart. She is one of the many in St. Goals who wants to help turn a Villain's life around by showing them that someone out there can try to understand them. That there's someone who just wants to be their friend and show them love.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, she failed last year's assignment so this year might just be her chance to achieve something... in apparently, just <em>five</em> days.

I'm referring to being able to go back by scrolling up with your mouse because something magical will happen (jk, just the quick menu disappearing). It's not something I can fix (I'll see what I can do next time) so just please don't use it too much or even at all. As an alternative, you can just click on the 'Back' or save at a menu choice. </li><li>If you find any other bug aside from the quick menu issue, please email me at <strong>niannn08@gmail.com</strong> with a screenshot of said bug.</li><li>Enjoy!\u00a0</li><li>I also post some TV-art in my twitter so you can go visit me there.

It's just one word, nothing crucial. So yeah, minimal update.</li><li>28/01/2018 - I finished proofreading and transferring it to rpy files so the VN should be okay now, grammar-wise\u00a0:D (I managed to fit it through the schedule, lol.
