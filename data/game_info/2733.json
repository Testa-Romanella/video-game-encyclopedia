{"id": 2733, "slug": "broforce", "name": "Broforce", "name_original": "Broforce", "description": "<p>Broforce is a parody run-and-gun game made in a 2D side-scrolling manner. Players are offered to take control of a Bro \u2013 one of the soldiers of the special Broforce unit. Actually, players are going to assume roles of several protagonists (all are Bros) while completing game levels. The main idea is to make a parody of fictional movie heroes of the 80s - 90s. During the levels Bros fight against terrorists in the setting of games of the 80s to rescue other Bros. The gameplay features special combat mechanics: each Bro has two different attacks (first is constant and endless, while the second requires recharging) and a melee weapon to climb the obstacles. However, enemies can be also defeated by using distracting maneuvers. Bros also have special abilities like parkour skill or explosion resistance. The level can be completed only if another Bro is rescued, terrorists with their boss are eliminated, and the American flag is set on the enemies\u2019 base. After each mission, the location explodes and Bros fly away by helicopter.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2015-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T19:40:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9cc/9cc11e2e81403186c7fa9c00c143d6e4.jpg", "website": "http://www.broforcegame.com", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 183, "owned": 4486, "beaten": 821, "toplay": 78, "dropped": 463, "playing": 71}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 1280, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1292, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Free Lives"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
