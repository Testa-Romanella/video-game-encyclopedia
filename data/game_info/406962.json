You enter the army training camp as a private on your first day and there is no time to be idle as you are put through your paces and a series of training challenges in order to graduate, ready for army action around the world!<br/><br/>Earn money as you progress through the army training in your base and then manage the expansion of your camp, where you upgrade the value, speed, capacity and queue sizes of all the training areas. It\u2019s going to be a rollercoaster ride, but with no room for lazy or idle cadets, you will love growing and upgrading your army base.<br/><br/>Here are some of the challenges you need to complete before you graduate:<br/><br/>EXERCISE YARD - get fit as you head to the Exercise Yard to get the heart-rate going with sit-ups, star jumps and more.<br/><br/>URBAN WARFARE - be alert as you go through SWAT training in house-to-house combat training. <br/><br/>JUNGLE WARFARE - get ready for an adventure in the jungle as you get out the chopper and idle around before you come down the rope into the jungle.<br/><br/>ARCTIC WARFARE - wrap up warm as you control your heartbeat, shelter from the snow fallout and aim straight in the arctic tundra.<br/><br/>HEAVY MACHINE GUN - hear the tap, tap, tap of heavy machine-gun fire as you train.<br/><br/>HEAVY ARTILLERY - boom, boom, boom - it\u2019s time for the big guns to unleash hell.<br/><br/>CHEMICAL WARFARE - put on your mask, breath carefully and watch your step and ensure you know your way around the misty gas.<br/><br/>TANKS - this is for the big boys (and girls), where you wheel your tanks to unleash the big guns to cause maximum damage. Big fallout!<br/><br/>DESERT WARFARE - it\u2019s hot, hot, hot and the sand is heavy. So you\u2019ll need to drive over the wooden planks. You\u2019re not racing here, but speed is fun!<br/><br/>NAVAL WARFARE - you might need to be a tycoon to afford a boat, but you need to have confidence on high seas, so get ready to get wet!<br/><br/>EXPLOSIVE TRAINING - pull the pin and throw for your life as the grenades fly and the explosions are big! <br/><br/>PARATROOPER - your evolution from a cadet will be needed as you free fall from your plane and land in the target zone. Tycoons need not apply!<br/><br/>OBSTACLE COURSE - a real adventure for you idle capitalists out there - you\u2019ve got the cargo net, monkey bars, muddy lake and rope climb - a true proof of your fitness.<br/><br/><br/>It\u2019s the best army idle game you\u2019ll find and we hope you enjoy the adventure, the action, the sense of progression and fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T01:54:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04fa4eefa6c91840d15ec125ef06d032_V6SIyfm.jpg", "website": "http://www.neonplay.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Neon Play"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Neon Play"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
