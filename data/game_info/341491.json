Players will love the stylized graphics and engaging narrative.\u00a0It tastes minty!</p>\r\nThe Story\r\n<p>A veteran of war and a anxious wanderer, Abigail is looking for a new life--and steady work--in the Gaz territory. Unfortunately, her timing seems to be less than perfect. She'll need to get help in order to reach her\u00a0goals. Taking a job for a local\u00a0wizard seems like an easy gig, but it might turn out to be more than she bargained for...</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Mint Flavored Fantasy is based on a number of JPRG's and features everything you'd expect from the genre, including an over-world map, turn-based battles, fully-animated characters and cutscenes, and much more!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keyboard: Walk = Arrow Keys, Accept = Ctrl, Cancel/Menu = Esc</p>\n<p>Xbox Controller: Walk = Left Stick, Accept = A, Cancel = B, Menu = X</p>\r\nOn Development\r\n<p>Mint Flavored Fantasy was made in Unity 3D in about two months. I'm a long time fan of RPGs, especially the old turn-based battle games, so I decided to build one as a personal challenge and as a chance to experience them in a new light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I learned a lot on this project and had to face many new challenges. I'm looking forward to using these new found skills on my next project and perhaps, time willing, I can develop my RPG system further.</p>\n<p>If you played Mint Flavored Fantasy please leave a comment below and tell me what you thought. Good or bad, I'd love to hear it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:18:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d4b5aedeea7d49d5b5a11257634257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brain Jar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
