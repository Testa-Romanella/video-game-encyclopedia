It's been a project that's been stopped and started so much, but I've made the resolution that I'm going to finish this. After the game that inspired me (Rimworld)\u00a0got a new DLC i've determined I'm going to finish this passion project.</p>\n<p>It's not perfect, it's just me, who is not a gamedev by trade, \u00a0learning this. I'm sinking all my passion into it and I'd be glad to accept any feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for helping make my dream a reality.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c7bd684ad42acbe4e2060cf8c2a4401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bwheatley"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
