The Player [you] must take out criminals, and escape the buildings alive. Use your Riot Shield and Flash Grenades to get through, and get to the extraction point.</strong></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p><strong>[A] and [D] to move left and right</strong></p><p><strong>[W] to jump</strong></p><p><strong>[S] to throw a grenade</strong></p><p><strong>[SPACE] to punch/hit with shield  </strong></p><p><strong>Features </strong></p><p><strong>- Walk over green cubes to get more health and grenades.</strong></p><p><strong>- Watch the time, and try to beat your best!</strong></p><p><strong>Bugs to note:</strong></p><p><strong>Please understand that this was made by a one-man-team in ~12 - 16 hours, so you might find a few more bugs than mentioned.</strong></p><p><strong>- No Sound on Resupply (don't worry, still works)</strong></p><p><strong>- Player looks forwards or backwards (just move left &amp; right to fix) </strong></p><p><strong>- No high score (I know this isn't a bug, but it couldn't be implemented due to a glitch found during development. Might add it in later, might not)  </strong></p><p><strong>How It Fits Ludum Dare 31's Theme (Entire Game On One Screen) </strong></p><p><strong>Obviously, themes are up to interpretation, so this is how I interpenetrated it. You see, there are three levels in the game, but all in/on the same scene/map. The camera does not change location's as well. Therefore, the entire game is played on 'one screen' which is the game camera. Hopefully that made sense. </strong></p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><strong>- Game created by 'Crawler`Games (me)</strong></p><p><strong>- Used Unity, Blender, GIMP, and Paint</strong></p><p><strong>- Made for Ludum Dare, 48 hour Compo</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/676/67679f13644436cb08638f1e9d008c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crawler Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
