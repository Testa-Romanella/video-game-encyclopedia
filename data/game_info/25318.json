Now moving to a rockabilly beat and able<br />\nto transform into nine different characters, Zonk lets loose through<br />\nseven action-packed stages in another battle against his archnemesis,<br />\nSandroVitch. Power up Zonk with the classic Meat item, eventually<br />\nturning him into the champion of justice, Ultra Zonk, or the fearsome<br />\nTyrano Zonk in the latter stages of the game. After rescuing his friends<br />\nfrom enemies, Zonk can also morph with them to combine powers. Fight<br />\nenemies with killer tunes belted out from a trusty microphone! Hurl<br />\nfreshly made sushi at them! With its variety of wacky attacks, Super Air<br />\nZonk has a sense of humor all its own.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
