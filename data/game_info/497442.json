This test, however, I should warn you, there are higher stakes going into this.</p>\n<p>For this experiment, you will be thrown into a simulation. This simulation is a re-creation of another test subject's memories, 7747's to be precise. While his memories are re-created here, the choices he made were not. You will have full control over what happens.</p>\n<p>Your job here is the same as last time. Complete the simulation, and you will be rewarded. Fail, and your life is forfeit. I know after last time this may seem like a lot at stake, but let me reassure you, the data that you collect will be astronomical to assisting what I have planned for the future.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to begin?</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Developers note: This is just a demo for now. Once the full game is ready to be released, this demo will be removed from the market.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a1b4f287e3015a1c740187953502b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevMyers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
