They kept searching for money forever because they did\r\nnot control expenses and let money make more money for them. They did not apply 3 types\r\nof income namely, active income, portfolio income and passive income together to build\r\nwealth. They did not know the important of cash flow management. They thought they traded\r\nwell but were not aware that the transaction cost was eating their profits. Those who invested\r\nwith no knowledge and right mindset are called Investor Zombies.
