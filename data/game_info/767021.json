Movement is only horizontal and vertical.\u00a0 After you have moved you player, you will enter the City Expansion phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Player\u00a0</strong><strong>Search</strong></p>\n<p>During the move phase, you will have an option to search the area when you\u00a0start a new turn on a card that is a Royal Card (Jack, Queen, King) or an Ace Card.\u00a0 The Royal Cards represent abandoned shops and contain weapons to assist you on your travels across the city.\u00a0 The Ace cards contain survivors that need rescuing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Royal Cards you will notice a box with a number on it, and with Aces, you will notice a survivor lying down with a number to the top right of them.\u00a0 These numbers indicate the the number of Action Points (APs) required to find the item or rescue the hostage.\u00a0\u00a0To search, just click the search button when available in the bottom right of the screen.\u00a0Note, if you choose to search you will not be able to move.\u00a0 Also, you can search up to 3 times within a turn, but if you use all your APs searching, you will not be able to attack zombies this turn.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>City Expansion</strong></p>\n<p>This phase requires your player to discover the neighbouring city blocks.\u00a0 This is done by drawing a card from the deck and placing it in one of the 3 empty spaces in the neighbouring column.\u00a0 Repeat this 2 more times until the neighbouring column has a card.</p>\n<p>Depending on where you place you card, will determine the number of zombies that will be spawned in the next phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Zombie, Item and Survivor discovery</strong></p>\n<p>During this phase, depending on the cards that have been placed in the city along with difference between the new card and its neighbouring card will determine the number of zombies spawned.</p>\n<p>For items that are discovered, they contain a random weapon and require number of action points listed on the box icon to find/unlock the item.\u00a0 Along with receiving the weapon you will also receive ammo.</p>\n<p>For survivors, the number in the top right of their character sprite indicates the number of action points required to rescue them.\u00a0 As a bonus for rescuing survivors, you will be rewarded with some health.</p>\n<p><strong>Zombie Move</strong></p>\n<p>Zombies will always try and hunt you down so each turn zombies move one city block closer to you unless they are in the same city block as you.</p>\n<p><strong>Player Attack</strong></p>\n<p>During this round you get one attack, and depending on the weapon you have available and selected will determine the number of zombies you can attack during this turn.\u00a0 There are 4 weapon types in the game, Baseball Bat, Pistol, Rifle and Shotgun.\u00a0 You will always have a bat available, but for the other weapons, you will need to find them.</p>\n<p><strong>Zombie Attack</strong></p>\n<p>If there is a zombie remaining in your city block after you have attacked them, then you will sustain damage. Actually, the number of zombies remaining within your city block (card) will determine how many health points you will lose.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For 1-5 zombies you will lose 1 health point, for 6-10 zombies you will lose 2 health points, for 11-15 you will lose 3 health points and so on.</p>\n<p>When using a pistol, rifle or shotgun each attack phase will use one ammo round.\u00a0 If you run out of ammo, then that weapon can no longer be used until you find more ammo.</p>\n<p><strong>Zombie Hordes</strong></p>\n<p>When a Joker is placed in the city, a Zombie Horde is released.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Over</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you lose all your health points it is game over and you lose the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Winning the Game</strong></p>\n<p>If you make it all the way across the city and survive a zombie attack you escape the city and win the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:54:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a4f2069bcc27cb5a2c9340364d68937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Neon Orbis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
