The idea was to have the player be a cat dodging enemies\u00a0with Brazilian houses in the background. See if you can reach the end of the level alive. Let me know what\u00a0you think in the comments section. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T04:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/464203a9150318836f3495c29ce1c0bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pokidrake"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
