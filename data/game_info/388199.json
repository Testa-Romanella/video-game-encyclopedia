This is my entry for the 'What a Mess' weekly game jam.</p>\n<p>The player has to click the + button to introduce predators in order to keep the insects under control, preventing them from devouring all of the foliage. Both the insects and predators follow rules:</p>\n<p><strong>INSECTS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The game will include habitat that insects will feed off</li><li>Feeding insects gain energy</li><li>Increased insect feeding will result in a shrinking landscape</li><li>Reduced insect feeding will result in an expanding landscape</li><li>Insects can only reproduce if they have sufficient energy</li><li>Insects die if energy levels reach zero</li></ul>\n<p><strong>PREDATORS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>One predator at a time will be introduced by the player</li><li>A maximum of three introductions at a time</li><li>Predators feed off insects to gain energy</li><li>Predators can only reproduce if they have sufficient energy</li><li>Predators die if energy levels reach zero</li></ul>\n<p>This was built over a weekend.
