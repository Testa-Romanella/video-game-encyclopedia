{"id": 606398, "slug": "boulder-world", "name": "Boulder World", "name_original": "Boulder World", "description": "<p>You play as a small rock thing that needs to defend his castle by launching boulders at the approaching enemy. You can do this by building a few turrets, but you only have so many boulders! Thus you need to leave the castle to retrieve the boulders you've launched to reload the turrets, while avoiding the enemy and your own flying boulders. Controls are in game, presented as a big chunk of text.</p>\n<p>It's a fairly simple game, there are a few things you can do to make it easier like getting the enemy to group up under an approaching boulder to kill multiple guys with one boulder, and you can get more boulders by mashing spacebar on the large rocks near the enemies spawn, but getting to a high wave\u00a0really just requires you to keep bringing boulders back from outside the wall.</p>\n<p>Quick note: The player controls\u00a0freeze if you press any of the arrow keys, this is something to do with which window item is focused and where keyboard input events are triggered, and I\u00a0don't quite know how to fix it. You can unfreeze it by clicking the menu button in the top left, but that obviously brings you back to the menu screen. (This was my first C# project, made in about a week. It's probably got more bugs than just\u00a0 this)</p>\n<p>(Caps lock enables a few extra buttons for testing purposes also. Can be fun)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T07:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb5f55a48cf3a79cf82108df9392410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nauviax"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
