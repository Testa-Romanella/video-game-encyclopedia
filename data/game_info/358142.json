Overlive's core gameplay is exploring the city and uncovering the story in the style of a \"choose your path\" interactive story gamebook. Survive by exploring 18 locations and finding one of 8 possible endings! <br/> <br/>+ There are 1000s of unique and professionally written events to encounter and even more tough decisions to make! All decisions have consequence; small decisions early in the game can have profound effects later! Meet other survivors and help or exploit them. Plenty of moral decisions will question how far you would go to survive and affect your final score... can you survive without losing yourself?<br/> <br/>+ Grow your character as you see fit! Train 9 different skills (melee, firearms, explosives, grappling, stealth, lockpicking, engineering, perception, computers) to overcome obstacles during exploration. Specialize or generalize, fight or bypass bosses, and use your skills to achieve the best ending! Be a stealthy computer hacker or a guns blazing pyromaniac \u2013 you decide! <br/><br/>+ You have a limited amount of time to escape your city before the nuclear plant goes into meltdown and destroys what remains of the city (including you)! Each day choose between exploring the city, training your skills, or resting. Learn from your mistakes and improve your survivability and score in subsequent playthroughs - this is a game that is meant to be replayed! <br/><br/>+ Defeat zombies, bosses, and other threats in real-time combat with hand to hand weapons, firearms, and explosives! Enemies come in all sizes and can come at you fast, attack from a range, tank you, or mob you in numbers! Change up your tactics to maximize your combat effectiveness and minimize the time you spend resting at home! <br/><br/>+ Memorable and fearsome bosses will stand in your way to freedom! But don't worry if combat isn't your thing - you can weaken or bypass them entirely using non-combat skills!  <br/><br/>+ Find dozens of items to boost your abilities including new weapons and survival gear! Even your home can be upgraded! <br/> <br/>+ Achieve the best possible score grade based on your actions, accomplishments, and moral conduct! Everything you do to survive is recorded and is factored into a detailed final score report and grade! 24 diverse achievements are available to be unlocked in the Game Center!<br/><br/>+ This FULL version is 100% free of ads and IAP - you get everything unlocked upfront!
