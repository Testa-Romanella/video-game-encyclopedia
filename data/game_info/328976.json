A Malaysian blog published an official image on August 30th, and they titled it \"RiverSide\".</p>\n\n<p>It would be a tourist hotspot for people visiting Malaysia from western countries, a little slice of home. However, a strand of newly-discovered disease was discovered on the island. Secluded from the modern world, the disease, now labeled \"Res-E\", was originally found in samples of small mammals and cross mutated to infect the human workforce on the island. This disease mimicked rabies as it caused a rapid inflammation of the brain. Only a handful of people were thought to be infected. Officials soon closed the island to be abandoned until further notice.</p>\n<p>2 years later.</p>\n<p>In September of 2008, a man by the name of Sal was sent to the island for animal testing to research the disease to determine its potency and means of spreading. A dog accompanied him for such tests, and Sal kept regular correspondence until communications suddenly ceased. Three days passed with no word from Sal and a small crew was dispatched to the island to investigate. Sal's phone was recovered outside one of the island's mansions and the crew reported two text messages sent to himself between 6-7 PM on the day of his disappearance:</p>\n<p>\"This is not what it seems.\" and \"This island cannot be inhabited.\"</p>\n<p>Sal's body was never recovered, but his dog was spotted scrambling near the shoreline. The crew described its movements as erratic and uncoordinated, and they captured it for further investigation. No new information was reported on the fate of the dog.</p>\n<p>3 months later.</p>\n<p>Low on funds and severely in debt, you are offered a job from the Malaysian government under the premise of a volunteer. Your tasks are assigned to you, and if completed, you are promised a handsome reward. The challenge has great risks, you're warned, and no help will come no matter the dangers you face.</p>\n<p>As you drive across the island, you soon realize all is not as it seems, as explosives rig behind you to trap you on the island and whatever destroyed the RiverSide.</p>\n<p>Story line written by: Warm Rain</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discordapp.com/invite/32aztAZ</p>\n<p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/OpendixStudios</p>\n<p>twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/OpendixStudios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T03:42:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bbae4737a096bb0cf7bbb33fb724508b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["opendixstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
