Some seemingly easy levels will have you completely stumped until you get a very satisfying 'Aha!' moment where you find the solution.<br/><br/>EXPERIENCE:<br/>After a short collection of tutorial levels, the game loads you immediately into an endless landscape of procedurally-generated puzzles that flow beautifully into each other upon solving. As you complete levels you will unlock three additional difficulty tiers that offer more challenging puzzles.<br/><br/>UI:<br/>The minimalistic UI distracts only with the essentials: the oft-needed reset and undo buttons, a convenient settings menu, and a puzzle-sharing button that lets you send level-codes to a friend.<br/><br/>We hope this game offers peaceful little moments when you need them most.<br/>Happy puzzling :)<br/><br/><br/>origin story: Jared randomly said \"duplicado\"... and thought we could make a fun game where you duplicate avocados. so we did.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T06:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d88af48e47fcdbbe96abadd598e098_Qc8Mp6U.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Brothers Make Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brothers Make Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
