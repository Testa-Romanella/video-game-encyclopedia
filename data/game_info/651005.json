Every night he must watch his study room to stop his tricksy artifacts from doing mayhem. One of those troublesome magical beings is you. And what do you love to do the most? Well juggle with your favourite extremely breakable crystal ball. As a matter of fact, that is the wizard's favourite crystal  ball. Well, to be honest it's his ONLY crystal ball. So try not to break it while you juggle it. Oh yeah, if the wizard hear your playful activities, you will quickly become not-existant. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTry and juggle as much as you can and earn as much points as you can. You can also give your friends a chance to beat your record. But don't give them to much. You don't want to be second on the leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T16:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/8910cf8f3425e4d208152eca438917a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narog Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Narog Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
