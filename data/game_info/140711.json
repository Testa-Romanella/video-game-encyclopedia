I used Unity Engine to program the game. For musics I used LinuxMultimediaStudio. For sounds effects I used Audacity and objects of my bedroom. For the first time, I have done graphics by myself using Inkscape, so it is not a very beautiful game ;). </p><p>Please, enjoy playing this game ! (feedback is very appreciated !)</p><p>Notes : On the web version of the game, fullscreen does not work on Chrome browser.</p><p>PS : I am searching a graphist and a game designer to make a game this year, contact me if you are interested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55edc50f1ed0973307d35aeab67bbb3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
