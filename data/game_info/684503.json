There are four different types of Possessions:\u00a0Heart, Mind,\u00a0Body, and Soul .</p>\n<p>For each type of Possession there is a cure item on the table. There is also an item on the table that causes a Whoopsie(they blow up).\u00a0Here's a handy dandy little breakdown of what each possession is cured by and what can cause a Whoopsie.</p>\n<p><strong>MIND</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Symptom:\u00a0Gibberish<br/>Cure:\u00a0Scroll<br/>Whoopsie: Dagger</p>\n<p><strong>BODY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Symptom: Poxed with green bubbles around head.<br/>Cure: Salve<br/>Whoopsie:\u00a0Scroll<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HEART</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Symptom:\u00a0Bleeding<br/>Cure: Dagger<br/>Whoopsie: Potion</p>\n<p><strong>SOUL</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Symptom: Smoking<br/>Cure: Potion<br/>Whoopsie:\u00a0Salve<br/></p>\n<p><strong>MULTI-POSSESSED CLIENTS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Some clients have multiple forms of possession and need to be cured in the correct order so they don't explode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FOR EXAMPLE: If a client is both Body and Soul possessed, they will be smoking and poxed. So to cure you will need to use the Potion first and then the Salve. If you use the Salve first, the client will explode because Salve + Soul Possession = Whoopsie.</p>\n<p><strong>INVERSION</strong></p>\n<p>On the third day, there is a possibility for cure/whoopsie inversion. When this happens, there is a blue glow around the client and the cures and whoopsie items for a Possession are reversed.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR EXAMPLE:\u00a0</strong> if a client is inversed and is Body/Soul Possessed (green bubbles and smoking)\u00a0the Inverted Cure would be to use a Scroll (Inverted Body Cure) and then the Salve (Inverted Soul Cure). If you used the Salve first in this case, it would cause a Whoopsie because that's the Inverted Whoopsie for Body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, this game is a lot of fun once you figure out how things work. I just didn't do a great job of explaining the system in game.<br/><br/>Definitely something I will update later.</p>\n\n<p>Can you perform an Exorcism under a time crunch?! Then you might just have what it takes to be an Express-orcist!\u00a0 But it isn't just the time and demonic possession you have to worry about; you also have to try and reach your daily quota!</p>\n<p>AND you have to worry about accidentally blowing up the possessed by botching the exorcism!\u00a0IT'S A\u00a0LOT OF PRESSURE!\u00a0</p>\n<p>See if you can excel and reach the top Express-orcist rank!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for the Scream Jam 2021!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTES TO\u00a0MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Days 1&amp;2 possessed will have no more than two types of possessions on them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- The order that you cure multi-possessed people is important so they don\u2019t \u2019splode.\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Day 3 introduces Inversions where if the possessed glow blue \u00a0then the things that cure them will \u2018splode them and the former \u2018splodey things will cure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- MAKE SURE TO READ THE BOOK OF EXORCISMS.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the mouse to move around.</p>\n<p>Left click to pick up/ interact with objects.</p>\n<p>Right click to throw any held items.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49ee7cf961b272d96d9fa4b0d10ade48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Pettigrew"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
