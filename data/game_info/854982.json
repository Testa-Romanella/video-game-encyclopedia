These stories won't all be romantic- plenty of them are going to be all about the action or drama, instead.</p>\n<p><strong>What this isn't:</strong></p>\n<p>Complete. There will be three episodes added (hopefully) every week.</p>\n<p>An archival project. Although it might be possible to recreate Lovestruck episodes in my game, it's not what I'm doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Important stuff!</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to open the game in ren'py's editor to mess with it, I\u00a0recommend downloading ren'py 7.5.3\u00a0 instead of ren'py 8.\u00a0 I made the game in 7.5.3, and have not tested it with ren'py 8.</p>\n<p>I have not and will not accept money for this project. It's up here for free, and donations are disabled.</p>\n<p>Please consider downloading this one on the itch app, since I\u00a0will be updating frequently, and it will save you from having to redownload the entire game every time I fix a typo or something.\u00a0New episodes will be added weekly.</p>\n<p>Check out the discord to follow along with development, report bugs and\u00a0make suggestions:\u00a0https://discord.gg/AVNjaXS82u</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T10:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7e/b7ed3cdf93bd196c9d97080438c32c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stolenoc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
