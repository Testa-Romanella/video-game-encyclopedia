In a world where Demonic beings seep into the Overworld and threaten humanity as a whole, who else can step in but those born, raised, and trained to combat these monsters.</p>\n<p>This is a 2D pixel art 1v1 Fighting Game, with mechanics akin to the Anime and Airdashers of the genre.\u00a0There are a few characters, and a\u00a0 couple of playable modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Versus - Play against another player (2P only)</li><li>Training - Practice the game's mechanics with another player (same as VS, but regeneration on the health)</li><li>Options - They don't work</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FIND THE CONTROLS AND GAMEPLAY BASICS IN THE SCREENSHOTS (video guide for mechanics and fighters coming soon)</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Lastly, I'd like to say Thanks for giving the build a try, and if you do, please leave some feedback, whether it be good or bad. I Worked on this project on an off for around 5 years, and throughout the last few months I pushed to get it decently playable. That being said, I know it's light on polish, especially the Character Select (something I plan on updating soon), There are known problems with the collision that i didn't get to solve, and there may be bugs and glitches (minor or major) present. Please let me know if you find anything in that regard.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T18:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/809/809be679e974671ba412a31e728019ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Torball"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
