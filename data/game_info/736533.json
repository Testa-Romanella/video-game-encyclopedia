It more than definitely will have bugs and exploits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What is this game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is all about gathering as much money as you can in the given time and make it back to the exit. You will face enemies or traps along the way so be careful. To gain money you can collect the NFTs you will find throughout the map and pick them up using E. E can also be used from grabbing the money that is in the vault.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To be able to finish you must have a minimum of $220,000 collected. This is shown through the cash counter changing colours.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer :\u00a0\u00a0The timer doesn't change seconds into minutes so speed run times are recorded in seconds overall. There is no official place for times so have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b238937e671e2f0414a7dd701ab9e95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1-bit"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
