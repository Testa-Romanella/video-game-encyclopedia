You will need to master timing your attacks, and spatial awareness if you don't want to be overrun by enemies.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Play as a lumberjack girl, and use your axe to chop tree stump monsters. Pick up maple syrup drops to restore health. Enjoy plaid and suspenders! Controls are standard WASD, with left control to attack. You will need to use precise timing and be facing the right direction to hit the enemies.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nContact:\r\n<p>Surprise!
