One such ninja, Kurenai, lives to avenge her father&#39;s death and will go to any means necessary to destroy the Black Lizard Clan. Kurenai is a master of the tetsugen, a wire weapon that can cut off an enemy&#39;s head or hang them from a tree, depending on the end attachments used and the length and strength of the weapon&#39;s wire. Aggressively employing such tactics as wearing disguises, using womanly wiles, and controlling Ninjutsu powers will help you to escape enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-11T10:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dc3/dc31d03869e80e93b7526c013c736679.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Vivendi Universal Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
