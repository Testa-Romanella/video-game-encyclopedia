Rings of a slime's color will appear to show that they're about to spawn and each slime has their own movement pattern\u00a0(identical to NecroDancer).\u00a0The more slimes you kill in one turn, the more points you earn for said turn. Killing enough slimes in a turn also grants you extra turns!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys - Move</p>\n<p>Z - Spell 1</p>\n<p>X - Spell 2</p>\n\n<p>Spells:</p>\n<p>Fireball - Kills all slimes that are horizontal to you</p>\n<p>Pulse - Kills all slimes\u00a0in an X-shape (i.e. up-left, up-right, down-right, and down-left from your position, all by 2 tiles)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bomb - Plants a bomb that explodes in 3 turns after you place it; Explosion radius is 3x3 (with bomb placement being the center) and kills all enemies inside while dealing 2 damage to you if you're in the radius\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heal - Heals 0.5 HP and grants 2 turns of invulnerability from all damage (including the turn you use this spell), max HP is 3</p>\n\n<p>Other Tidbits:</p>\n<p>Invulnerability is indicated by your character\u00a0flashing, quicker flashing means you'll lose invulnerability on the next turn.</p>\n<p>If you ever take damage from an enemy or a bomb, you'll receive 2 turns of invulnerability (including the turn the damage occurs).</p>\n<p>Standing on an incoming slime spot will deal 0.5 damage for every turn you're\u00a0on it, invulnerability isn't granted from this kind of damage.</p>\n\n<p>I may toy around with the values more but\u00a0 for anyone that's curious,\u00a0the score/turn increment tables are currently the following:\r\n</p>\r\nSlimes Killed (in one turn)\r\nPoints\r\nTurns\r\n1\r\n+1\r\n+0\r\n2\r\n+3\r\n+0\r\n3\r\n+6\r\n+1\r\n4\r\n+10\r\n+2\r\n5\r\n+15\r\n+3\r\n6\r\n+21\r\n+4\r\n7\r\n+28\r\n+4\r\n8\r\n+36\r\n+5\r\n9\r\n+45\r\n+5\r\n10\r\n+55\r\n+5\r\n11\r\n+66\r\n+6\r\n12\r\n+78\r\n+6\r\n13\r\n+91\r\n+7\r\n14\r\n+105\r\n+7\r\n15\r\n+120\r\n+8", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d633469fd4d3b70b4d7b7385c5c85665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Notester82"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
