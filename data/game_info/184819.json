There are also some boosts lying around which will make you faster for a short amount of time. Because you can shoot at others, they also can shoot you. So there are shields which protect you from getting shot and killed.</p>\n\n<p>You also don't want to get off the track because the floor is lava and it will reset all of your scores, and so you won't win, and you want to win!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main concept of this game is pretty simple: you drive around, pick up weapons (or a shield) and boost and try to get the best lap and the highest score.</p>\n<p>This game is also a multiplayer only game. You join with 3 others in a lobby and just play!<br/>The name is a combination of Ca(r) and (Shoo)ter which is totally creative!</p>\n<p>btw. this game is totally unpolished</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b336c1e903633e78d5c6e101704418a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["dwarfmeat"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
