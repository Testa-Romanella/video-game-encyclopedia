There\u2019s also an asteroid bonus level where you can break up asteroids for points, and break up bigger asteroids for power-ups, including bonus shields, extra lives, score multiplier, and a faster fire rate. <br/><br/>HINTS: <br/>\u2022\u00a0Vector-Z\u2019s ship holds 2 missiles. One fires from each wing, so there\u2019s a slight offset. There is also a brief reload time.<br/>\u2022 Aliens are worth more points when they are attacking you. Even more points when they are really close!<br/>\u2022 Go for the bonus points from accuracy: at 50% you get 100 pts per hit, 200 pts at 75%, 400 pts at 90%, and 800 bonus pts per hit with 100% accuracy! <br/>\u2022 Aim for the bigger asteroids to collect hexagonal power-ups", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d9b3ae090f9e09a6c9ec71ba3e1e069.jpg", "website": "http://vector-z.juggleware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Juggleware"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Juggleware"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
