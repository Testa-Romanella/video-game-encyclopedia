I also do not have enough knowledge of how the Sinden lightgun works. <br/>If you want to test a Lightgun and report in the comments about it, <br/>you are welcome to do so.<br/> I will try to find out more information about Lightguns.</p>\n<p>The game itself is simple. You are in a forest at night, <br/>and an endless horde of evil Spirits attacks you. <br/>You have to shoot the spirits before<br/>they can reach you and hurt you.</p>\n<p>If your health drops to zero, the game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T08:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b6d2e709c07c1982a6316987310f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Primal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
