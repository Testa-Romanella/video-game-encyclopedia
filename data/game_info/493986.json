Sounds really dumb now that I am done with this project.</p>\n<p>Game-play:<br/><br/>///The faster you are moving the stronger your abilities\\\\\\<br/><br/>-If you REALLY have to play the WebGl avoid using the burning dude.</p>\n<p>-During build phase place down \"towers\" which are your playable characters.-Hold shift to place multiple towers.<br/>-When you are not building you can take control of your character by right-clicking them and will be taken to a third-person camera.<br/>-Control your character with WASD keys, Shift is dash and Space is Jump. Shift and Dash cost you \"Honour\" which is your limited resource.\u00a0<br/>-Left click to commit suicide. The faster you are moving in the moment of suicide the more debilitating the effects will be.<br/></p>\n<p>-During death cam you can press \"Space\" to skip.<br/></p>\n<p>-You can press \"R\" at anytime to restart the game.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you like it, I'll try to fix it according to feedback after the Jam is over if people enjoy it.<br/><br/>-Let me know if you like my tree shader?\u00a0<br/><br/>-Sorry for the horrible UI. :)<br/><br/>-Please lots of feedback.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Exanite and SteveSmith from UDC discord for always helping me out in the \"Help\" chat for the last few months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db631915a7b9409e0fe940c69df5e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Blue94"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
