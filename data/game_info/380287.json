Make it to the goal without touching any objects.</p>\n<p>PS: Really sorry about the music compression and some of the bugs such as the cars not moving after the lights turn green for them. I tried very hard to fix all of that, but I'm a beginner to game development, and the deadline loomed too near.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T08:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e548af35d8d3303fb33e7341928d756b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cathulhu Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
