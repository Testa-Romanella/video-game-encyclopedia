It's being made in RPG Maker 2000 and is currently in very early development. This is basically just here because I felt like showing what I have done. Everything except the terrain is RPG Maker's built-in assets right now but I'm going to make the rest too, hopefully.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4842d9ce65fe186fa30204813e7a1848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Debleb"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
