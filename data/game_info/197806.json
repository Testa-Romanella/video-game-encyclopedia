Neither can win without the other, yet ultimately only one pig can escape the island. We wanted to see how that tension between cooperation and competition plays out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We did not even remotely come close to beginning to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Instead we have two pigs, stranded on an island, trying to shoot each other into either drowning or falling into lava.</p>\n<p>We tried a lot of new things on this project. That was probably our biggest mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Keys:</p>\n<p>Pink Pig Player 1:\u00a0WASD and V to fire</p>\n<p>Purple Pig Player 2:\u00a0Arrow keys and numpad 0 to fire</p>\n<p>Note: it turns out most keyboards won't even let you press all these keys at once. So, try to cooperate?</p>\n<p>Credits: \u00a0Tor, Maff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f286b13936914d41dad6ba4f730deb99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MaffGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
