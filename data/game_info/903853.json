It was a sad but beautiful time. We lived our normal lives but with the knowledge that things were going to end.</p>\n<p>This is a story of a queer romance with a definite end in sight, of two people who still love each other very much, but can't be together. And the normalcy that's still possible under those circumstances.</p>\n<p>Potential trigger warnings include positive marijuana mention and portrayal of a panic attack.</p>\n<p>This was our entry for the Winter Visual Novel Jam 2022. Thank you so much to the people who helped, Gemmy System, Henri Tikkala, Alexis Vandom, and Lily Yasuda!</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to writing more in the future.</p>\n<p>- Maya Zimmerman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T14:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/570a70e9180f67ac7eb00bffd43a6310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["easypeazygames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
