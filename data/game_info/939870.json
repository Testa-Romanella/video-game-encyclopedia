{"id": 939870, "slug": "blood-favor", "name": "Blood Favor", "name_original": "Blood Favor", "description": "<p>Blood Favor is a first-person shooter roguelike set in a dystopian world where entertainment is king. You are one of many desperate individuals willing to risk it all, and lucky you, you've been selected to compete! Are you here for justice? Revenge? Change? Whatever it is, you better put on a good show. <strong>Your life Depends on it.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>An ambitious VGDev title, this game includes what you'd expect in a standard FPS with First person movement and 5 unique weapons, as well as intelligent AI that shoot at you, take cover, and charge at you! All of this combat takes place in the gameshow setting, which must be different every time to keep the audience engaged, so Blood Favor also has a robust 3D level generator that puts handmade rooms together at runtime to make a unique layout for each playthrough! Earn tickets by performing well in one of the many (2) games, and spend those tickets on items in the shop. You can also find free items in mystery gifts around!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Please note this is only a short demo, and the game is missing many planned features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T04:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/68947f1a65d66504139145783fefc6c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jroo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
