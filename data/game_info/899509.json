It was designed to use as many addictive tactics that mobile game developers that I could fit into such a simple game that has no online functionality. Here is the list of said tactics: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>continue with ads (yes, there are ads, but they are the default Unity test ads so I don't really make any money)</li><li>highscores (people like it when numbers go up, and they really like it when numbers go higher than their previous number!)</li><li>collectables (a shop with skins! people like collecting things so therefore they will spend more time to get said collectables)</li><li>scaling gameplay (people will more likely continue because they know that the beginning of the game is slower than the later parts, where you can get more score and coins)</li></ul>\n<p>This game is not really well optimized (it reads a file ~500times/s), nor very well coded, but it was made mostly as a proof of example to show that these tactics do not take long to implement in such a small game, and there are multiple at play in such simple gameplay (but still took me way too long as this is the first Unity game I've ever made).<br/></p>\n\n<p>how to play:\u00a0</p>\n<p>tap the screen to flip the paddle, the color that is facing up should be the same as the falling ball. if you do that, you're good!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T14:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b457604e8d27c4c884c940c0ec2bb5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["po-ly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
