Luckily time-wise very generous (9 days &amp; theme announced a day prior). First 4 days all about approaching Game Maker (previously only known by name) by the means of tutorials, reddit threads, and that manual. Well, what a wild ride these 9 days turned out to be.<br/></p>\n<p>When it comes to the theme \u201cCONNECTION\u201d\u00a0itself that went kinda like that: I thought of the word sharing its first latter with my YT channel name. As the C in my profile picture reminded me of some kind of token, I wondered if I could put that to some use. Yeah, lets start the game with only that. Then\u00a0WORDLE came to mind \u2013 a game I. And it went on.<br/></p>\n<p>Yeah, I have not slept in over 32h, sorry. I kinda hope I can still edit this texbox after submitting the game (how very thrilling\u2026). Here are some basic facts to close my word salad for now:</p>\n<ol><li>Player (you?!) has to guess a 5-letter word in a rather convoluted manner.</li><li>Guessing the workings is basically half the fun. The other is being stressed out a little, I guess.</li><li>Please also note, that there are always at least 2 correct solutions. These are guaranteed. All these words are pulled from the \u201cofficial\u201d WORDLE list of 5-letter words, but checked with a much larger collection to hopefully address whatever esoteric word you discovered.</li><li>PRO-TIP: Each portal has a different way to activate.</li><li>Fun-fact: press F1 to see the laughable stump of a help-system I was just about to set up.</li><li>Don\u2019t get stressed.</li><li>It\u2019s solvable. I won a few times.</li></ol>\n<p>LEVELS</p>\n<p>This version comprises exactly one semi-generated level. Several lovely elements didn\u2019t make it into this version (way more variety with the music, some in-game assistance, more mechanics, and stuff), due to aabsolutely-no-frickin\u2019-time-left. HOWEVER I have actual plans to rework this into something more approachable. Sorry, I can barely form words right now (zzzzzz\u2026). Take care, everyone!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25cddf78269efaf5df7d8f7fb6332455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clapostrophe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
