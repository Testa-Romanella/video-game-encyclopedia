There are various ways to increase their stats:\r\n</p>\n<p>'Specials' affect either the plant itself or plants around it, and give a wide range of bonuses, so the goal is to place them in a good setup to maximise the bonuses you get, and also combo them: e.g. placing plants that give crit chance to a plant with high crit multi.\r\n</p>\n<p>Different specials can be combined in infinite combinations by fusing them, though it's time consuming and risky.\u00a0My goal is to have enough variety in the kinds of specials that people theory-craft which ones to fuse and make different builds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The base stats of plants can be boosted via infusion and ranks, there will definitely be more ways in the future as well.\r\n</p>\r\nContent &amp; feedback\r\n<p>I wouldn't say the game is in early development, but it's definitely nowhere near finished. There is placeholder art and in some cases no art, and there are only 15 plants at the moment and not that many upgrades, but all the base systems to make a game are there. I feel like it's missing something and I want more people to play it so I can have a better idea of what that is and get some ideas from people.</p>\n<p>I'm not a UX/UI designer so it probably looks a bit wonky.</p>\r\nPlanned content\r\n<p>More plants obviously. I can add more very easily I just want to get an idea of where to take the game first.\r\n</p>\n<p>More ways to get plants rather than just leveling, exactly how I'm not sure yet but having plants that are only obtainable through certain methods would be cool, forcing you to invest into different systems.</p>\n<p>More prestige upgrades\r\n</p>\n<p>More chip stats</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6abc6c6bfcf7d426cbd92dbde7b0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["snowtackt"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
