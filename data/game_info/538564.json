You need a Koala while the London Zoo needs a Brown Bear.\u00a0 What a coincidence you have a Brown Bear and the London Zoo has Koala. You shake hands and exchange animals. But what if you don't have a Brown Bear...<br/><br/><br/><br/>You're the zoo manager and head of the Zoo's exchange program. For various reasons you need animals and there are zoos which also want to exchange some of their animals. Find exchange chains, where you exchange with several other zoos only to exchange for animals you wanted in a first place. Animals are your currency. Build good relations with other zoos to exchange more animals or to exchange animals on your terms. Upgrade your zoo to increase capacity or to unlock new types of animals. Breed your unique animals to exchange them later and compete for the title of #1 zoo.</p>\r\nLove Animals and Strategy Games?\r\n<p>stay in the know on all the latest in development</p>\n\n<p>Developed by Curious Foxes and published by Crytivo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a9831389b3829ccebe4bb1842a36707e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crytivo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
