The Japanese have withdrawn after the Allied victory and British forces regain control of the region, however when a small armoured column goes silent, a young lieutenant is sent on one last mission to find out what happened. Upon his arrival he is faced with horrors beyond that of the World War, will you be able to overcome them?<br/>The Falling Sun provides a gripping story in a refreshing environment all the while keeping you on edge around every corner. The atmosphere will keep you on your toes, keep a keen ear and don\u2019t always rely on your weapon to get you out of harm\u2019s way.<br/>With a series of acts you can immerse yourself in the game\u2019s story through campaign mode; or even face the onslaught of horror in survival. Whatever you choose to do, keep your wits sharp. The game currently ships with two acts and a survival mode but further installments will be added without additional cost from the standard game price.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-27T20:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e3e78f425ea902ee0e4d9bca0159e1a.jpg", "website": "http://www.loneplanetstudios.com", "rating": 1.73, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 362, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LonePlanetStudios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["GrabTheGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
