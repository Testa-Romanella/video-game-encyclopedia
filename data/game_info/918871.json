Users can play with 21 pitch blocks to build their own chords, or play a musical piece in Db major. <br/><br/>Yellow pitch blocks can be hovered to play their respective pitch, activated to sustain a pitch while not hovering, or turned on in a chord set via the white chord button. The red \"Stop\" button cuts all sound and deactivates all currently activated blocks.<br/><br/><strong>Use Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Touch any yellow block to play a pitch.<br/>- Click trigger button while hovering on a pitch to toggle its sustain.<br/>- Click trigger button while hovering on any white button to toggle a full chord.<br/>- Click trigger button while hovering on Red button to stop playing all sounds.<br/><br/>The arrangement of pitches is (left to right from furthest row to closest row):</p>\n<p>\u00a0F - Gb - Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb<br/>C - Db - Eb - F - Gb - Ab - Bb<br/>Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - Gb</p>\n<p><strong>Asset information:<br/></strong>Skybox - Unity Asset Store<br/>Stone Textures - Unity Asset Store<br/>Vocal Hum Sample - Freesound.org<br/>GUI Box - Unity Asset Store<br/>Cover Image Font - Dafont.com</p>\n<p>All other assets created by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T13:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad2/ad2157a91e4eb90cd8b5cf649a5ec1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrabRabbit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
