I stayed true to that as I only used assets I created during the Jam. That not only includes the coding, but the sound effects, music, ideation, everything. I started with literally nothing and now have a game. Which I like :)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"deeper and deeper.\" I figured there would be a lot of games about digging or deep sea diving, and I wanted to be original. So I started thinking of other meanings of the word \"deep.\" Initially, I was thinking of making some sort of philosophy game about Plato or something. Like, \"wow man, that's deep.\" But I struggled thinking of a fun mechanic with game about ancient greek philosophers..</p>\n<p>So I decided to go with deep colors. The deeper the colors get in the game, the farther you progress. Mostly. I figured it would be fun to have each level be one color, then the player strives to make the level as a whole a <strong>deeper and deeper shade</strong> of that color. To further drive home the theme, I made every level progress\u00a0<em>downwards.</em></p>\n<p>I honestly wasn't sure if I'd have time for this Jam. We just got our 2nd does of the covid vaccine, and while I feel just fine, my wife is down for the count. So I got to full-time dad this weekend. After the kids went to bed, I worked on this game. So I only get two nights to work on this, starting at 8:00p. So I've probably cumulatively put in less than 10 hours on this game. Probably the most efficient I've ever been with any game jam game...</p>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>Per Ludum Dare tradition, I'm hosting all of my code and assets for this game here:</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15E44cYbCblUUyWQPGcNr6wErXrP1Lbrx?usp=sha...<br/></p>\r\nJam Highlights\r\n<p>I had a lot of fun over the past couple nights making this game.
