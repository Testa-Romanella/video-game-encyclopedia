The restriction was \"One Button\", and it was a fun restriction to work around!</p>\r\nDescription &amp; Thoughts\r\n<p>Alright, it's finally done! I had a lot of fun with this but it also gave me a headache, I'm too much of a goblin to focus to long on these. I made this in 72 hours, since yeah, of course, I'm late to the jam\u00a0<em>again</em>, and I\u00a0had to rush,\u00a0but this was still really fun!</p>\n<p>I think this is the first time I make music for a game in a while, and definitely the first time I\u00a0had time to make music for my game in a game jam!\u00a0This is also the third jam I've ever joined, and I'm still a little anxious about everything, I really hope I'm doing this right. : '3x</p>\n<p>I also wanted to make\u00a0a little \"shop\" where you could buy hats for the cat with points and such, but I ended up not having enough time and the one button restriction also made that tricky to think about, I still have no idea how I could make it work. I think I'll add it after the jam though, if I have the inspiration to do so!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, the 'meow'-esque sound in the music is a synth, which I absolutely adore. That's what synth plugins are for: cat sounds.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry if you find any bugs, I tried hard to fix all of them but I'm sorry in advance if you come across any bugs I didn't notice!</p>\n<p>I wish I could've added more difficulty, but I ran out of time to do so.\u00a0 :c I'm definitely considering doing so after the jam is over though!</p>\n<p>Also, the game saves your highscore in the browser's web storage by default, which is a fun new thing I've always wanted to implement in a game and I finally had the time to do so this time around!\u00a0I'm sorry if there are any glitches with that though!</p>\n<p>I think\u00a0<em>all</em> of my games have to include cats at this point. They\u00a0<em>have</em> to.
