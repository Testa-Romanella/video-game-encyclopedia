As he travels through the CPU, help him recover his memories and destroy the different enemy types sent to hunt him. But be careful, the further Vektor gets, the more devious the CPU becomes!  <br/><br/>There is a whole world to uncover within your CPU! Hiding away are 150 levels (nodes), 27 worlds (zones) and 4 unique abilities to unlock and upgrade. With Vektor providing you with Detonate to destroy enemies, Boost and Super Boost to out run them and Boostenate to smash your way through, you are sure to be able to help him escape!<br/><br/>Online leaderboards allow you to compete against your friends, those in your location and those closest to you in score. Use wildcards to double your score in each level and boost your standing in the leaderboards!<br/><br/>Some functions and features may not be available on PlayStation TV.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1 player(s)<br/>Network Features<br/>2048KB Minimum<br/>Touchscreen<br/>Location Data Acquisition Service<br/>Motion Sensor<br/><br/>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com/support/useragreements.
