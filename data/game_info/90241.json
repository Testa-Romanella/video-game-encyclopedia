Kikka works\r\n as an official guard for one of the many tiny villages in the region. \r\nHer most recent assignment is to travel with fellow guard Bemelle to an \r\nallied town that\u2019s been under siege by raiders.</p>\n<p>With an \r\never-present sense of urgency, the two find themselves on the shore of \r\nSinnlos, a cursed lake of black water that is home to the Nixi; twisted \r\ncreatures who take joy in drowning humans. The two need the assistance \r\nof a nameless guide to even attempt to cross the maze of bridges \r\nspanning the dark waters. But they are not the only ones seeking passage\r\n that night. The guide agrees to lead them all, whilst also giving a \r\nwarning that a group this large has no chance of making it across whole.\r\n Someone will be lost along the way. None of them volunteer to stay \r\nbehind, regardless. And so the ill-fated journey over the lake of voices\r\n begins.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for checking this out!
