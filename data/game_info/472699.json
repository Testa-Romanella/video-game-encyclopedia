Your job is to guide it to every lab on the planet while keeping it safe from anything that the liquid may negatively react to.<br/><br/>In the process of getting the water out of the area they were also conducting research on the water and discovered that the liquid possesses unique qualities such as the ability to move perpetually and the potential to fly (float) when influenced. They also discovered that the substance responds negatively to physical interference.</p>\n<p>Made for My First Game Jam Summer 2020<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This game is not finished and was slightly rushed to meet the jam deadline and as a result we were unable to balance or test the game and get all the feature we wanted in and there may be bugs.
