The door to the temple is locked. That must be where the answers are. To gain access, he pieces together a torn-up note scattered around the village which contains the combination to and whereabouts of the temple key.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>As the player, you must search around the village with Edmund's scanner to find four torn pieces of a note. Once the note pieces have been gathered, it will tell you where to find the key and provide a hint as to the combination of the locks securing it.  You can head up to the temple and open the doors to progress with the key obtained.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>WASD - Move<br/>C - Scan<br/>F - Interact<br/>E - Pick-up/Read Note<br/>Q - Toggle Cursor visibility<br/><br/><strong>The Project<br/></strong>I was tasked with developing a single 3D game level from scratch in Unity for my University module.</p><p> Initially, I developed the environment and menu which took about two months along with all of the graphics. <br/></p><p>Then I spent another two months developing the gameplay mechanics. These included the character movement, scanning mechanic, lock mechanic, interaction systems for picking up objects, camera changing, minimap and triggering events.</p><p>There were two character models that I developed for this, being the protagonist and the antagonist. These took about 6 weeks to model and custom rig. The protagonist which you control uses animations and a rig from Mixamo in the gameplay however the model used during the cinematic cutscene sequence I made at the end of the game used a custom rig for both characters. The animations used there are a mix of Mixamo and personal motion capture. <br/></p><p><strong>Bugs</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Sometimes the cursor is invisible when it shouldn't be. Click Q to toggle it on.</li><li>Scanning sometimes does not trigger the notes to appear, potentially confusing the player. You may need to repeatedly scan in the same area a few times.</li><li>Players may get stuck in certain areas of the environment.</li><li>Visual bug related to shadows on the character model as well as invisible mesh.</li><li>Visual bug with windows behind trees.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T12:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba9fe75c9c3331f3c40f216b73e8a1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrandonN"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
