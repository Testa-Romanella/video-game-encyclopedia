If you want to play the full one, download the game below.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Use space or click the screen to change gravity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer's note:</strong> This is my first ever indie game. My intention was to make a small, yet entertaining game, and I believe I made that work, although it could definitely\u00a0be better. Also, for a reason I\u00a0do not know, Windows' firewall and anti-viruses could detect this game as a virus, however, that is not true and it's completely free of any malware. If you do not trust me, you can still try the web version.</p>\n<p>Credits are reserved to Abstraction and Kenny for some of the music and sprites shown in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T10:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/551664c8ae34997d48f217db4761a5f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["KeriDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
