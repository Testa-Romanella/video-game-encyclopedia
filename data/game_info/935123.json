In this version you can play as Gabriel Strefezza, a footballer from my favorite soccer team, Lecce, which plays in the Italian Serie A league. Try to beat\u00a0 the Lecce goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone and score goals in the Via del Mare stadium in Lecce.<br/>The goalkeeper AI predicts the trajectory of the ball and tries to catch it. The game has realistic physics and realistic real-time sun position based on latitude and longitude\u00a0of the\u00a0stadium.</p>\n<p>Interactive Cloth Physics by Obi -&gt; https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/obi-cloth-81333</p>\n<p>Animations by mixamo and Super Goalie -&gt; https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/super-goalie-basic-144535</p>\n<p>Note that this is my first unity game made in few weeks using a low-end notebook.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently my goal for this game is to make it very similar to the EA Sports FIFA arena, with the ability to take free kicks and penalties.
