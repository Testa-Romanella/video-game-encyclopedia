On top of that, the theme was to base your game on a Twitter bot, and who better other than the grandfather of all nonsense, @horse_ebooks?\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Let us not forget that before @horse_ebooks was revealed to have been purchased and manually run by two artists, it was a genuine ebook-hawking .... sort of.... Twitter bot. I'm pretty sure the revelation that @horse_ebooks wasn't a real bot marks the turning point of the darkest timeline.)<br/></p>\n<p>So yeah, this was a fun little time, I had some laughs, I hope you do too. Wander a little horse farm and bump into horses to learn their gibberish wisdom. When you're done, the exit's in the northeast.</p>\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Cottages\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/771d74a1891b22034accf5df38067eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stoppableforce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
