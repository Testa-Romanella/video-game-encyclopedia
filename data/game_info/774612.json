Left click while on the ground to hit the ball and right click to boost while in mid air. You can also restart the level with escape if you get stuck. Have fun :)<br/><br/></p>\n<p> I only used the last day of the jam so everything was pretty rushed, <strong><em>the collisions don't even work properly and you bounce really weirdly when you hit the ground sometimes</em></strong>. I also didn't even have time to properly test some of the levels but at least the game is playable. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T23:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418820e9811daa9125f54d3d562d8501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Edgar Mendoza"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
