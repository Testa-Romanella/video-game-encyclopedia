If nothing is happening once you start the game and start clicking, just give it a minute or so to finish loading.\u00a0Press the left mouse button to progress the story and speed up text.

Press space again to bring it back. If the game is bigger than your screen dimensions, either zoom out your screen, or there is a \"full screen\" button to the bottom right.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-This round has a plenty of swearing, violence, and upsetting scenarios. Not for kids!\r\n</p>\n<p>-There are a LOT of cameos on this, but I got permission from their creators to use all of them. Trust me on this.</p>\n<p>-Crest is by ScrapPaper22 on Twitter.
