Think of an everyday object and it will guess what you are thinking. It can read your mind! It's a game similar to 20 Questions (or Animal, Vegetable, Mineral) that attempts to ask you questions to work out an object you are thinking about. You can think of everyday items (animals, household objects, food, quite a bit of other stuff etc) and it has 30 questions to try and guess the item. Have a try and see if it guesses what you're thinking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/39625e17b4b2a1d780c9f0a9e45cda95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["incredicat"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
