Just download the game and play it - <strong>you can play any <em>osu! </em>map you already have on your computer</strong>, or play the default maps.<br/><br/><em>Newest public build: 0.1.5 - Be sure to always stay updated!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>As of now, shoot the beat! is officially on alpha stage - this is the first available public build, which means some features are still being developed, so we will need your feedback and support to improve and keep going strong. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>We want to keep putting countless hours into the project like we have been doing for the past three months, but it's getting hard with work and college projects. That said, your support and feedback will determine how far we go - this is a community, after all :) If you wish to support the game, you can do so at Patreon! This is completely optional, but it would indeed mean a lot to us. We are a team of only 2 people, with jobs and responsibilities who are sacrificing a lot to work on this project.<br/></p>\n<p>Additionally, consider supporting and playing the awesome game that inspired us, osu! - without it shoot the beat! would obviously never have been a thing!<br/><br/>New!
