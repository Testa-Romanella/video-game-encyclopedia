This is the COMMANDER speaking. It\u2019s been 10 years since the demons have fully integrated into society after emigrating to our planet Earth. The problem is now, they are most likely scheming another invasion to Earth in secret, or something worse... and this is only known by demonkind, from the hotdog stand demonskins to the demon senators. You are an anonymous US marine sent to investigate the case, at the Union Demonkind Organization (UDO), see what they\u2019re up to, especially their chief in charge, EL DIABLO. If any opposition comes, leave no\u00a0survivors. Good luck, and godspeed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T03:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/5760e796b517debfc797510e3ffefde5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JMAAGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
