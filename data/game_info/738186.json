The game was praised for its graphics, sound, difficulty, and arcade-style gameplay. In 2010, Retro Gamer called Wizards &amp; Warriors &quot;a unique experience for NES gamers in 1987&quot; that was &quot;technically well ahead of other games for the console at the time&quot;, but attributed the game&#39;s relatively low difficulty to allowing unlimited continues without penalty. Wizards &amp; Warriors was followed by three sequels: Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors II (1989), Wizards &amp; Warriors X: The Fortress of Fear (1990), and Wizards &amp; Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power (1992).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T15:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f27c1727e695f9e01c5b8a46bbbbf1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment", "Jaleco", "NA/EU"], "esrb_rating": null}
