To scilence all who dared to doubt you,\u00a0 you have accepted a grand challenge. You will fight yourselves through an endless amount of enemies while trying to stay alive. The twist: The two of you are chained together the whole time.\u00a0</p>\r\nTutorial\r\n<p>There is a small tutorial in-game but here is a quick rundown:</p>\n<p>The Blue player is controlled with the arrow keys and can dash with the right control key. They fire on Numpad 3.</p>\n<p>The Red player is controlled with WASD and can dash with the left shift key. They fire on Space.</p>\n\n<p>There are three different types of Upgrades, one of which will be rewarded after every round.</p>\n<p>The first is the whiskey bottle. It grants a huge amount of health to the players.</p>\n<p>The second is the ammo upgrade. This allows for more shots to be fired before the players have to reload.</p>\n<p>The third is the barrel upgrade. This increases the firing rate of the players.</p>\n<p>That's all there is to know so get out there and prove your places as the best sheriffs those fools have ever seen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51c/51c58f679b61b5cc0889965a408a9d39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gymnier"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
