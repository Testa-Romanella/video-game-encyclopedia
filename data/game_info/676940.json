Your job is to help Gun Nose get from point A, to point B, without getting arrested for murder of cute critters!</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p>- Simple Two-Button Interface (Mouse click/touch screen, A/D, Left/Right arrow keys, 'Enter' on menu buttons)</p>\n<p>- Mobile Friendly</p>\n<p>- Should Work on All OSs and Devices (some exceptions may occur)</p>\n<p>- Colorblind Friendly? (unconfirmed, but screenshots look good on all settings of the colorblind simulator I use)</p>\n<p><strong>BUG FIXES</strong></p><p>10/6/2021</p><p>Fix 3:</p><ul><li>Changed end state script to call the correct high score variable rather than labeling your current score as the high score.\u00a0Result: User will now know the actual value of their high scores each run. Previous versions remain up for download.</li></ul><p>10/5/2021<br/></p>\n<p>Fix 2:</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed bug where button functionality wasn't fully working when buttons were clicked/tapped on but did work with keyboard controls.\u00a0Result: Game is now actually playable on mobile, and it is no longer possible to cheese a win by holding \"left\" with the mouse/touchscreen. Previous two versions remain up for download.</li></ul>\n<p>Fix 1:</p>\n<ul><li>Changed calculation resulting in strange behaviors (meter freezing, not shooting).\u00a0 Result: Game now feels more balanced due to calculation change. Broken version at launch will be left as downloadable.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Added threshold for sneeze value due to tween calculation not reaching full value sometimes. Result: Meter should no longer freeze when full.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Godot</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Paint.net</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Font: Emoticomic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2e58763efc676f5cb3354a19465f91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["papabirb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
