How many can you collect?</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment your score and difficulty!<br/></p>\n<p>---CONTROLS---<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move.</p>\n<p>Space - Activate ability that allows you to teleport through a wall in the direction of the mouse after a one second delay.</p>\n<p>1 - Restart the game in Easy difficulty. (default)</p>\n<p>2 - Restart the game in Hard difficulty.</p>\n<p>You'll know what difficulty you're on based on the soundtrack.</p>\n\n<p>---TIPS---</p>\n<ul><li>The amount of drones increases with time, not with your score. Therefore, you should minimize time not spent looking for more capsules.</li><li>Drones have less control over their movement than you do, especially on Hard due to their increased speed. Use this to get around them.</li><li>Drones must have you in their vision for a period of time before they actually notice you. Use this to either hide without being pursued or to get a head start running from them.</li><li>There are always exactly four capsules on the map at any given time. You don't need to risk dying just to get one particular capsule, you can go grab others while you wait for drones that may be in your way to despawn or be lured elsewhere.</li><li>An invalid attempt at a wall jump will result in no jump at all, but will still put the ability on cooldown. It can be advantageous at times to pre-emptively use the ability if you're not sure if you'll need to jump or not, as a way of circumventing the delay.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was made for the AI and Games Jam 2021 by a team of four people.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24b29eab53a37fb4cd937f81090bcd1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TechEpic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
