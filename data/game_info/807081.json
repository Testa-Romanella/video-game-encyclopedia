Only the most curious, patient and sharp-sighted will be able to finish this game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNice graphics, detailed animations and a relaxing soundtrack will make all the annoyance accumulated during the day go away, and the joy of finding one will add endorphins to your body, so we see no reason why you would not want to try playing at least a couple of times :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T06:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e09fb5e83df5e56d0eb8ac69f9d1a865.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HotFoodGames"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["HotFoodGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
