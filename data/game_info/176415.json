This is what you get for playing the CAT GOD.</p>\n<p>I also includes the soundtrack for this game in the file!And if you like those songs,\u00a0be sure to check out my Youtube channel:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiQ4F7WZ5-soYvvgrXEyd1Q</p>\n<p>I mainly made English\u00a0 Vocaloid songs.
