I\u00a0would like to say there was a lot of \"potty humor\" in the game, but anyone that has pooped themself in a social setting knows that it is not a laughing matter.</p>\n<p>This is a short game, at just 1,207 words. It does, however, have its own four track instrumental OST and was inspired by a free lo-fi acapella album.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd9fba731cc967f0cf978d8015063ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["yam655"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
