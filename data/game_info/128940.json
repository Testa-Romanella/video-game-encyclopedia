It was created by transforming the NetHack source code through Markov chains, and arranging the resulting code into interesting shapes.</p><p>NetHack has strange but fascinating source code. I was inspired by the PROGRAMR_BAT twitter bot by Liam, which tweets out single lines of code from various codebases. NetHack is always easy to pick out because it's so distinctive, and it's often a lot more poignant and aesthetically interesting out of context than it is in context. I was interested in experimenting with other ways to remove the original meaning from the code so it could be enjoyed purely from an aesthetic standpoint.</p><p>This is a silly toy, but hopefully an interesting one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/244fa552038a494bfcf10c489f8369ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mstea"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
