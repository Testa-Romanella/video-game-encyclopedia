I tested the game as I made it, things SHOULD be stable. Game controls will display on screen, but I think the battle menu controls might not be, and may not be intuitive. Space should work as select.</p>\n<p>The game technically is not finished, but I think I will take a break from its development. Someday I may return to this, maybe I will never return to this.</p>\n<p>I was too lazy to find audio tracks or sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T03:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/91451e0910cfa1109e12c58453124152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["apaperstar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
