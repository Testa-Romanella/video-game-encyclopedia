At one point in the game, I made a game with the Slots RPG combination and that got me wondering what a real Slots RPG game would look like. So I dropped the game and started taking notes of what came to mind. I also drew some mockups to have a better idea of what I had in mind. 5 months later, here's King Cashing! So, hum, thanks Kairosoft!<br/><br/>\u2605 Featured in What's Hot Games in United States, Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia<br/>\u2605 Featured in New and Noteworthy Games in 114 countries including<br/>United States, Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia<br/>\u2605 Featured in Top 10 Casino games in 19 countries<br/>\u2605 Featured in Top 10 RPG Games in 7 countries", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2106908fff26934aade02e3fd5d2593f.jpg", "website": "http://www.kingcashing.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Productions Multimage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Productions Multimage"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
