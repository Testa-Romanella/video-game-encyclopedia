But as the chaos rages around you,   your   mind   seems to drift...<br/></em></strong></strong><strong><strong><em> your memories grow contradictory. You fear   that  you are   going mad. Are you living in two places at once? Are you  experiencing   an  alternate life in a parallel reality?\r\n               Are you one man in one world... or two identical copies sharing    one   mind   and two realities?\r\n               You must survive the war to find the truth. </em></strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>You must stake everything      on  finding yourself. It's double or nothing.\r\n               \r\n               With one joystick you control two alternate versions of the  protagonist.       One version (left-hand screen) fights an alien invasion  of Earth, the   other    (right-hand screen) fights an army of robots. Occasionally  both  versions   may enter the same reality.\u00a0 Eventually both men will  enter  a shared   space outside normal spacetime, where they can confront  the source  of the   invasions.</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Use joystick in port 2 or VICE controlled keys<br/>Run Stop / Escape - Pause<br/>Q\u00a0 (While paused - Abort mission)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Original SEUCK code <strong>Sensisoft</strong><br/>Game design, loading bitmap, graphics and sound effects by <strong>Alf Yngve</strong><br/>SEUCK Redux source code and tape loader by <strong>Martin Piper<br/></strong>Additional front end and programming by <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Title screen logo by <strong>Shine/Delysid</strong><br/>Music by <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(C)2014 Alf Yngve.
