Having not developed a Phaser game for a long time, this is the first time using Phaser 3 and switching from functional code to classes. I've tried to make it close to the original complete with sounds effects, smartbombs, hyperspace and can be played with the keyboard or an Xbox Controller. All of the timings for enemies, are configured so I may tweak these later.</strong></p>KeyboardXBox ControllerMovementCursor KeysLeft StickFireLeft ShiftASmart BombSpaceBHyperspaceHY", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/99505fd4043ce0db80c721104cbde244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GaryD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
