The current version is a prototype/demo so there's not much gameplay and most of it is from assets but I plan to update/change it over time. Im currently curious to see how well the current demo would perform on mobile and PC. And it will ALWAYS be FREE! <br/></p>\n<p>The demo is still very glitchy so at any point it stops working, Press [R] button on the keyboard or the restart icon on mobile to reload the level.<br/></p>\n<p>For a more cinematic feel, play Kick Back in the background. <br/></p>\n<p>Banner Image: @OfficialEaero  (free wallpaper)<br/>Chainsaw Man Model: james94 on cgtrader <br/>Environment: Unity Asset Store Japanese Street</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Attack 1 - Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Attack 2 - Right Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Jump - Space Bar</p>\n<p>Run - Hold Shift and Move</p>\n<p>Some Attack Combos:</p>\n<p>Run and Attack 1</p>\n<p>Attack 1\u00a0 - Attack 1 - Attack 2</p>\n<p>Attack 2\u00a0 - Attack 2 - Attack 2 - Attack 1</p>\n<p>Hold Down Attack 1 or Attack 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T17:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/064/06469e204deae7125facaf1bbdffa779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["WaraiDandy"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
