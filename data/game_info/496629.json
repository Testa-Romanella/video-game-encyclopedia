Seriously, this took a bit of navigation...but the payoff is definitely worth it. The environment is easy to get into, especially with the supporting audio, and once I got into the hang of what I was supposed to do, and where to find the test stations, all went smoothly. I was actually entranced by the whole experience, and felt that I just HAD to get to the end. This is [a] most ambitious work...with a piece that delivers a political message within the framework of a game that is actually no game at all - it's the serious business of where do we all go from here. Nice work. I hope this converts some minds. It should do.\" <br/></em>\n<p>\u2013 Alan Bigelow, lecturer in Creative Writing and New Media at De\u00a0Montfort University.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<em>\u201c#PRISOM...examines online realities since Edward Snowden\u2019s exposure of classified documents as evidence of the participation of companies like AOL, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Paltalk, Skype, Yahoo!, and YouTube, as well as wearable technologies, in the NSA\u2019s PRISM data-mining program...#PRISOM ask[s] us to question the normalization of domestic surveillance as a part of everyday life in the context of a country whose international clout has been historically anchored to its democratic principles.\"</em>\n<p>\u2013 Dale Hudson, New York University Abu Dhabi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<em>\u201cDespite the release of multiple documentaries and what seemed like a social sea change in public perception on the issue of surveillance, there is still remarkably little discussion on this topic. #PRISOM is not only a general reminder of the wider culture of surveillance, but by situating this work in the context of a videogames, it raises questions specifically about ludic surveillance and how game analytics, data capture, and digital distribution naturalize panoptic culture. Videogames are uniquely positioned as training devices to assist with the internalization of surveillance as a rule rather than exception and I think this work does a good job of foregrounding that conversation. This is a fine contribution to the series.\u201d</em>\n<p>\u2013 Electronic Literature Organisation Conference Panel Review.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<em>\"#PRISOM is fantastic...[I] managed to get through to a little secret platform where I was able to Eyejack some drones. Hilarious-disturbing and thought-provoking stuff throughout, and tons of awesome phrase-coinage.
