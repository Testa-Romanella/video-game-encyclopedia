The planet\u00a0also cools down if not tended to, so the player must ensure that the planet does not freeze from no heat, or burn from too much heat. The game consists of four levels, and each level introduces a new challenge.\r\n</p>\n<p>My roles during the development were initial concept development,\u00a0programming\u00a0the entire game, level design, and\u00a0designing\u00a0the menus. Yaohui Chai\u00a0produced the sprites and backgrounds for the game. This was a collaborative effort, and every aspect of the game was discussed and approved together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4ec11372b97bea7641b4e2d0bbc9723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Finn Kennedy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
