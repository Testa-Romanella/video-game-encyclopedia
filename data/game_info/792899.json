This time, we were required to make a game using given number of inputs.</p>\n<p>Our team got six inputs including two analog inputs. We decided to use one analog input to control move direction, and use the other to control gravity direction. For the rest four digital inputs, we thought about the\u00a0three primary colors and light.\u00a0So in our game, the player can use three buttons to turn on or turn off the lights with the three primary color, and use the last button to turn on or turn off the light for the world. Some platforms may change depending on what colors are lit and what are not. And what's more, those platform may not stay still as the player changes gravity direction. Try to get to the end with the magic of gravity and lights!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T16:32:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9eafd190fd785feddbfb342504c99329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oswald33"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
