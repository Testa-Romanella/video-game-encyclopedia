It transforms your exercise equipment into a world of games, making your cardio workout engaging and fun - the exact opposite of a typical distraction-based cardio experience! Goji Play works best with elliptical trainer, stationary bike, steppers, or nearly any piece of cardio equipment that you can control the speed of your own motion.  For treadmill users, speed/hill walks are fun and easy to do with Goji Play.  <br/><br/>The Goji Play 2 app is now iOS 9 compatible, and supports both the new and old Goji Play controllers.  It continues to serve as the game hub for all Goji Play 2-compatible games so that you do not need to search for them in the AppStore.  New Goji Play 2 and upgraded GP1 games are constantly being added -- be sure to check the Games Tiles of the Goji Play 2 app often.
