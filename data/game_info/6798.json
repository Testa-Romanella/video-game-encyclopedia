The all-new Atomic Pinball Collection from the Graphics and Physics masterminds at Color Monkey and Nena is finally here. Get ready for some serious action with the best original pinball tables available. All tables are designed to be fully functional as real physical pinball tables.<br/><br/><br/>MASKS OF GLORY<br/><br/>Set in the Mexican wrestling scene Lucha Libre, Masks of Glory is a fun and challenging table. With a Tequila Bar, different multi-ball modes, chickens, Bumper Mania, pi\u00f1atas, the Good-vs-Evil-meter, illegal moves, lowriders, and tasty tacos, there is always plenty to do, or eat.<br/><br/>You are the underdog trying to beat the other contenders like the bullying Diabeto, El Ligre, Carnal Muerte, the annoying Los Hermanitos Gallitos brothers and the playboy El Fantastico with hair so greasy you can almost feel it.<br/><br/>But beware of El Diablo, the current reigning champion. He is big and bad, and his breath is even worse.<br/><br/><br/>REVENGE OF THE ROB-O-BOT<br/><br/>This re-imagined version of the classic is back with more missions, updated graphics, new sounds (meet the new Betty!) and an even meaner Rob-O-Bot!<br/><br/>The intergalactic Rob-O-Bot has invaded and is laying waste to this once peaceful city of the future. No-one knows why or where he comes from. It\u2019s not important. Help Bazooka Betty to save the metropolis from destruction! But stay alert, the Rob-O-Bot is programmed for REVENGE!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0fb7cda007c3314a504ee2bb8865b48.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nena Innovation"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nena Innovation"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
