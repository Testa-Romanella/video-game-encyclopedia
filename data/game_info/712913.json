This planet is a giant sleeping monster and he has been recently awakened by some disturbance. As an Underwater Explorer your job is to find out what happened to this creature, but you have to be careful to not wake him up.\r\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay of <em>There is lead in the water </em>it's Downwell mixed with a fast paced fps, the main gimmick is that in every level you can be in two different states, underwater or inside an air bubble. while in the water you can\u2019t double jump but your dash is omnidirectional. Meanwhile if you are above water\u00a0 To beat the game you have to go to the deepest part of the cave you are exploring.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was developed in 3 days using some previously developed assets, and it was intended to be submitted to a gamejam, but I couldn\u2019t finish it in time. The themes of the gamejam were fear of depths. The game is really buggy and has no audio, Another know issue is the performance problems associated with this game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb506e194e512119dcad3bc220f471b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wyvex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
