And a boost.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong></p>\n<p>My third prototype-a-month project from back in 2014. This was my first attempt at both a 3D game and\u00a0a kart racer. It is largely preserved as it was back then, but I had to add\u00a0an exit feature\u00a0because the original was a web browser\u00a0build and therefore didn't need it at the time. I also tossed in a very small amount\u00a0of help info which you can access from the keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNINGS + BONUS FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p>Now, don't expect much, I struggled with the physics so the control is\u00a0pretty restrictive. Still, it's fun to buzz around the open\u00a0arena. I did enable the boost strip that which is the only decent feature on top of basic driving. However, there is a trick mode you can enable to unlock some additional track features, that is\u00a0if you don't mind additional brokenness.</p>\n<p><em>TIP:\u00a0\u00a0Use a gamepad if possible, but keyboard driving\u00a0is supported.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a2672da2b2d8c1f1ae6522e5882620a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cosmic Misfit Drew"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
