The only use of VBA is to adjust normal keyboard functionality and to apply the new game state at each time step.</p><p>The gamejam's theme is downgrade: clearly, this refers to the graphics quality achieved in Excel, but no reference TO THE FUN!</p>\n<p>The simulator is currently very light on features\u2026<br/>\u00a0- Gravity between the spaceship and the planet<br/>\u00a0- Move the spaceship by all three axes using WASDQE<br/>\u00a0- Apply thrusters using ENTER<br/>\u00a0- Graphics includes raytraced phong-based lighting</p>\n<p>Features in the pipeline:<br/>\u00a0- Shadow rays<br/>\u00a0- Reflections<br/>\u00a0- Landing<br/>\u00a0- Orbit statistics and visualizations<br/>\u00a0- Ability to dock with other ships<br/>\u00a0- Ability to control more than one ship<br/>\u00a0- Additional moon to explore<br/>\u00a0- Theoretically, we could look at using the planet texture as a heightmap\u2026<br/>\u00a0- And anything fun that you suggest!</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>First, you need to go to the sheet named \"Screen\". Next, you need to press the \"Start\" button to initiate the simulation.</p>\n<p>This macro assigns new functionality to the following keys:<br/>\u00a0- \"w\", \"a\", \"s\", \"d\", \"q\", \"e\": hold these to rotate the ship along one its three axes<br/>\u00a0- \"Enter\": hold to ignite the thrusters<br/>\u00a0- \"ESC\": press this to end the game and reset all key functionality</p>\n<p>NOTE: this macro overrides these key's normal functionality - you must preferably press the STOP button or ESC at the end of your session to reenble these keys in Excel to their original functionality.<br/>If the macro suggests an error, simple press \"Continue\" and try again - otherwise the key reset will not occur. If all else fails, restart Excel to reset key functionality.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33ce21eecd84a5b659878657e822b6b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s0lly"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
