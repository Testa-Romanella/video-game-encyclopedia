The gameplay is pretty simple - more or less a clone of Flappy Bird - but I hope that it might inspire anyone who sees it to go check out Tonc and devkitPro and perhaps go out there to make their own Gameboy Advance game!</p><p>I will be going into detail over on my blog in the next few weeks on how I made the game (including some actual examples because finding any concrete examples of some of the things I wanted to do online is a NIGHTMARE), my thoughts and feelings on it, and what I plan to do in the future. I will also likely put the music up at some point, either on my Bandcamp, or on my Soundcloud.</p><p><strong>FEATURES:<br/></strong>-Background Parallaxing<br/>-A score counter<br/>-TWO entire songs, composed by me in OpenMPT!<br/>-An animated player sprite, complete with rotation like the original Flappy Bird!<br/>-<em>Might</em> work on a real GBA! I haven't tested yet due to the ongoing quarantine!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/594606db2b2c2c9b2caaa244a127c02b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIM ROYAL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
