This time I bring you an endless runner I've been working on starring Chantilly, my girlfriend's 13yo polar bear plush XD</strong>\n<strong>She and her mother gave me ideas of stuff I could create to practice my coding, then I picked this one.\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>It's nice when you don't have any idea of what type of game you want to create, you can\u00a0just look around and imagine anything. The idea can be very specific or uncommon, but it's still an idea, isn't it?</strong>\n<strong>Well, you are in Chantilly's shoes and you must run from a BIG ice cream ball rolling behind you while you try to avoid obstacles from the Neapolitan Land, not much more to say about the game,</strong> it is what it is.\u00a0\r\n<strong>Take the heart \"cherries\" to get more lives. As the game goes, the ice cream ball gets bigger and closer to you. Even if the game is an endless runner, if you play for 1 hour non-stop, you can say you've beaten the game.</strong>\n<strong>Music by: Jeremy Blake - Powerup!</strong>\n<strong>I've made another game before this one, a Space Invaders style\u00a0one. Go and try it out!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T06:45:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/7767c0861c82a81ab5c8b91712f9372c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Khristar"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
