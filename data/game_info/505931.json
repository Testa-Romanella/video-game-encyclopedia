You will die over and over again learning the in and out<br/>t's of the levels. How long will you take? Can you beat the game with your sanity still intact? The Game will continue to be updated the more it is out, so you can expect levels upon levels with time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as three cubes of all different sizes. You use them to complete puzzles to make it to the end of the level. For people that like it easy, you can complete the game by only getting one of the three cubes to the end, but if you want a real challenge you can get all the cubes to the end for the true ending.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T03:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fdb10e4e715b785b72d4c517bd4d489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareBoxStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SquareBoxStudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
