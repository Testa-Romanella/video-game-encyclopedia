You're a tiny Bonemeal lost in the world. How long can you survive?

Can you help Bonemeal reach level 12?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basic WASD control scheme. 1-9 buttons used for spells.</p>\n<p>15 spells to help even the odds.<br/></p>\n<p>12 different Commons to fight.</p>\n<p>Planned updates to include more Commons and new playable characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monster designs are based on drawings I made as a child (circa 2001). I drew hundreds of these, but sadly only 7 pages survive (containing 56 Commons). I plan on adding all of them to this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:52:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc3a0d7297b53ab71265d5a35c8f2f16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oddonomics"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
