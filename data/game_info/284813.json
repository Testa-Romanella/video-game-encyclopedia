Hop on your cycle and get ready to take down the competition! Being the first to cross the finish line doesn\u2019t just mean you have the fastest bike, you\u2019ll also need to hit the turbo zones at the right time, jump over obstacles, and avoid the dreaded slow zones. <br/><br/>Once the races are over, try your hand at the Chase Mode which challenges you to see how far you can go before being pulled over by the police. Check the leaderboards regularly to see where you stack up against the competition. Super Moto X is compatible with the Goji Play exercise system (www.bluegoji.com). With Goji Play your cardio exercise ties directly to gameplay, making workouts fly by!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8ee43e308bd15614847b2ef3197017a_QLUkIJV.jpg", "website": "http://www.bluegoji.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Blue Goji"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Blue Goji Corp"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
