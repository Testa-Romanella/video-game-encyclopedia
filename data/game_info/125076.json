It happened in a few tests but we couldn't replicate it consistently, so we don't know what's causing it. If it happens to you, close the game and open it again and it should solve this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer 2:</strong> The text in the intro screens are on low resolution (a small mistake), this will be fixed on future builds .<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/hand-painted-...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/3d-items-free-wand-pack-4...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/awesome-stylized-m...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/fire-spell-e...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/hand-painted-...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/rocky-texture...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/free-trees-103208<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/free-hdr-sky-612...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/low-poly-weapons-71680<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/battle-dragon-axe-...<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/flight-magic-icon-33252</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>https://www.textures.com/download/paperpage0055/101101?q=paper</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Vehicle/sounds/319600/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/loudernoises/sounds/334169/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/32cheeseman32/sounds/180825/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/420875/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Kodras/sounds/95827/</p>\n</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Music Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Rising Game Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Willow and the Light Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>Rites Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>Truth of the Legend Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) (edited)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac31f1ae18f6c25073f05bc05144e829.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZactarZero"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
