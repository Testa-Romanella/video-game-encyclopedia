Developed primarily for consoles, the franchise differs from the PC-based Football Manager and Championship Manager series by focusing on visual details such as a fully 3D match engine, although still maintaining the realism and level of detail craved by fans of the genre - a unique combination when the series was first released.</p>\n<p>The series has different titles in different regions: LMA Manager in the UK (named after the League Managers Association), BDFL Manager in Germany (Bund Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Lehrer, basically the German equivalent of the LMA), Manager de Liga in Spain, Football Manager Campionato in Italy, and FC Manager - La Passion du Foot in France since the 2006 edition (the French edition of the series was previously named Roger Lemerre - La S\u00e9lection des Champions after the former coach of the French national team).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54ea0804c2b80bc65aa0a64f8d7ee5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
