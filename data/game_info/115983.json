They get stronger and stronger each wave meaning you will have to upgrade from the shops around you. Currently you can purchase pets (Dragon, Wolf) to help you fight them off, and a turret to fire bolts at the horde and upgrading your bow. A really fun game if I had to say it myself, plan to build a community with 'runs' like who can finish the game first, and tips &amp; tricks.<br/><br/>I dont actually want to charge for my games, but everything will go towards buying licenses so I can spread my work to multiply platforms (Mac/Linux) Game Maker License, and sound/soundtrack licenses. Hope you will support me, it would mean the world to me! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f573561d37fc0041031889caad471aa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zaphgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
