To be able to make the traditional, secret mushroom soup recipe for the inauguration, he embarks on the adventure of his life time, experiencing that some of his grandfathers' stories are more than that.</p>\n<p>This game prototype has been created by one person with a myriad of OpenSource assets (for a detailed list, see \"list_of_opensource_assets.txt\" in the download section below or in the game menu) over five days (60 to 80 hours total) for the The Pacifist Jam (Honest Jam IV), which lasted from July 23rd 2022, until August 1st 2022. The task was to create a game without violence as core game play mechanic. This entry tries to show this with a classical platformer scheme; a genre that normally uses a lot of (stylized) violence. As a core game mechanic, it was planned to focus onto the influence of the inventory onto the player's abilities to act (running, jumping, etc.). Due to time constraints, this feature is only partially implemented. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Despite being playable in the browser, one should download the executables, as the online gaming experience is not great.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirements:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Play in Browser:</strong><ul><li>Web Browser capable of running WebGL</li><li>Keyboard and Mouse</li><li>Screen with at least 1080 px height (recommended: 1920x1080)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Play on your Machine:<br/></strong><ul><li>Windows or Linux x86, 64 bits</li><li>Keyboard and Mouse</li><li>Screen with at least 768 px height (recommended: 1366x768); alternatively: 1080p</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known\u00a0issues:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Font size/spacing too small (issue font implementation in Godot 3.x),</li><li>Physics of pickable objects and collisions a bit broken,</li><li>Inventory management not implemented completely,</li><li>Jump height too low,</li><li>Balancing not optimal,</li><li>Too much text on the screen,</li><li>Game does not scale with screen resolution,</li><li>Optimized for 1080p native play; browser and other resolutions do not give as good results.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:50:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0fba796dd3024e9b98de0a84da371ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dsacre"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
