Their wants came to me because every king wants land because land is powerful. All three characters want the same thing and that's why they are a conflict of interest to each other. \u00a0Each character has a different reason for why they want the land, so their thought process and decision making is on different ends of the spectrum. I made the decision choices based off of what I would have picked and what I thought flowed the best. I chose them to make the story go in the direction I wanted it to go. The most difficult part about coming up with this story was trying to make every characters decision making connect in someway. I worked to align the readers interest with the characters motivations by keeping the moral of the story relatable , but also keeping the readers on their toes so it wasn't predictable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbc4db041713cd9da9d26991eae3dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DCTHree"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
