In the meantime I am working on another game that shares similar goals and graphics to this so keep an eye out. My Instagram would be best place to check for new updates on any new games.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Instagram - Nutty Studios</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:59:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3ab62c93db219f77cf5901f7ce86950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nutty Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
