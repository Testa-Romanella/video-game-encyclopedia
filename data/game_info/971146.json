In the meantime, enjoy yourself. Go on and play games within games if you'd like, but remember!... fortune favours the curious.<br/><br/>Proyecto Flamingo X1 is an epic boss fight. Man vs Machine... naturally! <br/>You should know this is a hard game. It\u2019s not an easy feat to beat the machine and even then, that is just the beginning. However,  if you\u2019ve made it this far reading the description, it gives me the impression you\u2019re one that focuses on details. Well then... you just might have a shot at revealing something truly great. Good luck!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><strong>No Tutorials</strong><br/>We take pride in making our experiences tutorial free. I mean really!! Did you ever use the paper clip to learn how to use Microsoft word? Or have you ever read a manual in your entire life? Who wants a bore telling you how to go about your experience. So, figure it out like a true gamer.<br/><br/><strong>Hard Level</strong><br/>Not a single person has ever beaten this game on their first try or their second, yet it is engaging to try again and again.
