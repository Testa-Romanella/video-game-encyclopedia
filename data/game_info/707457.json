{"id": 707457, "slug": "brass-labyrinth", "name": "Brass Labyrinth", "name_original": "Brass Labyrinth", "description": "<p>Levi Walker, Jane Anderson, and Samuel Pinnex combined their efforts to create\u00a0<em>Brass Labyrinth</em>\u00a0- a fully functional procedurally generated rouge-like experience. This game generates a random map seed based on pre-set parameters and randomly spawns in items, enemies, and the player character. There are two fully voiced and playable characters; the mage and the knight. Upon defeating 4 trolls, the victory screen will appear and you can either replay with another character or exit the application.\u00a0Venture into the depths of the Brass Labyrinth, vanquish the trolls, and claim victory! This version of the project was made using Unreal Engine 5 in November 2021.</p>\n<p>We plan on continuing to work and improve this project in the future to bring more features, enhance gameplay, and smooth over bugs.</p>\n<p>(Alpha Version 0.0.1.0 - This demo version is for gameplay testing purposes only, and the amount of trolls has been affected as a result of packaging the game via Visual Studio 2022's SDK, so there will typically only be 4 trolls that spawn in instead of 5. This eliminates the ability to trigger the victory screen and animation. This bug will be addressed upon version 0.0.1.1)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf7bf1f5b97e5ca1388887f45c88c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SJL Productions"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
