But if anyone is able to complete the game please tell us~!</p>\n<p>Okay so, this is our incomplete game - lost wallet.<br/>It's a sidescroller w/ combat.<br/>We originally intended to address the topic of rewind more esoterically when it came to applying it to game mechanics.<br/>Story begins with the main character at the \"Final Boss\",<br/>with Suit upgrades and what have you - it's set underwater and it was a huge octopus (the art was finished for it just no time to code it)<br/>Upon defeating it, it's revealed that the main character is currently running back through his memory of the day having come back from defeating the boss,<br/>And is trying to work out where he left his wallet (dumb but fun). It proceeds to run through a number of levels where the main character loses his one shot protection, unlimited jumps, and has his number of avaliable projectiles on screen reduced over time.<br/>We didn't want to take away any mechanics that felt fun, we wanted to make the game harder, by increasing the accuracy and precision required of the player,<br/>justifying it through the main character progressing back through time as he rolls through his memories.<br/>The game originally had 2 intended bosses, the \"first\" (final) boss being a cute<br/>inconspicuous starfish (that was pretty terrifying).<br/>Game was meant to have text box narration providing narrative context.<br/>It's a shame we couldn't get it all done, but it was a good learning experience. We intend to finish off the game later on.<br/>as it stands only the middle levels are playable. Hope you enjoy playing it regardless!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc181588025a5f1d38c9eedff9b22154.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chucklefart", "Nysralel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
