Also swiped was his computerized military defense system, which the evil thugs have reprogrammed to destroy the world. Now his future, and ultimately Earth&#39;s survival, depend on your crack Mission Impossible Team to perform a secret surgical strike and rescue. But to pull off this operation, you must be daring enough to command three different IMF identities - Max, Grant, and Nicholas. Each has special agent talents and firepower which you must master to survive six torturous levels with dozens of hidden Espionage Zones. So good luck, Jim. As always, should any of your IM Force be caught, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions... THIS BOX WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IN 5 SECONDS!</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "1990-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-15T22:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bf5/bf5c059bc71e2b71fc0cf578d969664e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 15, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ultra Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
