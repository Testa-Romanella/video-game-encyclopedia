Seriously.</p>\n<p>The two shapes are :</p>\n<p>- The bruiser : first attack melee, second is a stomp that deal damage in a zone around him</p>\n<p>- The shooter : first attack is a projectile, second is a jump. During the jump the shooter can't be damaged.</p>\n<p>There are transformers to change shape on the left and the right of the ring.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/2709b0f4223cae949af5b32331d9cb24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OuicheDoctor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
