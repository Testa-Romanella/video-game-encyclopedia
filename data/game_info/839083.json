This was my first game jam and I'm proud I was able to submit in time. I'm kinda disappointed because there's much more I would have done if I had time (Like adding\u00a0mudic, more complex puzzles or more puzzle elements) but overall I'm satisfied. Jams are all about learning and having fun, and I definitely learnt a lot from this and had TONS of fun. This is also my first public game, that's pretty cool! Maybe I'll polish this after the jam end.</p>\n<p>The game is about\u00a0<em>collaborating with your body's A.I.</em> because when your head is attached to your body you <strong>can't jump</strong>. When you detach your head from your body, your body will move on it's own, but it will be able to jump on <strong>your command</strong>. By making your body interact with the enviroment you can complete up to 8 levels filled with\u00a0<strong>puzzles</strong>!</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0open source, but the project is a big mess.
