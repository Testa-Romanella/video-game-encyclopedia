The Floor is Jelly posits a universe made of jello, made purely for one's own amusement. No longer need we look to our walls and our floors and sigh, \"How solid! How sadly immalleable! How I wish for a world consisting only of Non-Newtonian fluids!\" That world has arrived, via the dark magic of videogames, as\u00a0<em>The Floor is Jelly.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c0822445dd0a70fa53b392eaf40fb306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["iansnyder"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
