You must kill him and take back your wings.</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\n<p>You shoot enemies, collect offerings (coins, and ingots), buy new skills, get new guns, go to next area, repeat that 2 more times, then you can fight the god of war. The skills can heavily affect how hard the game is, so make sure to get them, same goes for new guns. If you die you go all the way back to the beginning. <br/></p>\r\nTIPS:\r\n<p>When you touch the gun object, whatever frame it is on is the one you will get, so its not random. Progression to next area is based on how many offerings you have so collect them all. The skill buying menu is wonky so you may have to press the skill you want multiple times, it also will buy it once you hover over the OFFER button. Gun doom is OP but doom skills do NOT work against the boss (get both for special text during boss fight).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e57e124d8788c6e7bbcad1c456bc716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LW132"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
