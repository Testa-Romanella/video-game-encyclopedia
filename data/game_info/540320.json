The quick game itself is a fast mode, where two players face off against each other to bring down the opponent's life. The competitive game also includes tournaments that will be available in the future: this mode is instead a more demanding mode than the others, defeating other players you will get points, while if you are defeated, you will lose them. Be careful, because it won't be as easy as you think! First of all you will have to study a winning tactic, or you will blow up the whole fight! We strongly recommend that you complete the story mode 100% before going into this mode, so you can improve the statistics of the team characters. The cooperative game instead is divided into two different modes: two-on-two combat, or cooperative story mode. The latter will help you complete story mode in company from start to finish. It will be possible to play from 2-4 players online for the cooperative story mode, or 2 players offline on the same platform. Online mode doesn't stop there!
