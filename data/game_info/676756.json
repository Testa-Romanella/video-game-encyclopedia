Sadly for all of you, meteors are coming your way! You can shoot them off on problem, but without an engineer, you have to stabilize the ship's core as well. Not only that, you also have to keep track of the 4 different factors affecting your firepower and core stability!</p>\n<p><strong>Temperature</strong> is the simplest of the factors. Push a button and increase the bar. Don't increase it too high, or else the core will grow out of control. High temperature means high damage bullets that you fire!</p>\n<p><strong>Pressure </strong>is influenced by a slider. Put up the slider, and the bar increases. Put it down, and the bar decreases. High pressure provides good damage, as well as increasing projectile speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Electricity </strong>is increased by a knob. Hold and turn the knob clockwise in order to charge electricity! High electricity means high projectile fire rate! Careful about your energy supply though!</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency </strong>is increased by pressing one of nine buttons, according to which one lights up. High efficiency means bullets use less energy, so you can spam to your heart's content!</p>\n<p>Having the 4 factors being high means that you get greater firepower to deal with meteors. But it also means that the core will grow faster! Occasionally decrease the factors in order to maintain a balance and to keep the core from exploding.</p>\n<p>Maintain the core, destroy the meteors, and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e661d6dbed33905bfac2df7d6781b2a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
