They&#39;re so unfriendly that they can&#39;t even get along with each other. Unfortunately, there are a lot of them, and they&#39;re all out to get you!</p>\n<p>You managed to get stuck in an anti-aircraft bunker in a strategic area, without any troop reinforcements. You know that the enemy is going to be coming in droves, so you&#39;re glad that you have a huge supply of ammo to defend yourself.</p>\n<h3>THE GAME:</h3>\n<p>Your bunker is at the bottom of the screen. You control the position of the gun with either the keyboard (using the left &amp; right arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to shoot) or the mouse.</p>\n<p>The enemy aircraft will be coming across the top of the screen, dropping paratroopers as they go. You need to prevent the paratroopers from landing, because if three of them land, they&#39;ll be able to invade your bunker and overpower you! (Fortunately for you, they bicker amongst themselves so much that if they land right next to each other, one of them will kill the other.)</p>\n<p>You can shoot the planes. You can shoot the paratroopers. You can shoot the paratroopers&#39; chutes off, and watch them plummet helplessly to the ground (killing any paratroopers that happen to be underneath). Basically, if it moves, shoot it...</p>\n<p>Be extremely careful with the smart bombs - they&#39;re deadly!</p>\n<h3>INTERMISSIONS:</h3>\n<p>After you&#39;ve beaten back enough of the enemy troops, there&#39;ll be a chance for your compatriots to supply a few things to satisfy basic human needs. Enjoy the reprieve while you can!</p>\n<h3>CONCLUSION:</h3>\n<p>What are you waiting for? Go to it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f964138612798b57d27b9437a8f8a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Argo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Software Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
