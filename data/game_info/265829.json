Squares with special symbols will remove extra squares.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move Patrick to a square using the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Note that you can (and sometimes must)\u00a0move diagonally by pressing two arrow keys simultaneously.</p>\r\nLimitations\r\n<ul><li>Puzzles might be impossible to solve!</li><li>The game doesn't recognize if you win or lose. If the screen is empty except for Patrick, you win! If you have no legal moves, you lose and must restart the game manually.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/744a0bcd952c46ec452a7352fa275181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tobiasvl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
