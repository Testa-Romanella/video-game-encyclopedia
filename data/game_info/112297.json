Upon admitting myself, I was given my patient rights which indicated that as a voluntary patient, I was allowed to leave whenever I wanted. This was not necessarily the case as there was a lot of legal barriers holding me back. I did admit myself for help, but the actual stay was more detrimental to my mental health than having just stayed home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fdd1ba237bb510001a6f673f01b1abe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dianaphamhere"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
