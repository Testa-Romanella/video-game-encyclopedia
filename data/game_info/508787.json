You are the commander of this mission and you have a set of units working well as a team.<br/>When on a mission (this checkerboard-like map you can see on the screens) you need to give orders to your units in real time and defeat the enemy force or complete the objective.\u00a0<br/>So far you can select units and move them with left clic. Once in range the units will attack each other automatically. You can also rotate around the camera with Z,Q,S,D keys.<br/><br/>If I had to continue working on the prototype :<br/>\u2022 Add a campaign menu to get recon info about your next mission and choose which one to do<br/>\u2022 Add a camp menu where you can upgrade and check your units between 2 missions.<br/>\u2022 Do the AI behaviour<br/>\u2022 Set up different abilities for player and enemy units<br/>\u2022 Implement victory and defeat conditions<br/>\u2022 And many more ..<br/><br/>Feel free to ask if you need more detail about the game concept ! I've got a game doc ready to be read :-)<br/><br/>The git : https://github.com/imaqtpony/RTS_Proto.git<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea726f29133bb4dc778a673226b256b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt BM"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
