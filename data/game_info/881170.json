Something is lurking among the trees and bushes, and now a camper has disappeared. People have reported strange noises, loud stomping, and odd track prints, but no one has spotted any large animals in the area. Is it just another bear, or something.... worse? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as the park ranger to discover the true reason why campers have been going missing in this first-person, stealth-based horror game. Use your evasiveness skills and tools around you to explore the park for signs of what may have happened to the missing camper.
