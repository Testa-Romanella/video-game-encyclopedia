It takes place in the Lego universe, where the evil Lord Business finds a weapon of mass destruction called &quot;Kragle&quot;. It is prophesied, that a Special One will come with the Piece of Resistance. Eight years later, Emmet Brickowski wakes up in his flat. On his job, he falls down a hole and finds the Piece, upon which he gets grabbed by Wyldstyle.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like in previous Lego games by TT Fusion, the players control a vast cast of characters from The LEGO Movie. The players traverse the levels that are completely made up from Lego bricks, completing different objectives. </p>\n<p>There are two types of characters present in the game: Regular Builders and Master Builders. The main difference is that the Regular Builders are unable to build objects without the needed instructional pages, while the Master Builders can build any object at any time. All the objects built by the players resemble the items from the real-life Lego sets. </p>\n<p>90 characters are present in the game. The game features the original Lego characters such as Wyldstyle or Lord Business, as well as the ones present in the real-life Lego building sets, such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Gandalf, and many more.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2014-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-01T10:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b83/b8382775bded4811c7492cc5d850683a.jpg", "website": "http://www.lego.com/thelegomovie", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 81, "owned": 1459, "beaten": 176, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 55, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 181, "ratings_count": 220, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 225, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360", "Wii U", "Nintendo 3DS", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Warner Bros.
