Like in most strategy games, the gameplay focuses on gathering resources, building armies, and using them to annihilate the enemies or complete tasks. There are both singleplayer and multiplayer modes available to the players.</p>\n<p>The singleplayer campaign consists of a number of levels. On each level, the players have a primary objective with several side-quests which can change as the mission progresses.</p>\n<p>The main ship of the fleet serves as a mothership, which can build other ships. The mothership cannot move. There are immovable objects on every level, which can be mined using special ships that will take the ores to the mothership. These resources are later used to build new ships, such as miners or attack vessels. </p>\n<h3>Remastered Edition featured</h3>\n<p>The gameplay was left untouched by Gearbox Software.
