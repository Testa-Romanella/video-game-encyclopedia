The deadly cylons will be pursuing you, but those toasters are not very smart... try to get them to crash into each other!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic Robots Gameplay</strong>\u00a0 with keyboard or mouse!</li><li><strong>Advanced features</strong>\u00a0such as EMP charge weapons, high-risk enemies that move twice as fast, and safe teleports.</li><li><strong>Tiny, unobtrusive graphics</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Micro Mode</strong>\u00a0- The game only occupies a fraction of your\u00a0screen real estate, and can even be displayed in half size on high DPI displays, making it perfect for discreetly playing at work or while watching something on your computer.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Currently I only release mac binaries, as that's the only platform I play these games on. There is no reason why they should not work on other platforms however. They are written in Rust and have a dependency on C libraries SDL2 and SDL_gfx. I don't think there would be any issues compiling for Linux or Windows, but I can't support those platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe80bc7fb50f45fd73c47c98b2f1fbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Liam O'Connor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
