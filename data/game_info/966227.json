Unleash the Havoc!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In a world threatened by an evil mega-corporation\u2019s private robot army, the last bastion of hope for mankind is a bunch of armed lunatics who signed up for a mercenary job. And who better to lead them than a disposable clone with an unpredictable set of special traits? Welcome to your new assignment, Commander.<br/><br/>Take the battle to the enemy and build your underfunded, over-ambitious outfit into an apocalyptic war machine that rids the world of evil.<br/><br/>With all chances stacked against your mercenary operation, this isn\u2019t about glory. This is about the loot!<h3>Play the genetic lottery!</h3>Every Commander is created from a set of randomly selected traits. Can you lead your squad to victory with a colorblind, megalomaniac Infiltrator? Or take on the enemy alone with a deaf, greedy One-Man Army? How about a nostalgic, vampiric Berserker?<br/><br/>Each combination of traits yields a unique run with its own set of challenges, mechanics, and surprising synergies.<br/><h3>Build your killer squad!</h3>Assemble your team of mercenaries from a roster of vigorous fighters. Each Merc totes their own arsenal and behavior. Discover their unique mechanics, and rain devastation upon your enemies.<br/><br/>Each Merc and Gear item comes with individual skill trees and powerful synergies. Keep your merc\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in mind as you pick the right gear for your team, and watch the mayhem unfold!<br/><h3>Grab the loot!</h3>Navigate the procedurally generated map in each operation and capture different objectives to call in reinforcements or sack valuable loot. But be quick, the clock is ticking. Each minute wasted on the battlefield is punished with more and stronger enemies.<br/><br/><h3>Extract or die!</h3>Call in your extraction point and defend it to make it out alive. Or survive long enough and risk facing a dangerous final boss. If you die you lose your loot, but if you survive you keep everything and gain survivor bonuses for your mercs on your next operation.<br/><br/><h3>Build your Bunker HQ!</h3>Invest your loot to hire new Mercs, research new Gear, unlock powerful upgrades, or unlock new traits for your commanders.<br/><br/><h3>No run is the same!</h3>Focus on movement, or direct your squad with tactical abilities, or actively fight in the battle \u2013 each Commander can offer a completely different play style. Experiment and find your optimal Gear-and-Merc combinations. With every map also being generated differently, no two runs will ever be the same.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>You've been the bullet hell. Now get ready to command the bullet hell!</strong><br/>Your Mercs await their Commander.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Control a Commander, generated from 3 random Traits, with thousands of unique combinations<br/></li><li>Build your squad from a large variety of Mercs with unique skill trees<br/></li><li>Select from dozens of Gear items to modify and improve your squad and Commander<br/></li><li>Conduct your Operations on distinct, procedural Maps with different mission parameters and unique Bosses<br/></li><li>Upgrade your base in between Operations with the materials you\u2019ve scavenged<br/></li><li>Full support for controllers and keyboard/mouse<br/></li><li>Stream the game with Twitch integration and let your audience decide your fate <br/></li><li>Play now on SteamDeck, full compatibility coming soon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T15:37:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a14d5451824735758c46f20b7d6581.jpg", "website": "https://www.survivormercs.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wolpertinger Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wandering Wizard"], "esrb_rating": null}
