I made this game to test out Ren\u2019Py, and I\u2019m quite happy with the result.</p>\n<p>Official website:</p>\n<p>https://houseofbill.wordpress.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52f/52f301144de2fc929756b21f27cf63c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thomasasia"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
