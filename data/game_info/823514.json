Leveraging this, <strong>RAMTEETH</strong> has built <strong>sidegate</strong> as a mod for <strong>Drift Ring Zero</strong> to break into the <strong>ourHome</strong> metaverse and reclaim their users\u2019 data. The data is retrieved from <strong>Captivate</strong>\u2019s servers and put on an anonymised distributed network, allowing secure access to <strong>ourHome</strong>\u2019s services without tracking and monitoring.  \t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\r\n \t\t\r\n \t Your job as a fresh <strong>RAMTEETH</strong> recruit is to aid the leaders and take back the data that <strong>Captivate</strong> stole.</em></p>\n<p>Models and concept art by\u00a0SCRAWN<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:42:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10b7767d827c743ec631dbbac8493ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Max Kearney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
