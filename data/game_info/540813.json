You launch cat with variable force in any direction to strike blocks with loot and abilities and crash fort walls!<br/><br/>You have slow-mo to aim, plan and be tactical.<br/><br/>Level completion usually looks like a dance between objectives and obstacles.<br/><br/>There is a companion in every level whom helps player to loot more gold coins. But she is fragile, so be careful in your destruction.</p>\n<p>Consider that your superhero style take off causes damage to target blocks and your companion.<br/><br/>Game is very easy to operate but has depth to master.</p>\n<p>Choose order to execute targets or crush everything like a monster if it is suitable. Match blocks in combo or oneshot the whole level.<br/><br/>That candy looking thing, acts like a shotgun when you crush it hard enough.<br/><br/>Survival aspect:<br/>Earn gold by demolishing blocks in the fort.<br/>Pay 88 gold for next fort.<br/>Be effective in time, hits count, combos and more to earn more gold.<br/><br/>Your progress is noted by collection of beautiful fishes on the wall inside the castle :)<br/><br/>Have fun!<br/><br/>Why cats knock things over?<br/>Maybe, so to find gold coins..</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef0a19ee072d841c85a770c2306ef08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["maxestry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
