Be careful: some NPCs want to hurt others!</p>\n<p>Oh and try to avoid the big and sharp saw, or else things could get messy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Objective</strong></p>\n<p>Currently the objective is not stated at all in the game so I am going to explain it here. There are NPCs that you start off with and these NPCs have survival requirements (currently they just die by bleeding out). Then there are hazards than can hurt your NPCs, like the saw blade and raiders.</p>\n<p>More to come, please play!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for viewing my itch page and I hope you download the game and write me feedback!</p>\n<p>It's in the very early stages, but I think it is so fun to play and feel like this game idea has great potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Play Notes</strong></p>\n<p>For some reason the rotate speed of the camera gets slower the lower you put the graphics settings when launching the game. Don't fret, though: you can use you keypad's + to increase it! (and - to decrease)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd111ed527eae9d73d61e4a17916e3e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Machineman1357"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
