{"id": 513793, "slug": "disc-wielder", "name": "Disc Wielder", "name_original": "Disc Wielder", "description": "<p>DISC WIELDER is a game about fighting things in rooms with a disc.</p>\n<p>You play as CARPATHIA, amateur disc wielder, as she ventures into the dangerous DEMON KEEP to save her friend and close the portal.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Arrow Keys to Move</p>\n<p>Z to Select / Attack</p>\n<p>X to Cancel / Special</p>\n<p>C to Focus</p>\n<p>Esc to Pause<br/></p>\n<p>All rebind-able in the menu.</p>\n\r\nDIFFICULTY\r\n<p>There are\u00a0several\u00a0options\u00a0to\u00a0adjust\u00a0the\u00a0difficulty.</p>\n<p>Inf Lives allows for infinite restarting at checkpoints.</p>\n<p>Inf Ability allows for your selected ability to used even when out of cards, albeit at a small cooldown. <br/></p>\n<p>Game Jams being how they are, the difficulty isn't perfectly tuned. Hopefully these can get you where you need to be.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also practice any stage or boss from the practice menu, although if you play out of order you may encounter story spoilers. You will also see all the bosses if you play the Boss Rush mode.<br/></p>\n\r\nNOTES\r\n<p>The game resolution is very small, so you will probably want to resize the window, or go into the settings and enable fullscreen. Navigate the menus using Arrow Keys + Z + X.<br/></p>\n<p>You pick an ability before entering the game. The Flash Ability clears the screen of all bullets. The Disc Ability launches three discs out as projectiles.<br/></p>\n<p>When Focused you can see your hitbox highlighted in purple and you move slower.</p>\n<p>Disc Wielder is designed to be a bullet hell game with an emphasis on careful attacks. Don't spam, and make sure to hit as many enemies as you can.<br/></p>\n<p>Every bullet type makes different splatters when it kills you, and every enemy makes a different splatter when killed. Where the enemies hit the disc effects the splatters. This was probably not worth the effort I put into it.<br/></p>\n<p>The character portraits were generated using machine learning. I am not that good of an artist.</p>\n<p>You can unlock special dialogue by beating the game without dying. It's not much, but I did want a little reward for the player.<br/></p>\n<p>My time records are 7m 34.76s to beat the story mode, and 1m 41.30s to beat the boss rush. <br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think could be improved, or if you find any bugs. Lots of both I'm sure.<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>All Code and Visuals made by thedashdude from Oct 16 to Oct 31 for the Disc Room Game Jam.</p>\n<p>All music taken from Cor Metallicum by OZZED.</p>\n<p>Sound Effects made by thedashdude, plus some splatters provided by\u00a0doseone's jam audio pack.</p>\n<p>The source for the entire project can be downloaded from GitHub.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:58:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbede88edf4cfeec7edc4b495d60590a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thedashdude"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
