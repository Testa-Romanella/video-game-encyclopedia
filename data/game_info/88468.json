Where are you going? <br/> <br/>To complete this initiatory journey, you must use both your observational skills and your imagination. You will follow various types of arrows, which are either obvious or hidden in graphic illusions. <br/> <br/>Surprised by an illusion, swept along by a storm, flying above infinite towns, you will be able to lose yourself and then find your way easily, but not without questions. <br/> <br/>Available for Samsung Gear, Oculus and Cardboard, the experience can also be played without a headset, using the touch screen of your mobile phone or tablet.<br/> <br/>The experience is made up of 3 chapters, each lasting approximately 10 minutes. <br/> <br/>A UNIQUE GRAPHIC UNIVERSE<br/>Beautiful black and white graphics, faithfully adapted from Marc-Antoine Mathieu\u2019s graphic novel, will allow you to enjoy a deep and minimalist aesthetic experience outside of the norm. <br/> <br/>INTUITIVE NAVIGATION<br/>Slide your smartphone into the headset and let us guide you. No controller is needed. You interact through sight.<br/> <br/>AN IMMERSIVE SOUNDTRACK<br/>The spatialized sound further immerses you in this absurd universe and the music carries the limits of your imagination even further. An audio headset is recommended for an optimal experience.<br/><br/>Recommended for Iphone 6, Ipad 4, Ipad 5<br/><br/>***<br/> Emotional Games Awards 2016 : VR category [Laval]<br/> Selection at the Tribeca Film Festival 2016 [New York]<br/> Selection at the VR Summit, in the \"artistic direction\u201d category [Los Angeles]<br/> Selection at the Magic Festival [Monaco]<br/> ***<br/><br/><br/><br/>Website  : arte.tv/sens<br/>Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/creative.arte<br/>Twitter : https://twitter.com/ARTEcreative<br/>Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/arte_creative\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49ea6ea94121b3a14b85459004e57d51.jpg", "website": "http://arte.tv/sens", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["ARTE Experience"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["ARTE France Apps"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
