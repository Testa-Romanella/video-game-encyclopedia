I haven't done any testing on mobile.<br/></p>\n<p>This game and all assets were made in a weekend for Jamingtons 6.0. This project explores the use of various media to support interactive fiction. The loops for the video and audio are crude and not seamless - but work for demonstrating the concept.</p>\n<p>The project was made using Vue.js, which is\u00a0commonly used as a reactive user interface framework. Inspiration was drawn from the Twine engine.\u00a0 A primary goal of this project was to create a\u00a0Vue.js boilerplate project that replicated the functionality in the Twine engine.</p>\n<p>Jam disclaimer: I didn't start this project from scratch. I began with a boiler plate I made a week prior (see git log).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f097f635093694d777e9743eb16b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["altru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
