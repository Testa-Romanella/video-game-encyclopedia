Due to popular demand, I have decided to upload it to itch.io. It is a game created with RPG Maker MV and is currently only available in Simplified Chinese.\r\n</p>\r\nDo you have any plans to translate this game?\r\n\r\n<p>I am not sure at the moment, but I am leaning more towards No. I am personally not a big fan of this game myself, and it was not originally part of my plan to make it available to download. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the game does have pros as well! However, I believe it no longer represents my characters and myself.\r\n</p>\r\nIs the game still canon?\r\n\r\n<p>No. Although I did make a few references to this game in \u201cVincent: The Secret of Myers\u201d for the older fanbase, the game is no longer canon. I see the current\u201cVincent: The Secret of Myers\u201d as the revamped version of this game.\r\n</p>\r\nDo you allow reuploads of your game?\r\n\r\n<p>No. If you have \u201cVincent: Phantom of G4\u201d shared in your group chat or on your personal drive, please take it down! The only games that I allow reuploading at the moment are fan-translated versions of Therapy with Dr. Albert Krueger. Thank you for your understanding!\r\n</p>\r\nAnd remember, please check out Vincent: The Secret of Myers before downloading this game!\r\n\r\n!!!Please Read Page Description Before Downloading!!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T04:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/50491f97e7cbeba0a2e83b178b346bd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dino999z"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
