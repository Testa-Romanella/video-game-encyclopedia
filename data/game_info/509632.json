You decide to climb the tower, because... you can.</p>\r\nGameplay Notes:\r\n<ul><li>You can use <strong>WASD</strong> as well as the arrow keys</li><li>You can jump with\u00a0<strong>W</strong>, <strong>\u25b2</strong>, or<strong> [SPACE]</strong></li><li>Jump height is determined by the length of the button press</li><li>You can jump through the bottoms of moving platforms</li></ul>\r\nDevelopment Notes:\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My original idea involved unlocking a character after \"climbing the tower\", with each character having a unique ability to play with.\u00a0 This would have given the player an objective goal to work towards, but as it stands the game is mostly just a test of skill. I hope it's fun enough as-is.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>0x72 for character/enviroment assets<ul><li>Link</li></ul></li><li>Mystery Attic for UI assets<ul><li>link</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:38:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/60725b56e2a78ffdbdcd164569878086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orangefire Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
