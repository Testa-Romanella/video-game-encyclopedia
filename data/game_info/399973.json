From there on, you find yourself trapped in a quite unfortunate situation. In order to escape, you have to uncover the secrets of RupTure.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Work your way through a dystopian world that only turns darker.</em></p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can interact with many objects to unfold the story and learn details about the world of RupTure. Move with WASD or the arrow keys and explore your surroundings with help of your mouse. Moving the cursor over objects will (in most cases) indicate if you can interact with them. I recommend playing with sound.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Some infos</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I developed this game in my spare time during the last few months. Currently, RupTure is a demo with a playtime of around 20 to 30 minutes, but I plan to complete the game next year. I want to tell an interesting and complex  story and hope that you will like my demo version so far.<br/></p>\n<p>If you decide to play it, I would be very grateful if you commented your opinion on RupTure, as this is my first ever gaming project and I hope to learn as much as possible from your feedback :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5fc72f102c581189cb564bc19255616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lauato"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
