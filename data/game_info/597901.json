It has 5 levels, all varying in difficulty.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>To play, simply select your platform and download the zip file that applies. Extract it and play!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>BEWARE!\u00a0There are some bugs in this game... it was made in only 45 hours by one person. The bugs are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Something the player character's animation glitches out. To fix this just move in the opposite direction.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>On Level 4, the ai Eagle sometimes pushes you into a collider. To fix this just restart the level. AI is complicated to code and this was just unaccounted for in the code for it.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Like mentioned before, AI is hard to code so the mosquito on Level 5 might push you into a collider as well (It's not too common). Same as before... just restart the level.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, the transition from Level 4 to Level 5 is messed up. While it works in Unity, it does not when exporting the game. This seems to be a bug in Unity, but I might just be dumb. Just exit the game and use the level selection to select Level 5.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>While bugs mess up the game and ruin the fun, remember that I only had 40 hours, and was completed by just one person. I hate to leave it like this with bugs unfixed, but if you want to see more, drop some ideas in the comments below.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This project contains lots of complicated\u00a0shaders and complicated AI scripts, please be advised that it is a big folder and takes up quite a bit of space. I wanted to have it run in WebGL, but the project was too complicated to render correctly.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>This project was created for\u00a0</strong><strong>Spring 2D Jam 2021</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Nikita Chernin- Game Designer/Programmer</p>\n<p>Jacob\u00a0Hallberg- Music Designer/Composer</p>\n<p>Assets used from Ansimuz, Minkiz, Kauzz,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jan Schneider, Elthen,\u00a0Trixie\u00a0and Nikita Chernin.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:48:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8fede6564e57a20449760b9a508dc64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NikitaChernin", "Jacob Hallberg"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
