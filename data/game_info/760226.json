{"id": 760226, "slug": "hatcher-tabletop-dice", "name": "Hatcher Tabletop Dice", "name_original": "Hatcher Tabletop Dice", "description": "<p>Made with RPG Pen &amp; Paper Players in mind, Hatcher Dice has been used countless times across Flash and Android since 2013. Containing a variety of different dice you might need, Hatcher Dice has you covered. If you want to roll the dice solo or with friends for fun, you can do that too!\r\n</p>\n<p>There are super handy heads/tails, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sided dice (and up to 999 \"sides\"!) that you can have all on one screen for Dungeon/Game Masters to utilize. Or, if you just need one kind of dice, you can go to just that one's screen and roll away! There is also the \"near infinite\" customizable amount \"dice\" of 1-999 that you can choose and roll.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>This app has also been a decent companion app</strong>\u00a0to Tabletop Simulator and similar digital games. Multiple card and board game designers have used it while prototyping too! :)<br/></p>\n<p>The roll log keeps up with the most recent rolls, and you can wipe them out anytime, or it will reset on its own once you have too many in the log.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hatcher Dice is the PC version \"restored\" from the old Flash and Android versions, modified for the PC. Since Flash apps and games are harder to acquire and/or enjoy, we wanted to bring this app to itch.io from 2013.<br/></p>\n<p>Made by a much younger Hatcher child in 2013, the app may be rough around the edges here and there, but is pretty functional. Frame rate and timing of animations have been improved as well. The background and heads/tails art was swapped in with Jabriel's newer artwork that we enjoy a lot. The glowing background dice on graph paper photo is from his trip in California in 2013 as he was developing it and we were testing it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game, graphics, and sound are Copyright 2013, 2022 Jabriel Hatcher/Hatcher Technomantics.
