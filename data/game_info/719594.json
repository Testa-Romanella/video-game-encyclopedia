At the time of TRUFFLE releasing I am a college student and I create games in my free time. This is my 4th full Steam game. TRUFFLE is also a complete remake of my first game with over double the content and made in an entirely new game engine. This game is completely free because I want as many people as possible to be able to play and enjoy the game I worked very hard on!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T06:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b8f149a3e68267b89d682a167fbe54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 57, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Robichaux"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mink Game Studios", "Vultive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
