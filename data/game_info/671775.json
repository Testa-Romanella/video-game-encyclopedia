This is what I call a \"utility\" based card game where rather than playing units to defend yourself, you instead attack the opposing player directly with your cards.\u00a0While you may start with only 500 HP, that is not the maximum. To keep things simple each player can only play one card a turn.</p><p>This was originally going to be a team project where I was mostly going to be the artist and a friend was going to do the bulk of the programming. Unfortunately things came up and they never got an opportunity to work on it. Its a shame that most of my art has gone unused but please enjoy what I scrapped together in the final days.<br/></p><p>Made using GB Studio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11d/11d89b4dd425a72bd103327f34ba68f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kermit da Snek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
