There are 3 levels to put your speed, control and attention to the test. Mind you, controlling the ball is tricky! You have to maintain your speed but should not get carried away with it. Drive as fast as possible but don't loose control! Also be mindful of red fireflies on the tracks which will try to push you off course.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05ed00cdb5918ddd0ab58ea30cf33b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potato Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Potato Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
