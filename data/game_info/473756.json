The game begins at a failed space mission in the exosphere of earth, and our character is left with no choice but to put on a parachute and jump towards earth. The character will then be in freefall towards earth, and will have to dodge obstacles. The game never ends and gets tougher and tougher. The player\u2019s incentive would be to break high scores, like any other arcade game.</p>\n<p><strong>Character:</strong><br/>The only character of the game is our player a tiny non-realistic astronaut. He is scared to death and doesn\u2019t want to hit a piece of debris at 500 miles/hr.<br/><br/><strong>Goal:</strong><br/>To avoid obstacles and fall for as long as possible.<br/>Rules<br/>1) The player can control the character by tilting the phone(using phone's Gyroscope).<br/>2) The player can only survive for as long as the oxygen tank has oxygen in it. The player hence needs to collect oxygen which will appear frequently as a collectible and replenish the tank.<br/>3) The player can also collect other collectibles such as a time contractor, a score multiplier, armor, etc.<br/>4) The player\u2019s speed of falling will keep on increasing as he drops, making the game more challenging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:28:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5857e2bcaddd050e3eeee054603616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Studio Centauri", "OM3GA64", "debosen", "Saral-code", "Abhiagar", "shalvin04", "dxaman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
