Originally it was planned for Mobile, but we figured with some redesign it might be awesome for PC too due to the challenging but at the same time chill gameplay <em>(which is awesome for some puzzle fun at cozy evenings)</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>\n<p>Portal Golf is a 2D Puzzle Adventure Game where an inexperienced\u00a0golfer tries his best to hit a hole in one using magical portals. As you will find out pretty quickly, he's... not quite good. Luckily, he's got a great guy with him who appears to be a magical Djinn. The Djinn, whom you are playing, is a great guy and always happy to help new players to make some progress!\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the Levels and find some challenge! If you want to try it out on your Android phone, there's also a Google Play version which you can find below.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Give us your amazing feedback!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Feel free to <strong>share your thoughts on the project!</strong>\r\nWe're happy to hear what you think and wish for! :P</p>\n<p>Alright, enough talking. Hope you have a great time playing or scrolling itch for more awesome games! See you around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T02:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11ae509073a93c9fd0ece4fe1b6a7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PandaBee Studios"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
