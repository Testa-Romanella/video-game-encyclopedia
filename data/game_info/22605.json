Over a century has passed since his last appearance, and now all eyes are on the Dungeon, eager to claim a share of the spoils within.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are an Explorer, leading a team of mercenaries (Knights, sorcerers, and monsters of all kinds) to plunder whatever treasures are hidden in the depths of the Dungeon. But beware! You are not the only one who has had the same idea\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dungeon of Zaar is inspired by classic tactical games such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars and by great strategy games such as Warhammer, Pok\u00e9mon and Magic the Gathering. Nevertheless, the game is different from your standard tactical-RPG, we want it to be focused only on strategic decisions and fast paced PvP combat. <br/><br/><br/>Players will create their own Dungeon Explorer and take part in intense online battles against other Explorers or play local hot seat mode with their friends around one computer.<br/><br/>Explorers don't come alone into the Dungeon. They are the brains, but not the brawn! They are escorted by a squad of Mercenaries recruited from around the Kingdom to protect them and help them forge onward.<br/><br/>One of our goals is to put a strong emphasis on creativity in team building and let the players find new innovative strategies. Players will have the freedom to play the composition they want and try many fun team combinations. Explorers will be able to associate each troop with any other one, there are tons of possibilities, combos and crazy tactics to try!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fighting in the dungeon grants Explorers experience points and random rewards to claim after the battle, such as ancient forgotten weapons, magical gears, or crafting materials used to forge new consumables and equipment ready to use in the next battles, allowing for even more team customization.<br/><br/>At launch, all mercenaries will be available to play from the start, but Explorers will begin their adventure only with a few basic items, the rest will be up to them to discover and craft! There is no adventure without a little challenge!<br/><br/><br/>We also want to blend multiplayer gameplay with traditional solo RPG features. Most PvP games don\u2019t integrate the lore of the game into their gameplay as we have. In Dungeon of Zaar players are \u00ab Explorers \u00bb of the dungeon, they will be able to choose their physical attributes and the goals of their quest. Explorers will also gain experience in combat, level up to unlock new outfits and rewards, craft and use items. We want players to feel that they are personally on a journey to the heart of a dangerous Castle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players can recruit a wide range of mercenaries coming from around the kingdom. Powerful mages, righteous knights or weird monsters, it\u2019s up to you to choose your troops and build your strategy the way you like. Each mercenary has its own strengths and weaknesses with unique gameplay and abilities.<br/><br/>A typical mercenary team is composed of 5 mercenaries and you can pick two times the same kind of troop to maximize you tactic! We aim to offer at least 15 mercenaries at the time of game release. <br/><br/><br/>Each mercenary has simple attributes: Damage output, Health points and Movement, and powerful unique abilities like magical spells, special attacks and morphology atributes. We try to make each mercenary original, easy to understand an use. They can all have a huge impact on the battlefield and can be useful in numerous situations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Dungeon skirmishes can take place everywhere, from the gates of the Castle, the Courtyard Garden, to the Library, each map has a unique layout with particular look and features.<br/><br/>One of the things we want to push forward is \u00ab Map events \u00bb, each map will have a special gameplay feature that players will be able to use to their advantage whether it\u2019s a drawbridge activated by an attackable pillar, an empowering rune, burning tiles or dangerous spikes trap.<br/><br/>Each arena will also feature \u00ab loot bags \u00bb. Those bags magically pop on the arena after a few turns and are here to give an advantage to players who takes more risks! Each bag contain powerful items to use during the battle, they can give you a bonus or help you recover from your mistakes.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Explorers didn\u2019t come to the Dungeon with empty pockets! Potions, armor pieces, fairy powder and other charms grants additional power to their mercenaries.<br/><br/>Before entering the Dungeon, customize your strategy by choosing between multiple items you looted or crafted. In the game all items have the same \"potential strenght\", players with more crafted items will not be stronger than the ones who just started the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After a first turn used only to deploy mercenaries on the starting areas, mercenaries will be able to fight!<br/><br/>Each competitor plays all the mercenaries of his team during his turn in the order he wishes, then gives the hand to his opponent. You can move and attack with every troop you own in any order without any speed, initiative or action points constraints, that makes the gameplay really flexible.<br/><br/>Each turn players are allowed to use one item, may it be equipping a Cursed Blade or using a Health Potion. To win the fight, you have to slay three mercenaries of the enemy team before you loose three of yours!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0a9987a15435e877dee4315de7a5a91.jpg", "website": "http://dungeonofzaar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 135, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KURB"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KURB"], "esrb_rating": null}
