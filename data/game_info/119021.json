Simply drag and drop it somewhere into your phone and use the file or folder search to find the .apk and install it! <br/>Please note that you may need developer controls enabled to access such functionality and it is worth googling how to do this for your phone. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f9461f2c6f67de863c37783d720824b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Jones"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
