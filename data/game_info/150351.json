The theme was <em>ancient technology</em>.</p>\n<p>One of our least polished LD entries ever, but uploading with the rest of the LD games for the sake of it, since the gameplay itself is still quite amusing. No music (but sound effects), and the match never ends, so you'll have to make up your own rules~</p>\n<p>Two players only,\u00a0\u00a0and unfortunately needs at least one gamepad (preferably two for a fair game), but one player can use a keyboard.<br/></p>\n<p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&amp;uid=6155</p>\n<p>Bring your favourite friend (or sworn enemy, if you're the kind of person to have one of those) and play a friendly (or enemyly) game of Atlantean Hockey! The rules are simple; score points! Use power-ups! Tackle the other team! And beware of the every ticking time bomb that is the puck!\u00a0\ud83d\udca3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a25313580b582b5ed3dfc15a314d78b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prinsessa"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
