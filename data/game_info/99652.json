Jump your way through this retro-style platformer to obtain 7 crystals located in 7 levels! 7 may seem like not much but our levels are very gamboyey which makes it ok!

Anyways enjoy! </p><p>So this is my first time entering a game Jam so any feedback would be gr8!</p><p>All graphics and coding were done by me in Game Maker Studio and Paint.Net.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dce/dce6ebe44e890ee18aceb337b52060b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MaxODidily"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
