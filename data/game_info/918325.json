The one that people or strangers see, and the one that my friends and I see. Both sides of the composition are structured as tiny exhibitions displaying parts of myself.\u00a0On one side, you can see\u00a0my diploma, my projects, and what people see on my social media, this is showed in a simple, black and white view. The other side shows another view of my life, the colors on the wall and floor\u00a0are vivid and vibrant. Around the two parts of this exhibit there are many tall buildings representing my environment. The green and purple lights reflecting on the buildings show how I present myself to my connections and surroundings.\u00a0The whole composition is inside a transparent globe that represents how this is only one life encapsulated in an immense world, represented by the endless sky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T09:21:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d99e8d11e746af310a9ba4ba2dd7e845.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kergt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
