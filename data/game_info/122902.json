Wielding the ability to see sound, you can utilize echolocation to make sounds to see your surroundings. However, the monsters that roam the maze are attracted to sound, and will hunt you down. You may use items that generate sound to distract these monsters. Avoid the monsters, escape the subway, and perhaps you\u2019ll discover what had transpired here and your reason for being here.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:<br/></strong>Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:<br/></strong>Utilize the joysticks to move. The right joystick controls your rotation, while the left joystick controls your movement. Hold down the left trigger to run, pull the right trigger to toss a rock/soda can to show you the way! Run out of throwables? Snap your fingers by pushing the right thumbstick like a button. Press 'A' to jump over obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Members<br/></strong>Game Designer - Emmanuel Yuan<br/>Assistant Game Designer - Tee Anderson<br/>Programmer - Dylan Montgomery<br/>Programmer - Andre Ghanima<br/>Programmer - Harald Pederstad<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets<br/></strong>Skeleton - PBR - Animated - Low Poly (LUGIA GAMES)<br/>True Horror - Crawler (WITCH-A-TWIN STUDIOS)<br/>Urban Underground (GABROS MEDIA)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/9945187cac7fd840897ad70cd8eada99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Student Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
