Tank Pig has a lot of health as well as quite an arsenal:\u00a0 a machine gun,\u00a0 guided rockets, and cannon.\r\nWhen outside of Tank Pig, the fragile Pilot has a much higher jump and \u00a0a short range shotgun, but still has remote\u00a0access to Tank Pig\u2019s machine gun and rocket launcher. So you can give yourself direct fire support.\r\n</li><li><strong>INTENSE RUN &amp; GUN ACTION:\u00a0</strong>Blast through hordes of mutants, robots, and giant bosses\u00a0in this chaotic action platformer.\r\n</li><li><strong>UNIQUE PUZZLE PLATFORMING:\u00a0</strong>You'll have to use both characters and your wits to navigate these challenge levels. Violence isn't always the answer (but it sure does help).\r\n</li><li><strong>DEATH ISN'T THE END:</strong> It's a game mechanic. Sometimes there's nowhere else to go but towards your own demise, knowing that you can simply respawn at Tank Pig to continue. If at first you don't succeed, die again!</li><li><strong>BEAUTIFUL AND STRANGE WORLD:\u00a0</strong>Explore a quirky and twisted post human world full of mutants, robots and other horrors, all rendered in adorably terrifying pixel art.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>PROTOTYPE</strong></p>\n<p>Tank Pig is still in very\u00a0early development. We have nailed down the art style and have zeroed in on an an interesting set of core mechanics. BUT we are still experimenting and growing and a lot is subject to change as we move forward.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Mouse and Keyboard Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>WAD to move\r\n</li><li>Mouse to aim\r\n</li><li>ESC to return to menu\r\n</li><li>Right Click to fire rockets from Tank Pig\r\n</li><li>Hold Right Click to guide rockets\r\n</li><li>Left Click to fire the machine gun\r\n</li><li>Spacebar to fire Tank\u00a0Pig's cannon\r\n</li><li>Jump on top of Tank Pig and press E to enter Tank\u00a0Pig\r\n</li><li>E to Exit Tank pig\r\n</li><li>E to respawn if Pilot killed\r\n</li><li>Hold E next to Tank Pig to repair Tank Pig\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gamepad Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick to move\r\n</li><li>Right Joystick to aim\r\n</li><li>Start/Menu to return to menu\r\n</li><li>Left Trigger to fire rockets from Tank\u00a0Pig\r\n</li><li>Hold Left Trigger to guide rockets\r\n</li><li>Right Trigger to fire the machine gun\r\n</li><li>Right Bumper to fire Tank Pig's cannon\r\n</li><li>Jump on top of Tank Pig and press Y to enter Tank\u00a0Pig\r\n</li><li>Y to Exit tank pig\r\n</li><li>Y to respawn if Pilot killed\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Hold Y next to Tank Pig to repair Tank Pig</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T17:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/43119c42c720c16a5f4d01289897a634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Possum House Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
