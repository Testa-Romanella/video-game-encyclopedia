Except in this game they're<br/>green because Graham liked it better that way, and who am I to argue.</p>\n<p>Easy mode shows you where the enemy cars are. Normal mode, doesn't and also has more cars. Hard\u00a0<br/>mode is just a bit harder. You can only upload your highscore when not in easy mode.</p>\n<p>Mini-Games<br/>----------<br/>Race: various race type games that are either against the computer, time trials or beat the clock<br/>Quiz: can you navigate to a U.S. state given the state's name? or perhaps given just it's capital?<br/>Survivor: stay alive as long as possible</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f99e620c227449697aa1a08c464d31d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Retroreloader @ Return learn games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
