{"id": 851067, "slug": "space-beauties", "name": "Space Beauties", "name_original": "Space Beauties", "description": "<p>Space Beauties is a slightly challenging puzzle game with 35 pieces and 12 playable levels. In the game, you need to swap tiles in places to complete the image, as all the fragments will stand correctly, you will receive a notification that the game has been completed, and after 5 seconds you will move to a new level. In this version, there is no transition to a new level if you have not completed the current level. The game includes one hint with which to simply start the game, the lower right fragment is marked with the \"GameREA\" logo. You won't be able to start the game from any level either. When you pass the level, the password for this level will be written at the bottom of the panel, from which you can start the game if you enter it on the passwords tab, which is located in the menu. The game is colorful and I hope you enjoy this format. Good luck to everyone in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f13436ba2cc7b2f30030489eb75f34e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameREA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
