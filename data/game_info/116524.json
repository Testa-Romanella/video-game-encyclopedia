This is indicated by an icon on their head, and on the side of the interface. Each 'slot' on the left is for a specific customer. In it you can see how much they're willing to pay for the item, how much you will get fined if you fail to deliver, and their patience, in form of a slider.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs the customers get more impatient, they'll start offering less and less for the item they requested, so make sure you hurry up! Should their patience completely deplete, they'll storm out of the shop, forcing you to pay a penalty.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou have several Dwarves at your disposal: a Smelter, a Smith, a Leatherworker, a Carpenter and a Master Crafter. Go close to them to see what they can craft!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCrude GIF tutorial for how to craft. No mouse needed. More details in the help menu:\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tEnjoy and please contact me for feedback and concerns!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPS: will add audio at a later date. Ran out of time.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad692b1c91d8639ecd6ba8b5067080a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Malsanity"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
