(Submission page)<br/><br/>Wellspring Wanderer was written in Scala using the especially excellent libGDX game development framework (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). Levels and plant life are randomly and procedurally generated. Non-procedural art was crafted lovingly in the GIMP. I used Propellerhead's Reason, my fingers, and a number of piano keys for the music.<br/><br/>All art, sounds, words, music and code were created by Justin Mullin during the 48 hours of the Ludum Dare #34 competition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c77d8e48a7ac6d17d618a7e094a8fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Justin Mullin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
