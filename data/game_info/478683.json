{"id": 478683, "slug": "the-scaredragon", "name": "The ScareDragon", "name_original": "The ScareDragon", "description": "<p>A player is the hero of this kingdom, chasing dragons away from the homeland. There's no violence, only fun, because dragons are afraid of charming heroes of course. The player's mission is to dodge boxes to be able to force the dragon away. As the player unlocks more and more realms the game gets faster. On the other hand, as the player gains experience and levels, the game gets slower.<br/>The ScareDragon is great for casual players.\u00a0You can play whenever you want, there's no stress. The player can open a free gift every 3 hours, so if you don't rush and relax a bit, the game actually rewards you.<br/>Also, the player can unlock special armors by completing achievements and then show prestige by wearing extra colored plates.</p>\n<strong>FAQ</strong>\n<strong>The game\u00a0is\u00a0free,\u00a0is\u00a0there\u00a0any\u00a0annoying\u00a0ads?</strong>\n<p>No, there is no ads! Only the potion shop is not available in the free version. And supporters who buy the full version will also get special armor.<br/></p>\n<strong>itch.io wants money from me,but you said it's free!</strong>\n<p>Just click on \"no thanks, just take me to downloads\" and enjoy :)<br/></p>\n<strong>Why is game not on </strong><strong>Google Play?</strong>\n<p>I am working on it. I need to get a license and the validation of the app will take some time too, so please be patient. I'm sorry that playing on the phone is now a bit uncomfortable.<br/></p>\n<strong>Credits (used assets)</strong>\n<br/>Character:<br/>\r\nhttps://goglilol.itch.io/<p>Dragon:<br/>https://sr-studios-kerala.itch.io/baby-dragon-pixelerated<br/>\n</p><p>Music: <br/>https://timbeek.itch.io/silly-orchestrals</p><p>Tiles:<br/>\r\nhttps://www.gameart2d.com/</p><p>Backgrounds:<br/>https://craftpix.net/<br/></p><p>Sounds: <br/>https://www.kenney.nl/assets\r\n<br/>https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/331381/\r\n<br/>https://timbeek.itch.io/casual-soundfx-pack<br/></p>Fonts:<p>https://www.ceskefonty.cz/ceske-fonty/baveuse<br/>https://www.fontspace.com/fairy-playground-font-f45497</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69c87c8a00324319b4b5d82a612b4a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Pandemon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
