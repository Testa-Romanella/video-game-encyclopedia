It uses\u00a0SquidLib\u00a0for certain calculations, as well as my own libraries, APWT\u00a0and MaugriftUtils. Being made in Java, the game is available as a cross-platform jar file. There is, however, an\u00a0exe-wrapped version for Windows, in case you do not have Java installed.</p><p><em>Note that there is a bug in this version where attempting to land on a nonexistent planet crashes the game. This is fixed in the latest\u00a0experimental build.</em><br/></p>\r\nSupport\r\n<p>EverSector is provided for free, but donations are much appreciated.
