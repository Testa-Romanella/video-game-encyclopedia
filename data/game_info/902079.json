It takes place on a two-dimensional grid in which cells can be \u2018on\u2019 (alive) or \u2018off\u2019 (dead), and is defined by a set of rules that jointly determine the state of a cell given the state of its neighbours. Following specification of an initial configuration, patterns evolve over time across the grid requiring no further user input (thus \u2018zero-player\u2019).<br/></p>\n<p>One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules or conditions of the Game of Life:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2) Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3) All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</strong></p>\n<p>P.S. This is just a short project I took up today since I was bored :P. Have fun creating patterns and watching them evolve.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T08:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/809/809be9830d426a5fa29aea4019439d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nitheesh Pillai"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
