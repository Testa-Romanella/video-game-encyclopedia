The goal is to <br/>\r\nUnlock all the levels to get your sandwich back! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you\u2019ll be confronting Buffy at an abandoned construction site that is three levels <br/>\r\nLong. Buffy will try to retaliate by throwing barrels at you, so it is your job to make your way <br/>\r\nExpectantly through the level, dodge barrels, and get your sandwich back from Buffy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne thing that adds to this difficulty is that  if you die on any of the levels, it will send you <br/>\r\n6 frustration points higher back to the start of the game. To help with your sanity, there are only<br/>\r\n3 levels in the game.
