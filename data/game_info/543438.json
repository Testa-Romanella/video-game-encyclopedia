If only you knew the pain and suffering that was to come!<br/>You pop the game in and begin to play......minutes before you destroy the controller.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>-Endless Gameplay<br/>-Stunning Retro Visuals<br/>-Easy Controls<br/>-Challenge<br/>-Hours Of Music<br/>-Free!<br/><br/>This game is EA so it is not 100% finished and may get updates. The game\u00a0does not contain any cut scenes or any fancy new stuff you see in games today. The game is a endless runner that is only meant to push a real true gamer to the limits. The goal is to get the highest score against your friends. RR is not a online multiplayer that would not make since. However you play and share your score and have your friends try to beat it.\u00a0<br/>The game is EXTREMELY HARD! and takes serious gaming skills to get the best scores.\u00a0<br/><br/>I created this to give a retro old school feeling and bring back something that is dying....The high score.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99bd6b0ddbf4c66039bf04691195ea2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AllKnightrGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
