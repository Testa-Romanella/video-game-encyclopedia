Look around.</strong><strong>Start moving.</strong><strong>Pick the key.</strong>\u00a0<strong>Open the rainbow door.</strong><strong>Run through. Repeat.</strong>\n<p>You control RED using the arrow keys and you can\u00a0run faster by maintaining the space bar. I will add joystick support in the next version.<br/></p>\r\nAuthors and licenses\r\n<p>AMSTRED was programmed in C &amp; ASM using our own AMOK engine. No libraries were used.
