I have been learning Unity on my off-time for four years now and am finally publishing my first game to Steam. Last year I made several mods for the game Endless Legend, and even made a Youtube channel teaching people how to mod the game. I will try to update the game as frequently as I can, but that all depends on the amount of work I have.<h3>Future Plans</h3>I plan to add a story to this, as well as add more music and better graphics. As for the gameplay, I plan to add RPG elements to make the game more dynamic. I also plan to improve the AI so that enemies can dodge bullets. Technically that is a feature already, but because there are many bullets on the screen, the AI doesnt have enough time to dodge all of them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T02:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cecd95c30466d8b09fd3f87755d1b0e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Avila"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Justin Avila"], "esrb_rating": null}
