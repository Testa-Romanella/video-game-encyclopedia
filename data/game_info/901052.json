There are brief mentions of abuse, suicide and incest. These themes are unapologetically presented but not condoned. Their assessment and analysis is left up to the individual player.<br/></p>\n<p>Remake of the first half of the first schlo visual novel: what is schlo? which was released in late 2018. The story is mostly unedited, but the dating sim element has been removed. There are still story choices, but it doesn't affect the ending. Completely new artwork and soundtrack.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce4db74d7150b3a43dd4a7b37f48b76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["krt_org"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
