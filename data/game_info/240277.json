This game is more in-depth than that. <br/>Here you have to earn money by winning different benchmark competitions, completing orders from people to assemble them a PC and achieving even greater results by overclocking your parts. You can buy a bigger variety of parts from e-shop but it will be more expensive to buy here than in your local shop or you can wait until those parts will arrive to your local shop. In this game there are over 400+ parts that are unlocked by progressing through a calendar. In PC Architect\u2019s alternate universe PC building scene is taken over by Kintel, Rvidia, RMD and Ai. <br/><br/>We still have a lot planned for this game and we will keep improving this PC building experience.<br/>if you have any questions, suggestions or just want to chat with us and other architects join our PC Architect discord group: https://discordapp.com/invite/officialpcarchitect<br/>If you want to follow our progress you can read our devblogs at:<br/>http://www.pc-architect.com/<br/><br/>or follow us on: <br/>Facebook(https://www.facebook.com/GamesFromGarage/)<br/>Instagram(https://www.instagram.com/games_from_garage/)<br/>Twitter(https://twitter.com/GamesFromGarage)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a43318a918e74fe862f8823caed213c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Linas Sinickas"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Linas Sinickas"], "esrb_rating": null}
