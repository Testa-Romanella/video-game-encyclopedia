I'm a solo developer who has been working day and night for over 2 years on this project. If you like the demo please think about donating to help show appreciation and support.\u00a0 For the small group of people already following this project I was only promising a small arena fighter, but I am strong believer in under promising and over delivering so here we are! I want to deliver the best possible experience I can when I release the full paid version so your thoughts and impressions(and bug reports) really mean a lot to me. Too many games today are release in half finished state which is why I am releasing this as a free demo to help iron out all the issues that come up before moving on to the full scale world development. I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>This game is still very early in development so expect bugs and such!</p>\n\n<p><strong>**Only for oculus headset(with pc) at the moment. I only have an oculus and I can't find many people who own the other brands. So if you have a non oculus device please let me know so I can get a working version all set up!</strong></p>\r\n\r\nCore Mechanics:\r\n<ul><li>Full physics Npc/Character Controller</li><li>Full physics blocking and swordplay!<br/>\n</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>*Tip: blocking works best when done closest to the hilt of the sword</p>\n\n<ul><li>Full Physics climbing</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Health\u00a0 and Climbing Stamina\u00a0 UI is displayed on your left hand</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Force Grab: Aim hand at item you wish to force grab.
