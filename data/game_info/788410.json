{"id": 788410, "slug": "oh-how-do-i-breathe", "name": "Oh how do i breathe?", "name_original": "Oh how do i breathe?", "description": "<p>\"Oh, how do i breathe?\" is a short narrative VR experience telling the story of a submarine captain. The captain wakes up to the sounds of an alarm playing through his submarine as it travels through water. What would this problem be? Do you think you can fix it? Oh and don't forget to jump to some hasty conclusions on the way.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use your controller dpads when in walk mode to walk around and use your hands and move them as if you're swimming when you're in the ocean. Make sure that you have enough space around you before you start playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dialogues were created using 15.ai and thus may sound a little weird.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game was based on my own habits where out of anxiety I would jump to conclusions rather than analysing the problem and countering it. I thought that this might be a fun little counter intuitive ending and a short experience. The gameplay shown was a bit rushed but if people want, they can stay and watch the whales and the fishes or even swim with them in the ocean. There are some fun little \"happenings\" throughout the ocean.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T14:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/239/239c5b9dae5003ae715da3bd830a2700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frosty :3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
