An edited version for your dumb kids!", "description": "<p>This is literally exactly the same core book as Lawman, with a Nickelodeon Orange cover and all the profanity and fun stuff taken out of it so your kid can look at it.<br/><br/>It's also a piece of total spite, intended to be a joke, is probably less playable than the original,\u00a0and also costs $5 more dollars because of hatred and to keep you from actually considering this a viable product.<br/><br/>It still features themes of violence in space, but you know what? It doesn't have f-bombs. So pick and choose your battles, parents.<br/><br/>I\u00a0expect nobody to purchase this, and if you do, <em><strong>you deserve the $5 price hike.</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:13:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/933c8514e277dc8ac752efbba25c9b82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Internet Famous Joe Martin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
