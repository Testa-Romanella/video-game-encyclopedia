Any feedback is welcome.</p><p>In the game you score up when you reach the yellow box. Touching red circles kills you. You can change your size by using w and s keys. The bigger you're, the slower you move and vice versa. At maximum size you stop. </p><p>Since the positions of the red circles are randomly generated, sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard. You try to reach your maximum score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef87f22fc59551862efdd8bc41c17dc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bahri Gordebak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
