The only company you have is a table and two cards ahead of you. The \"choice\" is yours...which Patron will you be fighting in the honor of?</p>\n<p>Soon after, your hand is dealt. The power is all in your hands (or is it?) to survive against an opposing god, who will try to stop you and aims to smite you for trespassing.</p>\n<p>How did you get into this mess?\u00a0Will you be able to get out?
