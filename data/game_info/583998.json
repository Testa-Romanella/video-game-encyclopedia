Further creation of better atmospheric lighting, ambient audio, and new environmental areas exist within this build.\u00a0The level design still reflects the linear narrative driven nature of the game, but now with more polished mechanics and deliberate narrative beats to give more context to the game. Get a much better feel for the more updated state of the game in this demo, which is far from perfect, but a project well on its way.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35bc2a3c4dc6da20a3f625b7b40fbb28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deja Vu Game"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
