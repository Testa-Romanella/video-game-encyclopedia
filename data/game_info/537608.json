Just turn the blocks to make them connect until you have a line without any breaks.</p>\n<p>3 game modes:<br/>- 42 to You: you have 42 seconds to play, and will get a feedback based on your style of play.<br/>- Frenzy Zone: just a few seconds, but you get a little more time for each line you make. Better lines give you more extra time.<br/>- 0-100: all the time you want, but only 100 moves to create the best sequence of lines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While you play you can enjoy some fantastic music: not a quick loop but a full song: Pointillistic by Bzur!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e3/8e3c284ec4c105e8761e1a413b254726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coneja Mutante"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
