You're a late-blooming farmer, \n      but the Harvest King doesn't have patience for girls who play all day! \n      That's why he weeded out the Harvest Goddess and the Harvest Sprites, \n      leaving you out standing in your fields. Break his spell by sowing seeds \n      and finding the Harvest Sprites. You'll need to master planting fields \n      and tending livestock. Perhaps a handsome bachelor will help you before \n      a mysterious thief steals your heart!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Marvelous"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Natsume"], "esrb_rating": null}
