I recommend to use the downloads.<br/></p><p>This point-and-click adventure sidescroller is made by me alone in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 36 Compo. It is completed and has an ending but no music (didn't have time left). The sounds are a bit laggy because of an engine bug back then (except for the linux version which I reexported since it got fixed).</p><p>The game uses the version 2.1 of Godot Engine (http://godotengine.org/). The whole project folder is located under https://github.com/lonesurvivor/LD-36, if you are interested. The Ludum Dare page of this game is http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=p...<br/></p> <p>The \"Compo\"-versions are the original ones I submitted.The \"Fixed\"-versions have a little bugfixed, where I forgot to include a graphic for an item. I recommend using this version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87695bbc53ab874b5d622d969e38bc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["patrickreh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
