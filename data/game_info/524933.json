After ten stars are collected, space debris falls from the sky and bounces around the platforms, threatening to stop the player from collecting more stars. Once she collects another ten stars, another piece of space debris falls, making it even more difficult for her to get points. If she is hit by space debris, the game ends and she is given her score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1c/b1cbcbe8ab3358a076350420b6f3473c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KatieBullock"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
