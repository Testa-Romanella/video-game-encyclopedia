No matter what happens eventually, you'll keep it in mind.<br/>Unique game style, beautiful melodies, a touch of sadness, silent monologue, and jointly create a different poetic, it makes you feel completely calm down, experience the life and love!<br/><br/>It is just like a poem followed:<br/><br/>Very quietly I take my leave<br/>As quietly as I came here;<br/>Quietly I wave good-bye<br/>To the rosy clouds in the western sky.<br/><br/><br/>The golden willows by the riverside<br/>Are young brides in the setting sun;<br/>Their reflections on the shimmering waves<br/>Always linger in the depth of my heart.<br/><br/><br/>The floatingheart growing in the sludge<br/>Sways leisurely under the water;<br/>In the gentle waves of Cambridge<br/>I would be a water plant!<br/><br/><br/>That pool under the shade of elm trees<br/>Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;<br/>Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds<br/>Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?<br/><br/><br/>To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream<br/>To where the green grass is more verdant;<br/>Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight<br/>And sing aloud in the splendour of starlight.<br/><br/><br/>But I cannot sing aloud<br/>Quietness is my farewell music;<br/>Even summer insects help silence for me<br/>Silent is Cambridge tonight!<br/><br/><br/>Very quietly I take my leave<br/>As quietly as I came here;<br/>Gently I flick my sleeves<br/>Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T05:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/adafca2621f6328fb6a8ac83562a4364_Ff5Epdy.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Guangping Wang"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Guangping Wang"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
