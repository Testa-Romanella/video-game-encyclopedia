Guard over cute blue Blups\u00a0on desert island and help them survive the longest!</p><p>Instructions -&gt;</p><p>Use A &amp; D to rotate across 7 different views across the map, following the whole island and more closely selected Blups!</p><p>Use F to switch between those views!</p><p>Use R to rush currently watched Blup so he can get closer to current objective. If he is hungry? It will be nearest bush with juicy fruits! If he is full? He will probably just roam around in search of interesting rock to look at. You dont want to rush the Blup then, as he may get further away from food source and may die on his way when he gets hungry again, stranded too far from his meal!</p><p>Also watch out for fierce predator roaming these lands - he also gets quite hungry at times and Blups are on the menu!</p><p>Death of all Blups is inevitable. If not hunger, the roaming\u00a0predator will eventually eat them all. But how much time have they left, before that happens? How much time to admire sand and interesting rocks? That depends on your ability to make them hurry up at\u00a0appropiate time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T18:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a36391da6c6ff48f8b8a6dd8c8922dd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Janku"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
