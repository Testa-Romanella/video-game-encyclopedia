Here comes the successor, this time a\u00a0fully fledged game! Welcome to Windows Deathmatch, a game that will turn your Desktop into an online 1v1 deathmatch game. I\u00a0highly recommend\u00a0watching the video before downloading to get a better grip of the game. HOWEVER this video is not a trailer. It is a video I made about the project that explains the game in a different and entertaining way.</p>\n\n\r\nBattles\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as the game finds you match, your desktop wallpaper will change to a randomly selected arena, a music will accompany this change and the battle will begin. (You can turn off wallpaper changes if you don't want the program to mess with your wallpapers.)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The battle begins and your opponents mouse will appear on your screen followed by two health bars. The goal is simple get your opponents health to 0. To do this you can use a slash attack using the \"Q\" &amp; \"E\" keys. Which key you use determines the direction of this attack.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Another way of inflicting damage is directly clicking on your opponent, which deals substantially more damage than a slash attack but it's extremely risky to perform as taking damage will reset your click charge. Landing a click or two\u00a0can easily change\u00a0the tide of a battle.</p>\n\r\nRanks and Levels\r\n\r\n<p>No game is complete without a reward system and WDM also has one. Performing well in matches will award you with XP\u00a0and RP. XP will help you get to the next level and unlock new skins for cursors. RP on the other hand will determine your rank and the people you will go up against.</p>\n\r\nCustomization\r\n\r\n<p>PC is all about customization and WDM wants to continue this trend. You can use all your cool music and wallpapers to create yourself a custom arena! Now you can listen to your favorite tunes and look at your favorite scenery while destroying your opponents. Upon gathering enough XP and reaching level thresholds you can customize your opponents mouse from a separate menu.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nA... Chat?\r\n\n<p>Communication is important, so every server in WDM has it's own global chat! Your name does not show up in this chat and players are differentiated by their colors and ranks.\u00a0 (I totally didn't add this because I was bored one afternoon)</p>\n\r\nExtra Credits:\r\n<p>Music: HaronTe,\u00a0LuKremBo</p>\n<p>That Amazing Wallpaper I Use (Not In The Game):\u00a0TsaoShin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95fd9b2d779d70da202f9295481e3b2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DHMelon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
