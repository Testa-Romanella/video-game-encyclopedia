The forest is based in the south west of England, saving the county flower of Devon and including patterns of this region, so it hits that diversifier.</p><p>This may not be immediately relatable to anti-authoritianism, but certain politicians seem to not think this is terribly important, when it really really is. And it's a huge problem that threatens everyone in the world.<br/></p><p>I have plans to expand this game and make more biomes, I have plans and mechanics for a couple more and I'd love suggestions of future levels.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f2763a27d81b632fccd3afa3d3bb14e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["A Little Red Panda"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
