The mouse can be used to access these buttons when they stop working for you.</p>\n<p>For example: Pausing the game can cause it not to resume without mouse intervention in some scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Currently there is an issue with the characters not keeping their initial colour.\u00a0 Due to this, the scoring which was proposed has not been implemented so that eventually you will be able to see who is the King or Queen of the Minigames \u2026 or the Joker.</p>\n<p><strong>Freeplay and Party Selection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These modes can break after one or two goes where the level select screen no longer works. Unfortunately, reloading the game is currently the only fix.   </p>\n<p>There is also a strange issue with the Party Selection mode where you will play the same minigame twice in a row even though it shouldn\u2019t be possible.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>For the best gameplay experience we recommend Party Shuffle and why not go for Shuffle 7.</p>\n<p>As you play, you may come across our coming soon levels, work is ongoing with these, but we will look to provide them as soon as possible.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Any feedback you may have for us will be welcomed, but for now go and have yourself some Minigame Mayhem.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T11:33:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a52fabafe280847e6c6a09020e14aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GilesGameDesign"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
