The theme was: You are the monster. My idea for that was that YOU control the monsters in the game, instead of the \"player\" running the level.\u00a0This is what I could get done in the 3hr limit.</p>\n<p>You can see the improved version (over the time limit) here.</p>\n<p>Built using microstudio.dev. (My first game exploring this ide.) Took about a half-hour to get the sprites all set up and another half-hour for\u00a0basic game functions using the Quick Engine. A\u00a0little over an hour to get the \"player\" AI working in a rudimentary but tolerable way. Balance of time to get some better player controls working, add\u00a0a title screen, and throw in some sound effects.</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<ul><li>Character sprites based on\u00a0Deep Night by Vexed (CC0) with some edits</li><li>Heart sprite derived from\u00a0Simple Dungeon Crawler by 0-lobster (CC0)</li><li>Map tiles from Inca Game Assets by Kronbits (PD)</li><li>Music:\u00a0\u201cCombat Plan\u201d short loop, from PlayOnLoop.com.\u00a0Licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0</li><li>Sound effects from\u00a0Groovy's Retro Sound Effects by GroovyMaster</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5bec443d67ab6d11a08a127f82effbde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blackhorse15A"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
