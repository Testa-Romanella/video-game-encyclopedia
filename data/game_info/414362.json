Having only worked in 2D up until now, I decided to dive into 3D and create a simple driving game. I found that a lot of 2D concepts transferred well but spent wayyy too much time learning about 3D physics, and I've only just scratched the surface. I actually made all the pixel art custom at PIxilart.com, a really great service.\u00a0I also started learning Blender for 3D modeling and made a couple simple objects for the game like the ramps and potholes, Blender is going to be a lot of fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have to give a shoutout to Brackeys and their amazing content for helping me through this project and others\u00a0over the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0I HIGHLY recommend their videos for both 2D and 3D.\u00a0I had so much fun building this game, I hope you enjoy it too!</p>\n<p>Stuff I learned:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Force Modes for rigidbodies, Skyboxes, 3D Player Controller, Blender basics, Flying/Gliding with animations, Animating mesh separate from collider, Maxing out speed, skyboxes, mesh colliders, displaying 2D text to player in 3D,\u00a0A ton more keyboard hotkeys, optimizing graphics settings...</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Car -\u00a0https://devilsworkshop.itch.io/3d-low-poly-car-game-asset-pack-vehicles-free</p>\n<p>Particle Pack -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-particl...</p>\n<p>Beep Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/14FValtrovaT/sounds/419698/</p>\n<p>Wispy Skybox -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/wispy-skybox-21737</p>\n<p>Environment - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153</p>\n<p>Powerup -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/magic-particle-systems-lite-95868</p>\n<p>Explosion Sound -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/grenade-sound-fx-147490</p>\n<p>Sound FX -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-54116</p>\n<p>Music - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/absolutely-free-music-4883</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10b48734da669065963576f5f220904.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rompkins"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
