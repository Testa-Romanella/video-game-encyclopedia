The game takes place in the ruins of a world that once was yours. In order to redeem yourself, you will have to go through deserts, canyons, and temples... to the highest mountain.<br/><br/><strong>\u00abPunished by the gods, the greedy one was locked up in the blade, his ascent will be his redemption\u00bb</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The main interest of being a sword is exploring new ways of moving around and overcoming obstacles. Jump, dash, spin or spike to the ground and walls, in other words create your own path.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game takes place in the ruins of a world that once was yours, immersing the player in an uncanny universe: giants and folks trapped in the sand, humongous gates, staring eyewalls...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is meant to be challenging, but not unfair or frustrating. The difficulty is a direct reflection of the game lore: the character need of redemption, and the struggle that it implies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T03:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/3313801dc62a7a5d3bc6ff07cbaf13fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 321, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Opia Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Opia Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
