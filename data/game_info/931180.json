This game demonstrates my current knowledge as a programmer in Unity3D using C#. Aside from the player sprite, UI panels, and font, I made all assets using GIMP (I'm not an artist).\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, you have health, stamina, magic, and skills. There are items on the ground you can pick up and survival resources such as trees and boulders you can collect from. You can craft items to assist you and build a campfire and chest using the Building Tabliet. Watch out for the \"thorns\" to the west.</p><p>To keep up with the progress check out my Trello</p><p>Trello:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/Dwo6vp62/production-board</p><p>If you'd like to see some of my videos check out my YouTube (it's just my \"games\")</p><p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOZO3w6SkYyUlKVXJOaswMA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T07:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/807f86f311574b6acc54e8fc07d45ca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["forgetful_user"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
