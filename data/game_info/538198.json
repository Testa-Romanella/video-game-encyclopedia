The winning Team takes home the Scramble Cup for the year!<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by games like <em>Pyre</em>, <em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</em> and <em>Into the Breach</em>, <strong>Snowdrift Scramble</strong> combines the chaos of Ice Hockey with the team tactics of Rugby wrapped up in a whimsical fantasy setting with adorable Monsters :)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>This game is played using the Keyboard and Mouse.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>W / A / S / D</strong> - Pan Camera</li><li><strong>Q / E</strong> - Rotate Camera\r\n</li><li><strong>Spacebar</strong> - Center Camera on Current Unit</li><li><strong>Middle Mouse Wheel </strong>- Zoom In / Out Camera</li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> - Select Action / Tile</li><li><strong>Right Mouse Button </strong>- Cancel Selected Action</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Each Player has a team of Monsters who they must use to capture the Sacred Egg and bring it back to their Goal Area. Players alternate taking turns to have Monsters on their team perform up to two Actions on their turn. All Monsters can perform each of the following Actions once:</p>\n<br/><strong>Move</strong><br/>Move a Monster in a direction. If they are Moving on Ice tiles, they will keep moving until they hit another Monster, a Wall or a Ground tile. If they hit another Monster, additional Movement may occur based on their Weights.<br/><br/><strong>Throw Snow</strong><br/>Throws a magical Snow Ball at another Monster (ally or enemy) lowering their temperature by one step.\u00a0 Projectiles need to have unblocked line-of-sight for this Action to be successful.<br/><br/><strong>Throw Fire</strong>Throws a magical Fire Ball at another Monster (ally or enemy) raising their temperature by one step. Projectiles need to have unblocked line-of-sight for this Action to be successful.<br/><br/><strong>Throw Egg</strong><br/>Only appears when a Monster is in possession of an Egg. They can throw the Egg to another Monster (ally or enemy) and give them possession of the Egg instead. <br/><br/><strong>End Turn</strong><br/>Monsters end their Turn passing to the next Monster in the Turn Order.<br/>\n<p>Instead of Health, Monsters have to manage Temperature. If their Temperature falls too low, they become <strong>Frozen </strong>and can't act for their next 2 Turns. If their Temperature rises too high, they start <strong>Burning </strong>up and will panic moving randomly causing nearby Monsters to also catch Fire for their next 2 Turns.<br/></p>\n<p>Monsters in possession of the Sacred Egg can score by either running into their Goal Area or throwing the Egg to a Monster in their Goal area to score a point! If however, they become Frozen or Burning while holding the Sacred Egg, they will drop the Egg allowing other Monsters to snatch it up instead.</p>\n<p>The first team to score 2 Points wins the game!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Carson Anich</strong> (@AnimatedGeek100) - Illustrator / Animator</li><li><strong>David Jones</strong> (@DJs_SecretPlans) - 3D Modeling</li><li><strong>Isiah Brighton</strong> (@IsiahGames) - Lead Programmer</li><li><strong>Swarnava Banerjee</strong> (@mythbuilder) - Designer / UI Programmer</li></ul>\n<p>Music tracks from Kevin MacLeod (Incompetech).
