You will travel with Rachel Daniels on her journey to forgiveness through the rediscovery of old memories. So often we forget to look at things from someone else's perspective, and we forget that everyone that comes and goes in our lives leaves behind a part of them within us. Good or bad, we learn from them. This Time Around aims to be that reminder.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can find us on \r\n\tTwitter or Facebook.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Thank you and enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabc6e9e0cbf41a79e05bd7fa3677ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Night Light Visuals"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
