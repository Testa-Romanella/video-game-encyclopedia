You can double your score by jumping through multiplication clouds or get indestructible for some time by hitting the\u00a0protective bubbles. But beware of all bombs, flashes, walls and thundery clouds as they are your enemies and will try to break up the flow of your run.<br/><br/><br/>HIGHLIGHTS<br/>- new and unique jump&amp;run control method<br/>- simple \"one touch\" navigation<br/>- easy start-levels<br/>- more &amp; more challenging as levels progress<br/><br/><br/>FREE VERSION - FEATURES <br/>- 10 game levels<br/>- retina-display optimized graphics<br/>- in-game help<br/><br/><br/>FULL VERSION - FEATURES<br/>- 50 game levels<br/>- 5 color worlds<br/>- retina-display optimized graphics<br/>- in-game help<br/>- game center achievements &amp; leaderboards<br/><br/><br/>VISIT US \u2013\u00a0randerline.com<br/>FOLLOW US \u2013\u00a0twitter.com/randerline<br/>LIKE US \u2013\u00a0facebook.com/randerline<br/>WATCH US \u2013\u00a0youtube.com/randerline<br/><br/><br/>COMPATIBLE DEVICES<br/>RunDaLine is compatible with 3rd (32GB &amp; 64GB) and 4th generation iPod touch, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad and iPad 2.<br/><br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTICE<br/>If you experience any problems with the game or in case you have any questions or comments, please contact us directly - support(at)randerline.com.
