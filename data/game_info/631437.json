Took a bunch of the suggestions and the one I went with was \"A horror game where you're the laugh audience for Friends and it gets worse with every missed queue.\" Thats pretty much what this is. Only it's not really a horror game. Or even really, like, a game. More of an... interactive sketch comedy experience? Maybe?</p>\n<p>I used p5.js, in case that's the kind of thing people were wondering.</p>\n<p>SPOILERS(kind of)</p>\n<p>Tip for pro gamers: The best way to experience this is probably to just never touch the keyboard.\u00a0Thats how you get all the good dialogue. This game kinda punishes you for succeeding in it, you just end up watching a bad sitcom. Is that an intentional subversion, or a design flaw? Only you can decide.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:01:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d8c2265340615e9c914bfa7b9cf6e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BadGames4BadPeople"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
