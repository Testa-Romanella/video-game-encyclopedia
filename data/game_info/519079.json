Although the game is a little buggy and doesn't have sound, I'm proud of it. I present to you: BLUNS, a game about blocks with guns(hence the title). In this top down shooter mixed with a bit of puzzle,\u00a0you are a block who must kill other blocks and circle. Controls are WASD to move, escape to pause, and... nothing else. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f298cabf237e04d2f19a33765e7f3d5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DinoBoy56"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
