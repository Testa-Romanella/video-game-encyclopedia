This game originally started as a small side project. Initially it was never going to be a game in itself. But rather a small pixel art environment. But I decided to take the opportunity to start learning UE4 Blueprints a bit more, and bit by bit I've expanded it to become what it is today.</p><p>So this is it: </p><p>A Skip And A Hop Too Far Into Light Speed</p><p>The game is a bit made up, I never really had a design plan. Its a bit of a mash up of ideas. Best way to describe the game is a first person puzzle speed running game.</p><p>So you are Gordon, a ship maintenance guy. Unfortunately you work on some of the worst spaceships, with jump drives that seem to always be faulty. Stop the space ship from colliding with whatever happens to be in front, and complete the task.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a59ce2cca8ecc40c4ee9f5d665439b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Defaultsound"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
