{"id": 340513, "slug": "hellzebu", "name": "HellZebu", "name_original": "HellZebu", "description": "<p><strong>HellZebu </strong>is a <strong>first person shooter</strong> where the player has to fight against <strong>monsters </strong>in different <strong>arenas </strong>as well as to solve platforming <strong>puzzles </strong>between each arena. The main feature in the game is that the player can travel between two opposite <strong>worlds </strong>(ice and fire), and change enemies from one world to another as well. This can be useful for avoiding big hordes or for killing a specific type of monster, which is invulnerable in its original world.</p>\n<p>The goal is to survive the arena by cleaning it from monsters and, by doing so, to get access to the next arena, and so on\u00a0until surviving the last one. Each arena has a higher difficulty than the previous one.</p>\n\n<p>It was developed by a team of <strong>5 university students</strong> in a period of <strong>10 weeks</strong>.</p>\n\r\nDevelopment team\r\nArt\r\n<p>V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez\u00a0@Vilogi24</p>\r\nProgramming\r\n<p>Andrea P\u00e9rez\u00a0@andrea_prezp</p>\n<p>Pere Estrems\u00a0@Pereto2</p>\r\nDesign\r\n<p>Marc Triguero\u00a0@marc_trigueror</p>\n<p>Gorka Merindano\u00a0@Suck_My_Elbows</p>\n\r\nSoundtrack credits\r\n<p><strong>Really Slow Motion\u00a0 - Deadwood</strong></p>\n<p>Visit them at http://www.reallyslowmotion.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Enmarta - Putrefaction Chamber</strong></p>\n<p>Visit them at http://cryochamber.bandcamp.com</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Lizotte - Sonic Destruction</strong></p>\n<p>Visit them at\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/thrasher726</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Lizotte - Game Over</strong></p>\n<p>Visit them at\u00a0https://www.darkcabin-studios.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Whitesand - The Last Stand</strong></p>\n<p>Visit them at https://whitesand.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Sixto sounds, Steppo &amp; Zircon - The Passing of the Blue Crown</strong>\n</p>\n\r\nDownload instructions\r\n<p>Download the zip and extract the main folder ('HellZebu').</p>\n<p>Inside this folder, there are different files needed for the game to run correctly. <strong>DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THEM</strong>.</p>\n<p>To play the game, execute the file named <strong>HellZebu (exe)</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the window that appears, make sure the screen configuration fits with your PC/laptop (resolution, quality...).</p>\n<p>And you got it!\u00a0Press \"Play!\" and enjoy!! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/154380ce282162c074fed47f06a52b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team HellZebu"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
