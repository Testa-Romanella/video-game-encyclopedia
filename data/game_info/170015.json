We have lived in prosperity and established absolute power in the galaxy.</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>Until the day an anomaly came in the further reaches of our system.</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>A portal opened and unleashed beings we thought exist only in fiction. They wiped out every planet, defense stations and armadas we have. Only one ship survived and make its last stand against these dreadful beings.\"</em>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Rage of the Galactic Beings</strong> is a tribute to old school arcade games, inspired by arcade legends such as <em>Galaga</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em> etc. You control a lone surviving ship fighting against a fleet of evil galactic beings in a quest to destroy everything in its path. The enemies are categorized in 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue), and can only be damaged by shooting them with the corresponding color. Hit them with a wrong color and you lose points.</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows</p><p>\n<strong>Features:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Alien invasion!</li>\n<li>Classic arcade feel</li>\n<li>10 short but challenging stages</li>\n<li>Mind bending mechanic (not suitable for those with color blindness)</li>\n<li>Awesome chiptune music</li></ul><p>\n<strong>Controls: </strong>\n<br/>\r\n\tMovement - left/right arrow keys or A/D\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tShoot Red - B or C\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tShoot Green - N or X\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tShoot Blue - M or Z\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Personal Note:</strong><br/>\r\n\tI started making this game because I was heavily inspired by locomalito's work on old school arcade games. I treated this game as my comeback to game development since my hiatus for 2 years. This game is not without its flaws, but I'm proud of how it turned out.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIronic as it sounds, I enjoyed every minute of stressful coding, designing and effort I've put into this in a short amount of time. I hope you enjoy playing it too!\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>deluksic - retro crt distortion effect source</li>\n<li>Ivan Bilon - motivation, enemy pattern algorithm and beautiful chiptune music of the game</li><li>Louise Romero - playtesting</li>\n<li>Arron Javal - game title design</li>\n<li>locomalito - inspiration</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c82acec8fdc43192491a8bc843a005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["killallbotz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
