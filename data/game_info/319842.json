In this program you can generate an effectively infinite number of 2D space shooter boss battles and see them play out. Not much gameplay to speak of as this is more of a toy than a game and a lot of the required gamey features weren't implemented in time for version 1.<br/></p>\n<p>There are some parts I intended to implement over the course of this development period that weren't completed and may come in the future for closure's sake.</p>\n<ul><li>Boss type affecting more, including sprite generation.</li><li>More weapon types.</li><li>More attack types.</li><li>Randomised attack types and projectiles.</li><li>More movement pattern types and variables, including rotation.</li><li>Generated boss names, health bars, and stats.</li><li>Basic gameplay like being able to damage the boss, take damage yourself.</li></ul>\n<p>Find a cool boss battle or have any ideas for how I could improve this? Share the seed or your feedback in the comments below!</p>\n<p>Right shift to Generate Boss</p>\n<p>Escape to exit Play Mode</p>\n<p>Toggle UI with TAB!</p>\n<p>Toggle Auto-Generator with /</p>\n<p>NOTE: I didn't have time\u00a0to implement an exit to desktop command in this version\u00a0so you'd do best to use Alt+F4 when you're done.
