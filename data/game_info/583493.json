Relentlessly rising crime rates have led to the widespread return of capital punishment. In an effort to keep the increasingly angry citizens entertained and distracted, a new game show was created; Bail or Bust.</p>\n<p>Criminals who have been sentenced to death can choose to fight it out for the enjoyment of millions, taking on wave after wave of killer droids, not to mention enforcers; trained killing machines. And if they win, they get their freedom.</p>\n<p>No one has ever won.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Bail or Bust is a grid-based dungeon crawler style game. Your goal is clear each arena and, ultimately, win your freedom by beating the enforcer. To clear an arena you will need to find the key card to open the exit.</p>\n<p>Move around using WASD or the arrow keys, Q/E to rotate, and SPACE/ENTER to attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your enemies work on a timer (shown in the bottom corner) and can only perform an action once per \"turn\". You do not have to wait for a \"turn\" to perform an action, but any time you do, the turn counter is reset and your enemies can move again.</p>\n<p>Each action you perform costs you stamina, and you will not be able to move or attack if you are out of it. You will regain stamina every \"turn\" in which you do not perform an action.</p>\n<p>Also be on the lookout for health and armour packs which give you... uh... health and armour.</p>\r\nDungeon Crawler Jam 2021\r\n<p>This game is an entry for DCJam2021, a 7 day jam with strict rules about the game mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49fe681481e56971b31b8c18aa41ef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["b3agz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
