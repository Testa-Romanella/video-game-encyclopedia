Light was the only thing known and thought. The Kingdom was a grand spectacle, and existed so long that most never thought to wonder if there was a beginning to it all. Slowly, the Shadow crept in, only being noticed at first in forlorn corners and alleys of the Kingdom. A sickness unknown was slowly spreading, slowly making itself known to the Kingdom, something never before experienced or discovered.</p>\n<p>When the Shadow struck, it was strong and it was cruel. The Kingdom was besieged and ruined in a single fortnight. All the splendor and rapture was quickly sank to nothingness. The people had no choice but to retreat. Of course they tried to build again. The Shadow, however, was too strong and too clever. Wherever the people attempted to build and set root, the Shadow was quick behind to nullify. The people were distraught. They had to keep moving no matter what, and that is what they did. Forced to become nomads, they vowed one day to find the Hero.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>lapspider45: code, design<br/></p>\n<p>raptor0999: code, writing</p>\n<p>kruffin: code</p>\n<p>polyphorge: art</p>\n<p>Isabella Lau: music, SFX<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5eb/5ebf557da4ce738b4474235f250afa15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lapspider45", "issycatlau125", "polyphorge", "raptor9999", "kruffin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
