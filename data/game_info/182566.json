It contains only one small level where you learn how to control the character and use the age clock power.</p>\n<p>With this power you can go back in time (it only affects you) and take your baby form, or forward in time to take your elderly form. There are 3 forms: adult, baby, elder.</p>\n<p>Each form has specific traits that make them necessary to go through the level.</p>\n<p>The animations of the character (and the power animation on top of it) are hand made by me using GraphicsGale software. It was fun animating these simple characters :).</p>\n<p>The other assets are mostly from Kenney.</p><p>Update: the game now doesn't run the debug window when the game is launched, enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5de/5de7308538eb6ac6b4473d27ef9cf450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alariann"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
