As far as Kennedy knows, there is no escape to this world so she must fight to survive. She comes across walking goblins she dubs Gobby's, jumping frog-like creatures she dubs Jummy's, and flying creatures she dubs Friggy's. She fights these enemies for as long as she can in order to survive.</p>\n<p>Acid Knockout is a king of the hill style game with a cute-horror art style designed to encompasses the basic functionality of traditional games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018), and Brawlhallo (2014). The art style is retro cute-horror\u00a0inspired by Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 (2015) and ACA Neo-Geo Metal Slug V (2013). The game is designed around a core gameplay loop that involves a static level with fast-paced waves of spawning enemies and pickups.</p>\n<p>This game was created by 6 students at the University of Utah for Entertainment Arts and Engineering 3710: Traditional Game Development during the Spring 2021 semester.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f7dd81a175d983499d2d3a856a5ee8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gabi_ander"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
