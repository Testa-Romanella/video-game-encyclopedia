A bit of extortion, a couple girls. All on a pretty good scale. In those days, I had it all! But then I got too careless and the ATF raided my crib. Luckily, they didn\u2019t have too much evidence against me. Still, that mess brought me three years in Rikers Island. During a yard exercise, a guy tried to knife the President of the Bastards of Hell MC. Usually, of course, the first rules in the slammer are: Don\u2019t see, don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t tell. And most importantly, don\u2019t get involved. But the MC guys were honest types. I guess that was why I didn\u2019t just turn my head. Now the Club owed me. I guess I could a joined the MC, but I preferred doing my own thing. Still, the whole appearance of these guys really impressed me. <br/>Three years later I am finally a free man again and the clink did not tame me one bit. However, it is time to start something new.
