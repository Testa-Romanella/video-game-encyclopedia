THE CITY IS ABSOLUTELY FINE. PLEASE FORGET THAT IT EVER EXISTED.\u201d</strong><br/><br/>Weird and unfortunate things are happening in the city of Daybreak. To the rest of the world, the city seems to have simply vanished, but inside, it has become a playground for mysterious beings who see humans only as hosts for their own amusement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Alicia\u2019s a bit strange. She still likes to wear her old baseball jersey, even though her team disbanded over a year ago. She can see otherworldly creatures that no one else seems to notice. She also has weird powers that she keeps hidden from the rest of the world. But when she receives a call for help from her niece in Daybreak, she\u2019ll do anything to save her.<br/><br/>Caught up in the struggle along with Alicia are Miriam, a secretary and gun aficionado who only wants to escape the city, Lamar, an overworked middle school English teacher, and Dottie, Alicia\u2019s niece, who has been captured for some nefarious purpose.<br/><br/>Explore what\u2019s left of the ravaged city and find your way through surreal otherworldly areas that connect the broken urban shell.
