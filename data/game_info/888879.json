Collect crystals and go for the fastest time. And please leave feedback, good or bad<br/><br/>\u00a0<strong>Issues I am working on<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Collision (right now Tichi is very buggy on sloped objects. This is most apparent on the giant vine)</p>\n<p>- Camera clipping (The camera currently goes through any object. I'm trying to figure out how to get it to move closer to Tichi when in contact with a physical object)</p>\n<p>- Animations (Tichi is currently pretty stiff feeling. More animations will be added (such as a landing animation) and old ones will be made smoother)</p>\n<p>- Wood splinter sprite is broken (This only happens in the built version of the game. In the unity editor the sprite works fine so, i'm not so sure what the problem is)</p>\n<p>- Death effect breaks when dying multiple times in quick succession</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T14:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/802473af614b35bfbe5faea1b8d845a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaptivWare"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
