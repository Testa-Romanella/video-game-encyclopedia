This game takes direct inspiration from episode 9 of Garupa Pico OHMORI, which depicts what seems to be an animated mock-up for a\u00a0 BanG\u00a0\u00a0Dream! puzzle game in which the player must match up characters from the series with their corresponding band members.\u00a0I decided to make a playable game based on this concept and add in some extra features that were not present in the source material.</p>\r\nCONTROLS (Keyboard):\r\n<p><strong>Left and Right Arrow Keys:\u00a0</strong>Move left and right<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Down Arrow Key:\u00a0</strong> Fall faster<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Up Arrow Key:\u00a0</strong>Quick Drop<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Z and X\u00a0Keys:\u00a0</strong>Rotate left and right<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>On-screen controls can be enabled for mobile users.</em></strong><br/></p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>Match up characters from the same band.\u00a0If all five band members connect, they will disappear and points will be scored. Obstacles will also fall for certain characters, which can be cleared by matching characters near those obstacles. The game speed will increase every time you get a match.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Unlike the original episode,\u00a0<strong>Raise A Suilen\u00a0</strong> and\u00a0<strong>Morfonica\u00a0</strong>members will also appear in the game.</li><li>When using the rotate buttons as\u00a0<strong>Kokoro</strong>, you will move upwards, allowing you to go against gravity\u00a0(this is seen in the original episode).</li><li><strong><em>Easter Egg:\u00a0</em></strong><strong>Michelle </strong>has a 10% chance of spawning as <strong>Misaki </strong>(no bear costume) instead.</li></ul>\r\nComing Soon:\r\n<ul><li>Puyo-Puyo inspired\u00a0<strong>Versus\u00a0</strong><strong>Mode</strong></li><li>Downloadable versions for PC and Android</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb6/cb6797b61f459a0a824a42499cf76b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thebuddyadrian"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
