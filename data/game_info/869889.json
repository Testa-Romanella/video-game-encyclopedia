Fight your way through slimes and bats, collect gold, and\u00a0find a key to get\u00a0the next level of the dungeon. But be careful, if your HP reaches 0, you get brought back to the start of the dungeon. After each level you can select a potion to drink, which will boost your stats, but choose wisely.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Movement - Arrow Keys<br/>Attack - Swing your mouse around and hope for the best<br/>Select - Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Dungeon Layouts Generated with:\u00a0https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:<br/>You may get the same dungeon layout twice in a row. This is because making the layouts takes a long time and is quite boring, plus procedural generation wasn't working with my tileset. If this happens to you, then I apologize. I like the direction this game is going though, so i might come back and add more layouts at a later stage.</p><p>(<em>Background music via\u00a0https://www.FesliyanStudios.com)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T06:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b1d9c3493fd6cf198ab6d43b73d1b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Okau"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
