The game is nowhere near perfect, and I would love any feedback, whether that be positive or negative. The main issue is that the weapon is very buggy and the enemies don't hurt you yet, but these are issues I want to fix in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the song used is a remake of Casino Forest (Sonic Forces) by Dv2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-r7iejYsWg&amp;t=26s). If I continue this game in the future, I will most likely change it to something else.\u00a0\u00a0Either way, enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a59d91eab6a5e42666a6d1c76c1e25c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Golbats4Equality"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
