You play as Desiderius, captain of the Ahisma. Captain Desiderius built this ship to be a research vessel, and is on the run from the military after escaping in the Ahisma, after their request to take it to re purpose into a vessel of war. From there his fate is in your hands. Explore two solar systems, interact with random encounters and multiple planets. Land and sell your loot in ports on planets, and complete work on the Ahisma in ports and docks around the galaxy. But beware of military forces hunting you. From time to time they will appear and chase you. The only way to escape them is to hide on planets, and should they destroy the Ahisma.. your story is over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Erasmus was made at a two day game jam at Utah Valley University for the\u00a0Utah Indie Game Jam 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/78062db7314e40030f7a764fc98ea507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan L"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
