Game made in unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>Free assets were used in the making of this which mostly comes from the Unreal Engine Learn Section. I hope to develop this game further into the future but for now I hope you like what I have produced!\u00a0</p><p>Tips:</p><ul><li>Move backward before being attacked to avoid taking as much damage</li><li>Move around and don't let the enemies build up or you will be overwhelmed</li><li>You can run away from enemies. And they will eventually stop chasing you.</li><li>You don't have to kill all enemies.</li></ul><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Known Bugs:</p><p>- Mouse cursor doesn't appear in UI (Appeared before Compilation)</p><p>- Tree Textures Missing (Appeared before Compilation)\u00a0</p><p>- Restart button doesn't work. I tried to grey it out compared to the quit game button but should have greyed it out more. You'll just have to exit and restart.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Typical FPS Controls:</p>\n<p>[W][S][A][D] - Move</p>\n<p>[Left Click] - Attack</p>\n<p>[Mouse] - Look</p>\n<p>[Shift] - Sprint</p>\n<p>[Spacebar]- Jump<br/></p>\n<p>[Ctrl] - Crouch</p>\n<p>[Esc] - Pause</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Reccomended specs:\u00a0</p>\n<p>CPU: Intel i3 or better</p>\n<p>GPU: GTX 780 or Better</p>\n<p>RAM: 8GB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce9/ce9e65d3565a1cbedb767d802bf2fbab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AeliosZero"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
