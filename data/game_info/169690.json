The gameplay follows largely other match-3 games, but with a twist. You will match different station signs and with them turn the tide of battle, prioritize which opponent you want to destroy first, or release a giant charged laser to wipe all of their little fighter apart. Have a giant charged attack coming your way? Raise your shields up and prepare for impact. Have a small lull in the fight, send your men to repair the ship. Whatever it takes to wipe the xenon threat from your borders. You are the only hope for millions of innocent colonists, good luck captain.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Match-3 Puzzles</li>\n<li>Combat</li>\n<li>Several Difficult Levels</li>\n<li>Bosses</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tMatching Stars is free software, released under the GNU General Public License version 3.
