There's a lot of bugs to be fixed and I will appreciate any feedback.</p>\n<p>2. The logic system is a bit confusing, so please READ THE TUTORIAL in the game menu.</p>\n<p>3. I am fully aware that this is a scrap mechanic rip-off. I am working on this game just because I want to see how far I can get just by myself and I am only publishing it to see if people on the internet like my work.</p>\n<p>4. I know that many people don't like pink. I will add the option to change the color in a future update.</p>\n<p>5.
