I plan to add more features and stages, as well as more things for the bunny girl to do, such as clothing, furniture, interactive world, etc.</p>\n<p>It is still in a very rough stage, so I apologize if it is in a lack of quality, but I hope that you can still enjoy this game for what it is right now. If you enjoyed it and would like to see more, do consider supporting me!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please enjoy Bunny Girl Jump!\u00a0<br/>Let me know what you think of it in the comments below!<br/>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>For the best experience, play in fullscreen mode.<br/>If the Unity loader is stuck, try refreshing the page and it should work!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Basically, I did everything except for the background and foreground elements (moon, sky, clouds). They were assets made by\u00a0edermunizz. He does some really cool pixel art backgrounds and stuff, be sure to check him out if you think it's cool.</p>\n<p>For the music, I composed it using a DAW. It is an actual song that I made, and this is the edited version of it. This piece is called \"Prance in the Twilight Garden\".</p>\n<p>The character sprites and animations are all done in Aseprite. It is a great tool for pixel art if anyone is interested in it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/4675032a717fd9351ac16883966be03c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chingy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
