It's a chemistry based puzzle game where you move atoms around on a tile-based grid to create the required output with the help of special tiles which can bond, rotate, and teleport atoms. Atoms can be bound together into molecules and molecules broken down into atoms. For now there are 20 levels, with more coming eventually.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b3f7a036066e042b6fb499c8291b734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick J.
