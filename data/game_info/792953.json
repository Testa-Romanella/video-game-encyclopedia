I am uploading this piece as my graduate school thesis from ITP at NYU! This piece's name is XO.</p>\n<p>I am uploading both a VR version and a keyboard+mouse version. VR version definitely has more immersiveness, but PC version is more convenient for sure!</p>\n<p>Here's some documentation of the project:</p>\n<p>XO is a virtual reality walking simulator in an unreal world of symbols to explore gender dynamics in a heterosexual relationship in Chinese modern society. Compared with ubiquitous literal discussions on case-specific questions, XO uses an immersive medium and focuses on the logic behind the phenomenon.<br/> It poses a question:<br/> <br/></p>\r\nWhy, for the heterosexual relationship in Chinese Society, do most men share a perception that Investing monetary value in goods and services to satisfy women\u2019s needs is a preferred way that men and women could make progress toward an exclusive romantic relationship?\r\n<p> It picks one of the answers to explore:<br/> <br/></p>\r\nthe propaganda from consumerism\r\n<p>  XO builds an unreal world where the audience could immerse themselves so that they can not just think but also feel the narrative. At the same time, XO uses geometric shapes as symbols to deduce the individual cases into trends. The implicit power of symbols gives the audience the framework to fill their understanding. Together, this world of symbols becomes the playground for all discussions on gender dynamics. It becomes an invented medium for future exploration.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T16:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6c00d482af5e31baf635144cb7bcb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["farronmoremore"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
