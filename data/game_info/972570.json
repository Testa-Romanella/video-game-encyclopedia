I adore every single character, the art, the setting, the writing, the humor, the NSFW. Literal perfection. Please keep up the good work because oh my god I am gonna be so heartbroken if this ever ends on a cliffhanger. I am actually so dedicated to this project and kudos a billion times to you!!!\" -@Charsunegg<br/><br/>\"Andi is making <strong>really smart and reactive</strong> otome games with a system which I'm excited to see applied to way more stuff! Characters remember when you told them you love them and react to your actions organically in a way that I've always wished games like Fire Emblem, Rune Factory, and so much more would do. I think it's really cool to see a mechanic like this applied in the indie space!\" -@kotalinejones<br/><br/>\"im absolutely in love with the characters, they're very well-written, with lots of attention and details, each of them is unique. even the side characters have their own vibe which is awesome. the story moves in perfect tempo [...] <strong>the game is something very beautiful and important</strong> and ur attitude to it and others who like it is the same\" -@huaishanhai", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-24T06:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7dbff3d0d585e5895997c5c91aa307.jpg", "website": "https://slasheru.neocities.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andi Santagata"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tenth Circle"], "esrb_rating": null}
