It is a top down 2.5D puzzle game about extraterrestrial fauna invading the Earth... just to look for a water source.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to guide the root of the extraterrestrial plant to reach the elusive water and hydrate them to grow. The plants are rather picky, however, as they'll refuse to drink when they're still hydrated. You're also given a timer to challenge you to finish the levels as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>This project has been developed in less than 48 hours, excluding rests. Some cuts have to be made to make time for the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Controls</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Up / W : Move root up</p>\n<p>Down / S : Move root down</p>\n<p>Left / A : Move root left</p>\n<p>Right / D : Move root right</p>\n<p>R : Reset level</p>\n<p>P : Pause</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Contributors</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Hydrogen</strong> are:</p>\n<ul><li>MakotoIchinose - Code, idea, VFX, audio</li><li>Rxdsavt - Artwork</li><li>Hanif012- Level design, audio sourcing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbed518d02d31a0509da626451e706a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MakotoIchinose", "Rxdsavt", "hanif012"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
