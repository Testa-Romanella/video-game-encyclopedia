The last bastion of hope for Earth, E-CON operates out of vast militarised caverns and tries it's utmost to find a way to wrestle control of Earth back from the Insectron invaders.<br/><br/>** Aliens: Insectron **<br/>The basis for all Insectron 'life' are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines.  The first substance, labelled 'Xenoaqua', is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour.  It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua.  The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup.  Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage.  It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims.  The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.<br/><br/>** Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) **<br/>Humans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force. They now have their eyes set upon Earth, to reap revenge.<br/><br/>Find us on Facebook \u2013 facebook.com/HexWar<br/>Follow us on Twitter - @HexWarGames <br/>Game Forum - hexwar.com/forums <br/><br/>Thank you for supporting our games! <br/><br/><br/>All Rights Reserved.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa9e9d0fd734d1bdec8fcd828c61ac80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["HexWar Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["HexWar Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
