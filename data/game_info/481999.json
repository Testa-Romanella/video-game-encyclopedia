Joined by Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell, you will be able to visualize and interact with the magnetic forces in action like never before.</p><p>--</p>\n<p>Put on the \"Dyson Hat\" to see the invisible forces - the math structure superimposed onto the reality. We were inspired by Prof. Freeman Dyson's essays to design this hat for visualizing the two-layer structure of the world - the reality that satisfied math equations and the reality that we can touch.</p>\n<p>Pick up two bar magnets and feel the magnetic field.\u00a0Use a bar magnet to generate current from the helix coils. Do you know why the direction of current changes?</p><p>--</p>\n<p>Faraday's Magnets VR app is created with Unreal Engine 4.24.
