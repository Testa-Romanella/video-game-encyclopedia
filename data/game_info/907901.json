Some of  the richest people in your country will attend a party organized in your  town. You weren\u2019t necessarily invited, but will be going anyways. As a  master of pickpocketing you\u2019ll surely find a lot of reckless people with  too much valuables in their possession - will you be kind enough to  help them dispose of their baggage? Let the harvest night begin.\r\n</p>\n<p>Carefully steal items from people  while engaging in small-talk in order to keep their guard down. Don\u2019t  try anything suspicious! The hotels staff will be happy to have one  guest less to serve. Keep up the conversation, no matter how ludicrous  it may seem - sometimes too much wealth turns people into nuts!\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse is recommended.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:08:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/361d191bc131152c05517087cfa50088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Big Cyckos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
