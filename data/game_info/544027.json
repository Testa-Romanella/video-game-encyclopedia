Males deal more damage but are a bit slower, females deal less damage but are quicker and jump a bit higher. There are also power-ups in the boxes placed in the game arena.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave fun with destroying the game environment and beating your high scores!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T15:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84d23900a34e4bf2c310f3e7687eede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aasura Project"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Aasura Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
