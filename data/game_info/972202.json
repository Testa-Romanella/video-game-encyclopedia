For this team, it's been an incredibly hard one. Searching for a long lost legendary remnant of the first space faring civilisation, it's taken years and in some cases, great personal loss but it's finally been found-EMPIRE! A planet ship of incredible size and technology, said by some to even have the power to grant wishes!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut when it turns out not only to be hostile but active too, and shoots down one of the team only for them to call a desperate last wish for revenge that it actually decides to grant, things go from bad to disastrous! With an ancient superweapon out to grant revenge, your friend injured and a galaxy unaware of the danger approaching it, that's where you come in!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTaking control of an elite fighter, the Type One, you'll have to take to the air and space across 5 levels, to stop the ancient threat before it's too late! Master the ship's lasers, beam weapons and it's screen clearing electron pulse to make it through! And take care-the enemy has more than a few tricks up their sleeves!<br/>\r\nAnd, if you're feeling up to the challenge, aim for that 1cc perfect run!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T06:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d5505c03e22516e4893fbf4a6e66e61b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BWI Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["BWI Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
