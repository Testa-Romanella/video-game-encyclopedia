Eight tons of firepower crammed into a 30 ft. hull. For decades, the U.S. Navy has deployed the river patrol boat (PBR) for a most hostile and claustrophobic type of war: riverine combat. Now you\u2019ve been drafted.<br/><br/>The Colombian drug cartel. Loyal troops of a deposed Panamanian dictator. Renegade Viet Cong. They\u2019re on the river \u2014 waiting \u2014 around any river bend. Bullets rip through the thick jungle air as you maneuver your Gunboat through over 20 missions in hell. They swear the river will run red with your blood. But you\u2019ve got other orders.<br/><br/><ul><li>Enter 3 sweltering combat zones: Vietnam, Colombia, and Panama<br/></li><li>Operate a U.S. Navy River Patrol Boat (PBR) in over 20 missions. Three different maps, identifying target destinations and key sites on the river.<br/></li><li>Step into the abyss known as \u201cRiverine Operations.\u201d Your M60 smolders, cocked for yet another round. Spotlights and radar are fully functional. Soldiers, bridges, mines, docks, sampans, APC\u2019s and canyons are depicted in deadly detail.<br/></li><li>Get a first-person perspective from 4 battle stations. Fire salvos from the bow, stern and mid-section of the boat \u2013 or take the helm as pilot. All four men are cross-trained in each other\u2019s tasks \u2014 redundancy becomes crucial if one or two crew members are wounded or dead.<br/></li><li>Open fire with authentic gunboat weaponry. Twin .50 cal. M2HB machine guns, .30 cal. M60D general purpose machine guns, Mini-TAT rapid-fire gatling gun, mortars and grenade launchers.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86266847b2b502a7c22d3c67307626d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 8, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Accolade"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ziggurat", "Ziggurat Interactive", "Accolade"], "esrb_rating": null}
