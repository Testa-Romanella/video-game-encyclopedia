{"id": 256748, "slug": "pocket-bandits", "name": "Pocket Bandits", "name_original": "Pocket Bandits", "description": "The Game\r\n<p>This is an extreme game of pick-pocketing.\u00a0 There is a street scene where you will have to click on the pocket of one of the people. You will then have to steal items from their pocket.\u00a0The game consist of three items to steal; there are wallets, keys, and cell phones. But be careful when pulling items out of the pockets, if you shake to much or go to slow you will get caught. Getting caught entices a nice surprise, an angry citizen, you will have to slap them at just the right speed. The wrong speed will event in you getting a strike, and losing some items. So don't get caught.</p>\n<p>\"Why are we stealing random items?\"\u00a0 Your not! You will receive a checklist from your boss whom nobody knows the identity of. You will need to get all of these items before the two minute timer runs out, and before\u00a0you get three strikes. If you don't, you will be . . . taken care of. Any extra items of a type will be traded for cash money.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Game-play\r\n<p>\"How do I play?\" You might ask. I'll tell you. The people walking on the street, click on their pockets (Its OK they don't mind). Once in the pocket you only have so much time, so get your items out by dragging them. If you hit the edges of the pocket or move to much, the citizen will be more alert, so be careful. If you do get caught you will need to hit the space bar as the bar goes over the green area to slap them at just the right speed. That's all you need to know, at least . . . for now. At the end you will get your quota, depending on the time you have left when you finish, your strikes, and the money from any extra items. Let us know your best scores down in the comments, See who is the best pick-pocket.</p>\r\nThe Work Behind It\r\n<p>This was a project game for COMO Game Jam IV. We decided to go as young programmers and met a lot of people. If you don't know what a Game Jam is, it's an event that goes through anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks, and you have to make a game based on a theme. Our theme was \"swipe\". We decided to take the approach of swiping stuff from people. So we made a pick-pocketing game and went for a very potato-like art style.\u00a0The game is still fairly new, so if you find any glitches or bugs, let us know in the comments(Please be as detailed as possible).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236e495f749a3ea4742a963f4f944338.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tight Occasion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
