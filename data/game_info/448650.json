The idea was inspired by current world situation</p>\n<p>There are three unique levels that player can choose among to play, each one has unique setting and history. Every level has different enemy\u2019s spawns, what makes every level to have unique player\u2019s experience in terms of gameplay. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Player\u2019s main goal is to survive for certain amount of time to win. There are many zombies that are coming to destroy his base, base has certain amount of health points. As health points are less or equal then 0 \u2013 player lost.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The longer player survives \u2013 the stronger zombies are spawning and game becomes more difficult as player reaches certain time marks.
