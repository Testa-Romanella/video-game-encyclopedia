Construct a team of polygonal monsters called Microgons, and strategically maneuver them across a board to engage them in combat against the opposing team.  Don't be fooled by its lighthearted look, this is a hardcore game.<br/><br/>From teleporting, to setting fire to the ground, to building sentry guns, to shooting missiles, every Microgon has a unique special ability.  The board is procedurally generated, so you must draft your Microgons according to what best suits the battlefield.  You\u2019ll have to emergently combine your Microgon\u2019s abilities together in order to exploit your enemy\u2019s weaknesses to win!Key Features:<ul><li>Online 1v1 ranked matchmaking with MMR.<br/></li><li>Friend-Play: battle against your Steam friends.<br/></li><li>More than 20 unique Microgons to create your team from.<br/></li><li>Practice mode: play against a basic AI to practice with your team.<br/></li><li>High skill-cap: extreme level of depth.<br/></li><li>Very little RNG: win based on skill, not luck.<br/></li><li>Vaporwave inspired aesthetic.<br/></li><li>Procedurally generated boards.<br/></li><li>In-game music composed / produced by Donovan Hikaru </li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae2a656b02f400cc1f3a6a55dda56492.jpg", "website": "http://microgons.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 123}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOG HOGGLER"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["DOG HOGGLER"], "esrb_rating": null}
