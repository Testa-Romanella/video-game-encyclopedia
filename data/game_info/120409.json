This is not indicative of a full- fledged game.</strong></p><p>Falling Labyrinth is an arcade-y <strong>falling blocks puzzle game</strong> and <strong>first-person dungeon-crawling RPG</strong>. The objective is to collect the three items (indicated on the map as white squares), then reach the green square to fight the final boss and see your final score. You have a time limit and limited # of pieces to place which increase as you collect the three items.
