Grim would much prefer anything else.\u00a0His scythe training ceremony is imminent and he goes on an adventure he didn't expect, nor did his hamster, Mr Binky.</em></p>\n<p>Tailored slightly to accommodate the <strong>Adventure Game\u00a0Challenge</strong> at\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/106-adventure-game-challenge\u00a0this game begins fully voiced and music but begins to lose those bits the more you explore - I simply ran out of time to voice the remainder. The theme \"stranger in a strange land\" isn't really touched upon till the end.</p>\n<p>Regardless, this is a big learning curve for me. First time using Illustrator, first time using Unity and first time jumping into the deep end of building a Adventure\u00a0Creator game.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the game or concept, I fully intend to complete the game to its full potential.
