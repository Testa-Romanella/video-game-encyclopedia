Team up with up to 3 other players to conquer whatever foe may come at you.  Use makeshift weaponry like sticks, croquet mallets, flowers, and water guns to battle it out.  Live in a world where money is useless and Gummy is the currency of choice.<h3>Characters</h3><br/>Play as Roy, the star; the sullen Stick Master.  Wield his mighty stick Excalibur using a variety of close range and explosive techniques.  <br/><br/><br/>Like to stay farther away?  Maybe Charlotte is your game.  Use her various beams, projectiles, and fields to take control of the area.  <br/><br/><br/>Maybe you'd like to take a more supportive role?  Try Fatima!  She has a great arsenal of skills to heal or boost her allies.  <br/><br/><br/>If none of that is your style and you like to hit as hard as possible, check out Laila.  She also has some pretty decent range to go along with it.<h3>Combat System</h3>Use multiple skills and techniques to perform unique and open combos.  Have a look at the default control scheme:<br/><h3>Item shop</h3><br/>Buy a variety of food or equipment items and equip them to one of four slots.  Some items heal you instantly while others can restore your super meter.  Equipment effects can vary from boosting your damage output.<h3>Skill shop</h3><br/>Have you met Harry?  He can teach you how to play AND he can teach you new skills.  Swap out any technique for any other within the same category to customize whatever character you choose to match your own play style.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89b/89b3a9fbe71c4e747f26f423564cd608.jpg", "website": "https://www.chickenpicnic.com/neighborhood-game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chicken Picnic"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chicken Picnic"], "esrb_rating": null}
