It\r\nnever got anywhere and I thought it could be fun to do something with\r\nthem, so over a late summer month in 2016 I created the code,\r\npuzzles, story, additional graphics and released the game for the\r\nSinclair ZX Spectrum.<br/><br/>It's a simple menu driven graphical\r\ntext adventure. I tried to make it an accessible experience and you\r\ncan't die or make the game unwinnable. It's not a particularly hard\r\nnor long game, but it was fairly well received when released.<br/><br/>The game is also available in Spanish\r\nthanks to Radastan.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n\n<p>This game requires at least a 48k ZX\r\nSpectrum (or a suitable emulator) to play.<br/><br/>To load the game: LOAD \"\"<br/><br/>Use a Kempston Joystick (Up, Down and\r\nFire) or the Keyboard (Q, A and Space).<br/></p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game by: <strong>Ersh</strong><br/>Spanish Translation: <strong>Radastan<br/></strong><br/>Tools used: pasmo, zx7, mackarel<br/>Logo font: Betty Noir</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec273298ea28d2b7d5b05e962ed71184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ersh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
