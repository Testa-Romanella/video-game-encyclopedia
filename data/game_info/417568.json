The units are always \"clamped\" to a rate of a maximum of 40% special units and 60% basic penguin units.</p>**IMPORTANT : In the current state of the game you are only allowed to buy units and see them fight, any ideas on how we should proceed with this :P ?***IMPORTANT 2: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL WIP GAME **\r\n<p>Meaning, you are most likely to encounter several bugs, also that the game \"concept\" is not finished, its just an idea, a prototype, so at the end of the road this game can be very, VERY different of what it is now, so we will be open to ANY, ANY feedback you could give us :), Deadlycrow Games is growing to be a company that makes games WITH and FOR the community! so yeah! your words are really important for us!,\u00a0 that said, we hope you like this silly little game :) !!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/71990e73426dcbf5028315a3a1694ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deadlycrow Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
