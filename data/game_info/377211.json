This game is very simple, you can place towers to kill enemies, the more enemies you kill the better the towers you can place with the money you gain, I made a difficulty setting so that the game can either be easy or fairly challenging depending on the player and I also decided to add in some music just to liven the game up a small bit. This is one of my first made games so any constructive feedback would be really appreciated as coding for me is extremely difficult! \u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T04:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/9144b4a1378464817b6d422ca4b9a2db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ad4m"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
