{"id": 307839, "slug": "robotfight-wip", "name": "RobotFight (WIP)", "name_original": "RobotFight (WIP)", "description": "<p>RobotFight is a top view 3D fighting game as you play robots trying to destroy the enemy to win a BestOf9 competition. There is no age restriction as the controls, the goals and the graphics are very simple. My inspirations are <em>MarioKart :\u00a0Double Dash</em>, <em>Cho'Gall</em>'s <em>Heroes of the Strom</em> hero and <em>Baby-foot</em>.</p>\n<p>The game is played with <strong>two controllers</strong> but is meant to be played with <strong>four players</strong> : each robot is controlled by two players, one moving the robot with the half-left controller, the other aiming and attacking with the right-half controller. I'll add a mechanic to allow Pilot and Fighter to swap role in the middle of the fight soon. Menu is mouse only for the moment.</p>\n<p>I started with a Pen&amp;Paper prototype to test if players enjoyed playing with/against each other in this tandem-like fighting game. It went very well so I prototyped it on PC. Players enjoyed it much more thanks to real-time dynamic, the ability to deflect projectiles and so on as my playtests showed me.</p>\n<p>I'm making this game <strong>t</strong><strong>argeting\u00a0Nintendo Switch platform</strong>\u00a0since each player have two to three inputs and is the most popular party game console. Feel free to comment or give advices ! :)<br/></p>\n<p>You may encounter some bugs as it's a WIP and I'm sorry for this, keep me informed and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can. You can use F5 to reload a Round\u00a0while keeping the score as it is or Esc to return to the Main Menu.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Credits for main theme :</em></p>\n<p><em>Music from https://filmmusic.io:<br/>\"Onion Capers\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>Licence: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T05:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b218487d990ba40a073a2ea723d540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JeremyOssolaGD"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
