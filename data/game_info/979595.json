You are the Architect, not the commander.<br/><br/>- Singleplayer campaign; budgeted challenges. Send your fleets to fight escalating battles to take down The Oppressor.<br/>- Asychronous Multiplayer - alright alright, not true async-multi, but you can share your fleets with other people and import their fleets to battle against.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Build ships</strong> out of individual building blocks, using a gridless port system that allows you to build in either straight and orderly fashion, or wobbly and wonderful ways.<br/><br/>Each block can be broken individually, allowing ships to shatter into pieces. How you build your ship is very important to its structural integrity.<br/><br/>Many shapes of block, allowing you to build in rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, and penrose styles.<br/>Many weapon types, filling the needs of anything from brawler battleships to elegant artillery vessels.<br/><br/>Ships have movement physics requiring you to think a little about where you put your engines.<br/>Ship systems use energy, requiring you to plan out what you can and cannot afford to have on board.<br/><br/><strong>Compose fleets</strong> using your ships. Place them in strong formations, or just splay them out across your allotted space. Either way, fleet tactics and force composition will win the day.<br/><br/>You don't control the ships when they are in battle - you are only the Architect.<br/>It's up to you to design your ships, compose your fleet, and configure their behavior to perform to their best in battle.<br/><br/><strong>Singleplayer Campaign</strong><br/>A large set of challenge battles that will test your skills in ship architecture and fleet composition.
