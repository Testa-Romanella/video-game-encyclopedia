However, there's still a bit of life wanting to make its way into these wastelands.<br/></p>\n<p>Not satisfied with simply eating, sleeping and avoiding being eaten, this hybrid of cetacean and person moves heaven, earth, (and the sea that hardly remains) to give a proper education to a generation of humans born from this post-apocalyptic world.
