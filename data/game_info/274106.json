But think carefully before you do anything!\u00a0\u00a0Your two most important resources,\u00a0<em>fuel and oxygen</em>, are limited! Take too long and you'll suffocate, but jump too often and you may find yourself stranded. Fortunately for you, this planet seems to have these little orbs of energy, that give you a little bit more oxygen\u00a0 in your reserves, so it's not\u00a0<em>all</em> doom and gloom!</p>\n<p>Your scoring for each level is based on how much time you have remaining until you run out of oxygen by the time you land inside the teleporter. So, do you sacrifice a few extra jumps to give yourself a faster route to the teleporter, or do you take the safer route you know will have you clear the level, but at the cost of a better score. The choice is yours to make!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How To Play</em><br/></strong></p>\n<p>In order to fling your astronaut around the level, simply <strong>click anywhere</strong> on the astronaut's body, and <strong>drag the mouse outwards</strong> from there. The <strong>further you drag, the more power</strong> the shot will have. When you <strong>r</strong><strong>elease the mouse</strong>, the astronaut will shoot off in the opposite direction you dragged in, like a cosmic slingshot!</p>\n<p>https://imgur.com/a/a5xjU8o<br/></p>\n<p>That's all you need to know, but you make want to know that you can quickly restart any level by pressing\u00a0<em><strong>R</strong></em>, and you can also return to the level select screen from any level by pressing<strong>\u00a0</strong><em><strong>L</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh and one final note: we don't currently have the option to turn volume settings down, so you may want to take this into account before playing!</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Credits</strong></em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Art &amp; Animation:\u00a0Ayo Norman-Williams</li><li>Scripting, Sound,\u00a0&amp; Implementation:\u00a0Thomas Robson</li><li>Music &amp; Game Concept:\u00a0Dalvia Dhillon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b5b876fb58c3da4620130cd1dbf65a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TomRobson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
