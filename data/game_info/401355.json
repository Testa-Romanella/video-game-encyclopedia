It is up to you to choose the right path out of the situation while still keeping everything you've picked up with you to the end. If the wrong choices are made, then you can find yourself in a stolen police car or face to face with an ancient god, so it's probably best to make it home safely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfb08d87fe3331ce31aa71266b364b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jwfreeman"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
