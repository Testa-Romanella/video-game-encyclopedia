The user will become the artist who accidentally finds this discarded AI online and starts to have conversations with it. He is very old-school and refuses to apply new technology in his drawing, though his work is no longer appreciated by the world. One day he leaves his unfinished project on the computer, and when he returns, he finds that the AI has finished the work for him through generative art. The work is amazing and wins him a lot of praise, which makes him reevaluate AI art and embrace it in his creation.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9a9fafafea7366ace3f49c32a878a3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jl10902@nyu.edu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
