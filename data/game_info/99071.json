Get a friend or a stranger, a controller and have a nice relaxing time in our little museum.</p><p>You'll express your thoughts and feelings towards art with cards, or try to view the world as your peer and guess the cards he or she has played. Comparing cards will prompt conversation and is sure to connect you two.</p><p>This game was originally made in 48 hours by <strong>Neverpants</strong> (Dom2D, technobeanie &amp; seventysevian), featuring art both classic and new, with contributions by many amazing artists like Anthony Clark, Justin Chan, Nic ter Horst, Tom Eccles, Aliceffekt and way more! We've spent a little bit of time polishing it and adding art and cards since.</p><p>Randomly generated from a database of over 200 \u201cpaintings\" and a multitude of cards, the <strong>Museum of Parallel Art</strong> is different every time you visit. For more information check out our blog at neverpants.com!</p><p><strong>Note: Press ESC once, then right-click to go Full Screen! </strong>It's way better that way!</p><p>I recommend downloading the standalone version (Mac or PC available!), using an Xbox 360 Controller, and obviously, playing with someone! ^_^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/160/160f31bbfc8a39c7a9b860f22a7df037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Neverpants"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
