During the run every killed enemy will leave on the ground XPs, energy and/or weapon modules.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Fast and Fun</strong><br/>Atomine is fast. There are a lot of enemies and you have to kill all of them to complete the levels. But don't worry, you have infinite ammo and a (great) modular weapon system.<br/><br/><strong>Weapon System</strong><br/>In Atomine the player can modify his weapon using special modules that can be find in the game. The modules have effect to specific parts of the weapons: type of bullet, number of bullets, rate of fire and other mutators.<br/><br/><strong>Procedural Generated / Roguelite</strong><br/>The world of Atomine is composed by levels procedurally-generated. Every level has different type of enemy and environment. <br/>The player has to complete all levels with only one life. If Atomine is destroyed, the game is over.<br/><br/><strong>Counter Hacking</strong><br/>During a run, the system can detect the intrusion and modify the game, so player must act quickly! <br/>If the player fails to hijack the counter hacking maneuver, the challenge will become really tough. <br/><br/><strong>Boss Battle</strong><br/>There are not only \"small\" enemies. Atomine must also defeat big and powerful bosses. <br/><br/><br/>In 2011, Sergey Ulasen, discovered STUXNET, a malicious computer worm, initially spreaded via Microsoft Windows, and targeted Siemens industrial control systems, defined as a sleeping threat, waiting for a trigger to start its activation.
