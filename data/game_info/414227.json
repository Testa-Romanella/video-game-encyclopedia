Play as Jim Bob; the noble, dignified, adventurous, clumsy hero of our story, which takes place on a hot summer day in the Kalahari Desert.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Made for the Brackeys2020 Game Jam where the theme was: Hole. (I think I nailed it on the theme)</p>\n<p>\u00a0I didn't get this submission done in time to submit it but it was still a lot of fun to make. First crack at (super basic) procedurally generating levels, with theoretically infinite gameplay loop. Depends how masochistic/bored you are.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this hole I dug!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD / Arrow Keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:03:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unholy Cathar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
