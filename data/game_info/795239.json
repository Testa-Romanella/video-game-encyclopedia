I have uploaded the video for you to see. Please check out the video it is essential to the flow of the game.\u00a0</p><p>-Also, the game is only a couple scenes once you get to the end where the game is black and white and just drawn that is the end of the prototype.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What Works:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- the mini game in between the first dialog and the player can move to next scene by walking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whats Not working:</p>\n<p>- I have the cut Scenes working but for some reason i cant export it correctly?!</p>\n<p>This is a game I plan on making about working together in order to survive. I plan on the game being a playable short story about two rebels on the run who find themselves in a sticky situation. I hope that development goes well and you guys enjoy.</p>\n<p>Prototype: I just wanted to work out how cut scenes would be incorporated. I really want it to be a story game so its heavy on the cutscenes and art but i also want it to still be a playable game and i expect to add more minigames as like in the beginning before you crash there is a quick minigame to be played of dodging asteroids. I am worried because i don't have the best art skills and i have high expectations and I'm not sure ill be able to achieve what i want.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T16:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625e6fcf3af8745fdd311acf1e399853.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Danyel Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
