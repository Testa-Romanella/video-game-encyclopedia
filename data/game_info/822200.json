{"id": 822200, "slug": "escape-from-dice-jail", "name": "Escape from Dice Jail", "name_original": "Escape from Dice Jail", "description": "<p>Escape From Dice Jail is about a sentient D20 who's girlfriend got thrown into dice jail for rolling poorly, and now it's your job to find her and free her.</p>\n<p>Your main method of movement is rolling. On your turn, you can use your mouse cursor to control the direction of your roll, and decide how much power you put into it by holding down the Left Mouse Button, then let go to launch. (The power of your roll is indicated by the bar in the top left of your screen during gameplay). You can slow yourself at any time during the roll by holding the Space Bar.</p>\n<p>There are enemy Minifigures that are trying to stop you from freeing your girlfriend, and will attack you if they get close enough. If you roll into an enemy, a DAMAGE CAM\u2122 will appear in the top right of your screen, showing how much damage you will do to it when you stop. Try bouncing into multiple enemies to maximize damage!</p><p>There is a known bug where if you leave the game with the pause menu, the win screen, or the lose screen, there is a chance that\u00a0you won't be able to\u00a0play again without force quitting. Another known bug is that if you kill all of the enemies the game will soft lock. If you want to finish the game, do not kill all of the enemies.\u00a0I wanted to get a WebGL build up, but I didn't have time.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank my Dad, who provided the vast majority of the art,\u00a0 Mark and his team at GMTK for hosting this awesome Game Jam, and\u00a0Brackeys for all of his very helpful tutorials.\u00a0Finally, I would like to dedicate this game to my friend Sam, who is a super awesome guy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/7800d6eca30ce7949f4bccde6dbd1f1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheQiwiBoy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
