You must get off the ice sheet before it collapses. On your way, you will gather and analyze data about the ice.<br/><br/><br/>Make your way over the collapsing ice sheet by jumping, sliding, and climbing. Reach abandoned research stations and gather data in a series of mini-games. Analyze the data and uncover what is happening to the climate.<h3>INVESTIGATE AND LEARN</h3><br/>The Tipping Point is a 3D side-scroller developed in collaboration with real world researchers in an interdisciplinary effort (physicists, biologists, chemists, statisticians, and more). The things you do in The Tipping Point are based on what researchers do in the arctic in real life.<br/><br/><br/>As researchers do, you will compare the data you collect to previous data sets and investigate changes in the climate.<h3>UNCOVER WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE ICE</h3>Solve the mystery of the tipping point and why the ice sheet is suddenly collapsing.<h3>THANKS TO</h3>Funded by <strong>EU Horizon 2020</strong>, <strong>The Novo Nordisk Foundation</strong>, and <strong>NordForsk</strong>, The Tipping Point is and will forever be available for free.<br/><br/>The research groups that contributed to the development of The Tipping Point are:<br/><ul><li><strong>TiPES</strong> is a large scientific collaboration with the aim to enhance the understanding of tipping points in the earth system. 18 partner institutions work together in more than 10 countries.
