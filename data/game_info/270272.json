I'm interested in using video game mechanics and the multiplayer format to create tectonic forms and configurations.</p>\n<p>The game itself parodies architectural 3D modeling software from the first-person perspective. Players 'build' constructions to traverse between platforms and collect blue artifacts. Each artifact triggers a change in gravity and generates a new platform and artifact to move toward. Each shift allows you to see and interact with your construction from a new perspective.</p>\n<p>At the end, export your construction as an OBJ file!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b07305f19359c66973455df7d764954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["j_fleming"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
