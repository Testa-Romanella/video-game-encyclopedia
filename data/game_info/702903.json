So, we went to our college and searched for Computer Science students to join in. We were full of hope and optimism, but it quickly turned into one of the hardest and most rewarding challenges we\u2019ve ever done.</p>\n<p>We plan to Finish the game and make it\u00a0 complete. This is what we could get to to submit for the contest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In summary, please enjoy our slapdash little game :)</p>\n<p>What people our saying about are game</p>\n<p>\"It's a feature not a bug.\"- My cousin when playing this game</p>\n<p>\"Why does this not work?\" - My Friend Tom</p>\n\n<p>\"Is that it?\" -Greg my Plummer</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm still proud of you.\" -Grandma\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"I felt like I was playing Mega Man again, for like a couple of seconds and then I realized I had no idea what was going on\u00a0\" - Nate\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"ThIs\u00a0GaMe SuUcKS I Can't See\" - A guy in my Math class</p>\n\n<p>\"I could do more in a day then you could in an entire month.\" David my friend</p>\n\n<p>\"I\u00a0wasn't in for more then 10 seconds and\u00a0 I broke it,\u00a0\u00a0you only get one working run so don't\u00a0mess up \"\u00a0\u00a0-My Cousin</p>\n\n<p>\"No, I\u00a0don't like viruses\" - Trash can dweller</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf this game were an animal it would be a baby dung beetle. Small, ineffective and covered in crap, but with the potential to grow into an interesting, unique game. The more I played this game the more I began to question. What is this game? Why am I playing it? Am I really good enough friends with this guy to put myself through this? Why did my character go invisible? Where is the exit screen? All these questions and more floated through my mind as I struggled to understand this game. In the end, the game has potential and could be refined into something with a little more time and effort.\" - My best Friend</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T06:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4db964f94b262ddadce1d428f888fb1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PatyCake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
