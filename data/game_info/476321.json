Controls are WASD to move, 1-6 to change form, or click the buttons, or press Q and E\u00a0to cycle through them. Whatever floats your boat! On easy difficulty the obstacles will be the same color as the form you need to clear them, on medium they each have a reasonable unique color, and on hard they are the same color as everything else, also the world will fall apart really fast.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Programming - Tyler Smith (@loadsofmana),\u00a0</p><p>Art -\u00a0Damien Flores, Tyler Smith</p><p>Music - Dekkanoid</p><p>SFX and Voices - Tyler Smith, Damien Flores</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef84a5e0174daf8095e7f061338e436d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["loadsofmana"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
