The red dice controls the red platforms, and the blue dice controls the blue ones. Once the dices roll an odd number, the platforms disappear, and you can no longer step on them. To be able to step on the platforms again, you have to wait for the dices to roll again, once the number they roll is even, you can step on them again.</p>\r\nInfo :\r\n<p>This was a really fun adventure. Getting to make a game with not much experience without using assets or doing pixel art like everyone else put us and our software to the test. Even tho we had bigger ambitions for the project, time was limited but we hope that you like it and that we can deliver a more polished &amp; feature rich experience when the voting period is over.</p>\n<p>If you gave our game a chance we would like to hear your feedback.</p>\n<p>Thank You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T19:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/595b2adc8c6263dfe2d86ecf0a8a3e24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E-VOL-V", "Maaaars", "Melonii"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
