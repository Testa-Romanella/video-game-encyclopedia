Any area with a shadok on one side and no shadok on the other falls down because of its occupant's weight. \u00a0Unluckily, these little birds won't figure it out.</p>\n<p>That's why the Gibis came over from their nearby planet to save them! Set the gibis on the right places so that the shadoks don't fall into space!</p>\n<p>The game is played with mouse only. No fancy controls.</p>\n<p>It's been developed over two days for Ludum Dare 46's compo. I've made everything from scratch except the font (Bahnschrift) using Unity, C#, Blender, sfxr, Bosca Ceoil, Audacity and Adobe Photoshop. To create the original spacerock texture, I transformed two free texture packs available on https://3dtextures.me. Also, everything is inspired, of course, by the original design of the Shadoks. That's why I opted-out the \"Mood\" category.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb890d4278a2dd0c2f822ad047210f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ramo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
