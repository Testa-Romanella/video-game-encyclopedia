If we don't stop it here, it will rule us pretty soon. In-game stats show how many matches the AI has won vs humans.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play with your friend like the good ol' days.<br/></p>\n<p>Originally developed by Quin Pendragon (Fractoid) / Daniel Wedge (Wedgey) for Java 10+ years ago (oneslime.net).<br/></p>\n<p>        I don't want to take credit for other people's work. I enjoyed playing this game back in the day at school. This remake is a side project to bring the nostalgic fun back since the original version doesn't work anymore... well unless you want to enable java applets in your browser.        </p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy playing this game!
