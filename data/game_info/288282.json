Walk into objects or people to interact with them!</p>\n<p>The idyllic community of Sunshine Town has been stricken by a Giant Lizard Incident. It has been 24 hours since the first reports, but the Country Rangers have finally arrived on the scene to help. What has everyone done about the damage to their homes? What was most important about <em>home</em> to them?<br/><br/>The game is made with Bitsy by Adam Le Doux. It's pure vanilla Bitsy, which is unusual for me. For anyone asking \"How did you get so many colours?\" the extended palette can be obtained by editing the game data - see the Bitsy FAQ!</p>\n<p>The music was created with BeepBox, and added using the Add Bitsy Audio tool by candle, which is an invaluable alternative to trying to make Chrome Autoplay work by hand.<br/></p>\n<p>This has been an almost solo project, but credit must be delivered to my eternal co-conspirator in art, the miraculous onion, for the\u00a0<em>excellent</em> picture of the otherwise unseen Stompy Boi.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Source code and assets used in the game are released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial ShareAlike 4.0 international licence.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f927eda995e343c506133be9c7cbfb2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ducklingsmith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
