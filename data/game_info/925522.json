The heroes are set to explore a dungeon with the promise of finding great treasures. On their advancement through the labyrinth of the dungeon, players encounter various monsters that drop useful items upon slaying them. The items that can be found include weapons, spells, treasure chests, and keys to unlock them. A legend says that a dragon guarding a great treasure resides in these dungeons.</p>\n<p>The game ends when the dragon is slain.
