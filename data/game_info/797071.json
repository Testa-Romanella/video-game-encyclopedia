I worked as a solo developer to test out what I have learned so far about making games. the idea was to have the character use 3rd person combat and have multiple levels but after a few issues I had to reduce scope and couldn't add in the extra fun features I wanted to. I may come back to this in the future to really finish what this game should be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T17:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f4eae4c83d8babc6366a2bae4a78e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadowstorm5400"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
