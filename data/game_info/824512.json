A giant lemon used to breathe life into the world of slash. With no one to take care of it, it has spread mold everywhere. The only way to revive the lemon is to reach it! Slash your way to it and save the lemon!</p>\n<p>This is a demo build. It's basically the same game it just ends a bit earlier than it should and lacks the amount of play testing/ polish that I want. Please give me feedback.</p><p>Default controls use the arrow keys, but can be changed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T15:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8bb5ef883791afd21983d71f30dbd3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bdleelee"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
