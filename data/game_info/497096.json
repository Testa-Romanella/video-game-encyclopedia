All art and music are placeholders, and the level design and combat balance aren't yet optimal. As of right now, there is only one area in the game: the Vestibule Wastes.</p>\n<p>At the moment, I'm operating solo, with no budget, so the idea of Deadbeat becoming a complete game is still a far-off dream. My current plan is to form a development team and get to the point where I'm confident enough to run a Kickstarter, but currently that's all up in the air.<br/></p>\n<p>If you're someone who can assist in the following areas and would be interested in joining such a team, please let me know!<br/>-Music/Sound Design<br/>-Art/Spritework<br/>-Level\u00a0Design</p>\n<p>Either way, I'd be more than happy to get your feedback at my Discord channel here!<br/></p>\n<p>-MkfShard/Halfwheel<br/>Twitter: @Mkfshard</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Sound Effects and Music:<br/>99Sounds<br/>One Man\u00a0Symphony<br/>Jute<br/>artisticdude</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b124946084650228bc1c69f94098f0d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Halfwheel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
