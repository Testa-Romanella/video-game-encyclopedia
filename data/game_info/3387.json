{"id": 3387, "slug": "bloodborne", "name": "Bloodborne", "name_original": "Bloodborne", "description": "<p>Bloodborne is an action-RPG and another member of souls-like title series. The game has no predecessors or successors, making it the only entry with one add-on: \u201cThe Old Hunters.\u201d The Bloodborne universe, however, also includes a comics and a board game.</p>\n<p>Generally resembling the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, however, has some different mechanics and the pace of combat is increased thanks to the risk-rewarding battle system. Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other players invading your playthrough.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter. You meet horrific bosses, explore vast areas, houses and open spaces while continually dodging, attacking and trying not to get killed by a massive number of hostile NPCs.</p>", "metacritic": 92, "released": "2015-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T16:30:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/214/214b29aeff13a0ae6a70fc4426e85991.jpg", "website": "https://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/bloodborne/", "rating": 4.41, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 566, "owned": 5048, "beaten": 1479, "toplay": 489, "dropped": 625, "playing": 261}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 90, "ratings_count": 2376, "suggestions_count": 607, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 2409, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["FromSoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
