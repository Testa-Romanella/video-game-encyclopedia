{"id": 744446, "slug": "concoction-collector", "name": "Concoction Collector", "name_original": "Concoction Collector", "description": "<p><strong>Concoction Collector</strong> is a 2D deck-building roguelike featuring Baldrik, a knight who ended up working as a field medic in the war, so the only way he knows how to fight is using dangerous concoctions !</p>\n<p><strong>The game features a unique battle </strong><strong>system</strong> where each card needs to be played every round, but the order they are played in is what matters. Couple in the fact that you can attempt to dodge most attacks, and be ready for some tense situations where you stop thinking which cards you are playing but how you are playing them.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The game features</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>16 Potions, each with its own unique effect</li><li>17 Items, to spice up your builds</li><li>2 Levels and 2 Bosses at the end of each</li><li>5 Monsters, each with a unique attacking style and pattern</li><li>1 Shopkeeper, used to mix potions together, acting as a card-removal service with an extra benefit.</li><li>Ability to speed up animations</li><li>Short text based in-game tutorial to get you started</li></ul>\n\n<p>This project was originally made as a college project, but I might end up working on it in the future. However, the game will most likely in that case be ported to Godot</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> for the music go to these wonderful authors on OpenGameArt.org:</p>\n<ul><li>nene for the first battle theme and second boss theme</li><li>Joth for the first boss theme</li><li>Pro Sensory for the main menu theme</li><li>Spring Spring for the second battle theme</li><li>Trex0n for shopkeeper Katrina's theme</li><li>RandomMind for the tutorial music</li></ul>\n<p>And a <strong>huge</strong> thanks to my best friends, who helped playtest the game for me, leading up to a relatively bug free product. Love you all.</p>\n<p>And thank you for playing the game if you decide to do so. Hopefully you can get as much fun out of it as it was for me to create it, and I hope it makes you smile at least a little. Have a nice day.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:04:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a13a4564d0e9e513a338d388d1776ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["BeakBrain Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
