Specifically focusing on the ambient lighting type and how the suns and planets should light the scene as well as how the ships specular lighting should respond.\u00a0The main scene may take\u00a0a long time to load, so give it a couple minutes to come up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>F1 brings up a help menu for controls.</p><p>You can fly around, fire torpedos, get near planets, and even 'go to warp'.\u00a0</p><p>In the last few builds I have worked on optimization by reducing the number of lights needed and started setting up emissive materials to cut down on the draw calls around the ship. So far it has gained something like 30-40% performance through simple changes, so hopefully it is playable on older hardware.</p><p>Let me know of any suggestions or further optimizations it could get in the comments.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdff866a89e01e254a3535fd79575030.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Salty Sea Dogs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
