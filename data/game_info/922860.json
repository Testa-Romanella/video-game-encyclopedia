To progress in the levels, the player must die, before playing as the next intern, who uses the corpses of those who came before them as stepping stones to proceed.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to progress through the levels, but the map is littered with unreasonably difficult traps that the player cannot get through on first try. To complete full achievement, the player must die strategically to disable the traps, before moving forward and facing new challenges.</p>\n<p>The main narrative of the game is still under development, however we aim to tell a satirical story that critiques the\u00a0capitalist system and the way that most careers treat newcomers to their trade.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>= Game Docs =</strong></p>\n<p>* <strong>Game Pitch :</strong>\u00a0 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zq2XM2IhUAO-LTnJNNai3tJPCVDyU9XC/edit?us... <br/>* <strong>Creative Brief : </strong>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RRUM4RPN5GI00J2Bzej9NOyzi-4BkATTE4oa4p3kFAo/...* <strong>Design Doc :</strong>\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-_mryuh4NQRXO8amaQD-dnLV52H-dvRg73jjnoFm_s/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T10:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bf51928addc062dc3799f816726ffa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LatestBright", "Blucia", "Jason Chao", "thefatlazycat", "jasperjschen", "Temigina", "AlamgirK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
