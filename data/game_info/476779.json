You may get frustrated at the other party, but isn't it also equally your fault?</p>\n<p>Blockage is a new game for the NES. It can be played on an original console, AVS, or Analogue NT\u00a0using a Powerpak, or on a modern emulator such as Mesen or FCEUX.</p>\n<p>The demo has 32 levels, and is downloadable now for free!</p>\n<p>A full version is still in development, and will include 100 levels, plus secret rewards. The game is still in active development, so as new features are added to the game, the demo will also be updated.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Scott</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6ee1ecb21ee068f0f2b10680bce798e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScottThePhD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
