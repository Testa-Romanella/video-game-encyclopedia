Just kidding, playing this game is totally normal...<br/>well, at least I think so. <br/><br/>So, how are you feeling? Are you feeling stressed? <br/>If you are, don't worry, I'm here to help you relax. And to brighten up your day, here's an anime girl for you! (I'm sorry, girls... of course, you can play too if you want. It's a matter of personal taste. Actually, I'll make a separate game for you as well. And to the fluffy/furry-loving guy, I'll make a puzzle game for you too. And to the attack helicopter loving person... I'm not sure if I can make a game for you...)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Her name is Aori. She's a bit weird. Weird like she disappears every time I take my medication. <br/>Anyway, I hope you understand. <br/>I hope that you two get along.<br/><br/>I designed this game as a not-too-difficult puzzle game, and I hope it helps you relieve your stress. I thought, why stress out for no reason? So, I didn't want it to be too difficult.<br/><br/>The game has a zoom feature. You can double-click or scroll to zoom in on the pictures in the gallery. (I wanted to mention this in case you want to do some scientific research.. haha, very funny lol..)<br/><br/>There's a music player in the game, so you can dance while you play.. or you can just turn it off if you don't like it. I understand if you say \"What is this **** music?\". Everyone has the right to play the game in silence and peace, right? <br/><br/>As for the game's length, my personal motto is \"Good things usually don't last long.\" So, I wanted to keep it short and sweet. I'm open to your feedback on this.<br/><br/>This is my first game on Steam, so your feedback is very important to me. I believe that I can develop more successful games based on your feedback. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T04:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd1b6c60e68cfb8dd456ddf73fd85bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["simplecakestudio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["simplecakestudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
