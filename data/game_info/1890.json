All the objects in Cogs are three dimensional, so it needs to be manipulated on different faces which could wrap around the object, or consider sides of tiles. The player has the ability to turn the object in any manner he or she wants to complete the task. <br />\nIn the Cogs, the player mostly has to manipulate various gears, pipes with steam gas which purpose is to drive motors of gears or fill balloons and bell strikers which plays a specific melody if manipulated correctly. There are lots of levels in the game and each of them is more difficult than the previous one, adding more puzzle elements and more objects to manipulate.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2009-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:44:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1bde44ad4c3164f81d1249f866ad83c.jpeg", "website": "http://www.cogsgame.com", "rating": 2.73, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 72, "owned": 1713, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 57, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 108, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 108, "platforms": ["Linux", "iOS", "macOS", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Lazy 8 Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Lazy 8 Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
