Try to rotate around the planet as many times as you can without crashing into it or leaving the orbit.</p>\n<p>Every time you complete a turn around the orbit, the planet creates a new moon that will follow the same path as the one you took.</p>\n<p>Each consecutive moon will be faster. The planet has its own gravity, so you move faster as you get closer to the planet - the same goes for other moons.</p><p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulsar/id1417966886?ls=1&amp;mt=8\u00a0- check out the\u00a0iOS version if you want to play Pulsar on the go!</p><p>Created in 48h\u00a0for <strong>Slavic Game Jam 2018</strong> which took place on July 20-22nd 2018\u00a0in Warsaw, Poland.</p>\n<p>Made by:\u00a0Luke\u00a0Spierewka (@Spierek),\u00a0Weronika Grabowska (wrrnk @ FB),\u00a0Kamila Rusiecka, Elie Abraham (@ElieAbraham64) and Pawe\u0142\u00a0Laskowski\u00a0(@AlterKot).</p>\n<p>Fonts used: Potra, Nasalization</p>\n<p>Special thanks: Katarzyna Kruszy\u0144ska</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca7fdb4cdf392f4fdd38d9132c50fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Afterburn", "wrnk"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
