Each level has a minimum length the water must flow (remaining blocks shown in bottom right). Some levels have special end pieces, where your chain of pipes\u00a0must end in order to pass the level. Other special pieces include bonus points and reservoir pieces, special blockers, and one way pieces which show up in your queue in later levels. Also, some borders will be marked with arrows, which means that flow can wrap around to the other side. You can build pipes over existing pipes for a points and time penalty.\u00a0 Every few levels you have a bonus level, where you instead shift pipe pieces in a sliding-block style puzzle. You can click the start pipe, press F, or use the menu to \"fast forward\" pipe flow.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic Pipe Dream/Mania\u00a0gameplay,\u00a0\u00a0</strong>with speed gradually increasing through the levels.</li><li><strong>Bonus puzzle levels</strong> for extra points.</li><li><strong>Special pieces</strong> to add to the challenge and gameplay variety.</li><li><strong>Tiny, unobtrusive graphics</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Micro Mode</strong>\u00a0- The game only occupies a fraction of your\u00a0screen real estate, and can even be displayed in half size on high DPI displays, making it perfect for discreetly playing at work or while watching something on your computer.</li></ul>\n<p>Currently I prioritise mac binaries, as that's the only platform I play these games on, but am also building for other platforms (they will be up in February).\u00a0They are written in Rust and have a dependency on C libraries SDL2 and SDL_gfx.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T08:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eea8ed856fb7e722a4f6b215682ca271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Liam O'Connor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
