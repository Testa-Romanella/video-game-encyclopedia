To move the robot you will get some pathsections for each room, which you must place correctly, so that there is a path from the robot to the door that leads to the next room. </p><p>To install you simply download the AIWeaver.zip file and extract it, then you just have to open the game by opening the AIWeaver.exe file.</p><p>The controls in game are as follows:</p><p>Q and E are used to change the current pathsection</p><p>WASD and the keyboard arrows are used to move the current pathsection</p><p>Space is used to change between pathplacing mode and move mode</p><p>The escape key exits the game to the main menu.</p><p>There is no button that actually places the pathsections yet, they work where they are.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/150ae4a0a4145b71fcd67b4855ea5300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kriloff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
