The END is near these days!</p>\n<p>I\u00b4ve been using FREE SPRITES only - and some character sprites I still had from my other game projects. The soundtrackis something special. I tried to re-create classic 80s Songs to add a little contrast to the game. See if it works!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is basically finished but would need way, way more polishing. I know I\u00a0dont have the time to do that...
