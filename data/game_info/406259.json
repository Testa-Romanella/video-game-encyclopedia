I hope you enjoy this, because I'm pretty proud of it.</p>\n<p>I wrote this on a plane ride, so I don't exactly remember what this game was supposed to be about, but I think it's still pretty cool, so it's probably fine.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Text &amp; Words. What a shocker.</li><li>A wonderful beeping sound that you will definitely be sick of by the time you finish.</li><li>A frog, somewhere.
