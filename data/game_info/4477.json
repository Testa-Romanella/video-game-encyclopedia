Dog Days is the continuation of infamous Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men. This time the player controls Lynch - a psychopath who now lives in Hong-Kong with his love Xiu. Kane, the protagonist of the first game, comes to Hong-Kong in hopes to get some money by smuggling guns to Africa together with Lynch, but at the very beginning of the game Lynch decides to do a little job with local mafia and Kane accidentally shoots a girlfriend of influential mafia person and everyone, starting with local hooligans, police and then military turns against the two. <br />\nKane &amp; Lynch: Dog Days differs from all the other third person shooters by its original visual style and presentation. Everything what player sees is filtered by lo-fi visual effects and so everything looks like filmed with an old and cheap digital photo camera. The screen is shaking all the time, censuring wounds of shot enemies, colors of screen drastically changes when Lynch is wounded. The rhythm of the game is insanely quick to the point where it gets surreal.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2010-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T16:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b50/b501727147644474562935f19a60134e.jpg", "website": "http://www.KaneandLynch.com", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 157, "owned": 2586, "beaten": 403, "toplay": 52, "dropped": 142, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 120, "ratings_count": 494, "suggestions_count": 578, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 497, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "IO Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
