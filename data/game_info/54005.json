{"id": 54005, "slug": "rc-pro-am", "name": "R.C. Pro-Am", "name_original": "R.C. Pro-Am", "description": "<p>R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game developed by Rare. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo for North America in March 1988, and then in Europe on April 15 of the same year. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled car around a series of tracks. The objective of each track is to qualify for the next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. Originally titled Pro Am Racing, R.C. Pro-Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. R.C. Pro-Am was followed by two sequels: Super R.C. Pro-Am in 1991, and R.C. Pro-Am II in 1992.<br />\nListed by video game reviewers as one of Rare&#39;s first successful NES titles, R.C. Pro-Am was well-received for its visuals, sound, gameplay, and enjoyability. The game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead, instead of a first-person, perspective. Reviews have cited it as inspiration for future games such as Super Off Road, Rock n&#39; Roll Racing, and the Mario Kart series. It has appeared in many &quot;top games of all time&quot; lists and is regarded as one of the best titles in the NES library. The game was later included in Rare&#39;s 2015 Rare Replay compilation for the Xbox One.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T00:20:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce3546f1a0e8e96a71230cfa59076541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 13, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["Genesis", "NES"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Nintendo", "Rare", "Tradewest"], "esrb_rating": null}
