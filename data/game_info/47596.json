No instructions!<br/>This product includes 3 different puzzles.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Native Windows Forms interface.<br/>- The goal of each of these errative puzzle games is to set all the flags and then perform the final control activation, typically a scrollbar movement.<br/>- All the flags are hinted in a message box which is shown by pressing a certain button in a previously unknown place. In \u0428\u041f-10, they are hinted just in the main window.<br/>- Every game has a way to close itself unexpectedly - this is a gameover and you have to restart it manually.<br/>- Some controls reset your progress, but sometimes it is necessary to advance.<br/>- In the end, the game also closes itself. There is only one way to finish each puzzle.\u0428\u041f-7: \u0413\u0410\u041c\u0415\u0411\u041e\u0415 \u041f\u0415\u0420\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u0418\u0426\u0410<br/>Release: sometime around 2008<br/>Re-release: 15.07.2011 22:33<br/><br/>Clicks to solve:<br/>1 for the first window, 54 for the second, 14 for the third.\u0428\u041f-8 \u0438 \u0428\u041f-87<br/>Release: 26.07.2011 13:43<br/><br/>Clicks to solve:<br/>\u0428\u041f-8: 41<br/>\u0428\u041f-87: 9<br/><br/>\u0428\u041f-87 is available when you launch \u0428\u041f-8 with \u0428\u041f-7 already launched.\u0428\u041f-9<br/>Release: 28.07.2011 0:00 / 17.06.2011 21:31 (some kind of a time paradox)<br/><br/>Clicks to solve: ???", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T10:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3eef1a79dee1498649f530523ecf10b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 163, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xitilon"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xitilon"], "esrb_rating": null}
