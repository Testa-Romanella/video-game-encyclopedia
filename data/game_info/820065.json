Take characters and put them into rooms with one another and watch the drama unfold with their interactions. Be careful! Too much drama, and the show will get cancelled for being too inappropriate. Too little drama, and the show will get cancelled for being too boring. Try to strike a nice balance!</p>\r\nRead the Contestants\r\n<p>Every interaction contestants have with one another could have an impact on the show's drama as well as their relationship towards one another. After filming each episode, you can use your producer notes to see how contestants are feeling about one another. Are Ty and Oli about to fight?
