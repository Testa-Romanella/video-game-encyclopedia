So for my September 2016 #OneGameAMonth entry I took a shot at Godot Engine and a great Flappy Bird Tutorial. Coincidentally I was listening to Elmer Bernstein's award winning score to To Kill a Mockingbird while tinkering, and the result is Mocky Bird. Please don't try to read any deeper meaning or commentary into it - there isn't any!
