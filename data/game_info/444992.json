You have to find the right movements/path in order to reach the goal. This project is under development, but you have in this first release all the mechanics which <strong>Artefaktum</strong> uses. Controls and gameplay are easy to use, but hard to master. <br/></p>\n<p>For those who develop games under Unity, this game does not use any light, rigidbody, raycast or collider - all physics are generated by code and all levels are created procedurally.\u00a0 In game, you have more or less 20 drawcalls...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Now I need a feedback</strong>. Could you send me a private message if you are interested - or some words here? Thank you for your help. I wish you the best ++<br/></p>\n<p>@geckoo1337 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417eed1dfe1d5911872e992d7e24f4f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
