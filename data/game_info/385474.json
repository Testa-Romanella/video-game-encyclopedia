{"id": 385474, "slug": "dunk-lords", "name": "Dunk Lords", "name_original": "Dunk Lords", "description": "You might be able to ball, but can you fight? Dunk Lords is a two-on-two basketball beat 'em up featuring over-the-top special moves, devastating dunks, and game-changing equipment. Choose from 16 of the baddest ballers around, each with unique special attacks and abilities, and do battle on a variety of hazard-filled courts.<br/><br/>Gain the upper hand as you slam opponents with Slice's powerful digital blast, or trap players in grandma's jam jar as Frank the strawberry. But to keep the beatings going, you'll need to earn more special attacks through high-flying dunks or confidence-smashing rejections. Score from shot pads on the court to rack up additional bonuses such as money, extra points, and more. Mega shot pads even allow players to grow to an enormous size and dunk through the ceiling.<br/><br/>Still not powerful enough? Players can also purchase equipment that increase their abilities. Imagine lacing up shoes that let you dunk from anywhere inside the three point line, suiting up in magnetic armor that pulls loose balls your way, or slipping on spooky gloves and shooting ghostly shots that can\u2019t be blocked.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In <strong>Arcade Mode</strong>, play pickup games locally with 1-4 players.<br/><br/>In <strong>Gauntlet Mode</strong>, attempt to win four games in a row with 1-2 players in pursuit of a high score. One loss and you are done.\t<br/><br/>In <strong>Story Mode</strong>, guide talented young star Slice and his friends in their attempt to become true Dunk Lords. Play through Story Mode single player or with a friend.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T02:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72e/72e5faf37affb1e0d8f8aa6ea4e55027.jpg", "website": "https://www.storyfort.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 79, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Story Fort"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Story Fort"], "esrb_rating": null}
