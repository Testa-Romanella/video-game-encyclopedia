If a joining player intentionally becomes salt, their game will freeze. They CAN however be touched by the host to become a new salt and that works fine. (some weird desync btwn client and host where client thinks they died, but host doesnt, so they're both salt and slug...)</p>\n\n<p><strong>GGJ </strong><strong>Page</strong>:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/slugs-versus-salt-4</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Game: Jordan</p>\n<p>Good Art: Katrina</p>\n<p>Bad\u00a0Art:\u00a0Jordan</p>\n<p>Lore: Alex</p>\n<p>Morale Support: John, Warren, Yong, Nick, Kiano, Leroy, Katrina</p>\n<p>Testers: Katrina</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T03:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb8/bb82818aca893f55e3478ccf7efddc5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["18jwong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
