But gladly we have something against them: the green dudes!\r\n\t\t\t<br/>\r\n\tAnd now its your Job to defend your Base against the reds!\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis Game is a outcome of the Global Game Jam 2017 but I invested some more hours afterward into it to make sure everything works out and looks fine.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBut speaking about working fine: The Game is sooo not optimized and the Framerate can drop pretty much if you do to much ;)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI have no plans to Update this Game, thats why its free. But with the Battle Settings you can have a good amount of Fun testing different Battle Situations.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Controls are pretty easy: mouse wheel to zoom, left mouse button to spawn a soldier, right mouse button to rotate around, WASD or arrow keys to move around, -/+ to move the cam up or down - i am sure you will figure the rest out ;)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Game has no Audio because.. i had no Time? And, I am sorry, but I wont answer any Mails regarding \"how to unzip zip files\". You can use google for that, thanks!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Have Fun!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou are more then welcome to give our Toy Soldiers a small tip for their awesome job. It also helps me to create more Games for you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tor buy Footbrawl Playground, which is also cool\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p> and, thanks to Will Goldstone for the Name suggestion :)</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\tIf you wanna know more about me or my stupid little Games, just follow me on Twitter :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5af63393d7e5f687acd0dd2b89afc67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Der Kevin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
