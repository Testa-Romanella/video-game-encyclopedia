Gurk III is here and it is a lovingly-crafted game in the style of the great 8-bit RPGs of the 1980s. The crisply-pixelated icons, the painstakingly-emulated analog synth music, the hack&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;slash ethos, it&amp;#39;s all here!<br/><br/>The gameplay and interface are simple, but the world is large and the tactics run deep. Roll stats for three heroes chosen from nine character classes, then explore a world with vast wildernesses, 50+ dungeon levels, 125+ creatures and 200+ unique items, all accompanied by a soundtrack of 20 original songs, scored in 8-bit synth emulators. Why, this ain&amp;#39;t your parents&amp;#39; RPG, it&amp;#39;s your grandparents&amp;#39;!<br/><br/>&amp;quot;THERE WILL BE PIXELS&amp;quot;<br/><br/>(Note: In case you are looking, the earlier Gurks I &amp;amp; II are not available for iOS)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b94d558014c5d34a05092d174e35012.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Larva Labs"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Larva Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
