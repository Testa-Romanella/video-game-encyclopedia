Its main goal is quite clear that the player who is able to sustain the value of the People, Military, Policy and Economy in certain amount for a certain time can win while those who lose any one of them may fail. The player must choose carefully in order to balance the four elements\u2019 value. As we also hope to make the game interesting and full of cultural significance and value, we integrated the game with the traditional Chinese culture and provided 50 independent events with 10 more contextual stories base on the background of ancient Chinese world view with unrealistic backdrop. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Control Introduction:</p>\n<p>The operation is quite simple and clear that the player can click either side of the curtain to choose when an event is shown on the screen and click any place to continue to the next event. The player can go back to the main menu if the game is over. The player\u2019s choice may directly influence any of the value of the four elements including the People, the Policy, the Military and the Economy, the player can win the game after 30 rounds of playing, meaning that the game ends with WanLiTongFeng.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Team Members\uff1a</p>\n<p>Programmer\uff1aFu Yingdi(YSU)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Programmer\uff1aLiu Qianqi(BJUT)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Programmer\uff1aAIZIERJIANGAIERSILAN(BJUT)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Art Designer\uff1aMa TianCheng(BUCT)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Art Designer\uff1aZhou YueXin(BUCT)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T12:12:12", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MCATIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
