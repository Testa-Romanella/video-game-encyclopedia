Go from flammable boxes to candles and even hop out on your own for a little while, just make sure to not get put out, and watch out for those pesky sprinklers!</strong></strong></p>\n<p>This is my submission for the May 2019 #SosJam game jam that went on from the 20th of may to the 1st of June. The theme was a song title, I picked the song \u2018Burning Down The House\u2019 by Talking Heads.</p>\n<p>A point and click/ platformer where you, as a little ball of flame must go through rooms burning things to make you way to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>'Left Click' on burnable objects to latch onto them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>'Right click' to emit a force push around yourself ( you will lose health when you do this ).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Press 'Space' to detach and move freely.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>'Arrow keys/WASD' to move, space to jump.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The 'R' button with reset you to the last checkpoint.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recharge your health by avoiding water and attaching yourself to burnable objects.</strong></p>\n<p>The time spent was around 38 Hours over 8 days.
