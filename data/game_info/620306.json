But where will you put it?<br/><br/>On your body of course. Stick them together.\u00a0<br/>The more items you take, the harder it is to traverse the tower, causing you to leave important items, and backtrack when you need them again.\u00a0<br/><br/>There are 6 screens you must traverse, with ghosts and spikes sure to stop you in your tracks.<br/><br/>WASD/ARROW KEYS TO MOVE<br/>C TO JUMP<br/>E (or click the button on the top left) TO ACCESS INVENTORY<br/>PAUSE BUTTON IS ON THE TOP MIDDLE<br/><br/>Because my way of implementing camera transitions was bad, there is an emergency button below your hearts, that makes the camera shift to your player. Use this if the camera does not work.<br/><br/>Also I forgot to scale the canvas + audio doesn't work for some reason?\u00a0but I literally have no more time so RIP Top 100\u00a0xd<br/>I wasn't expecting to do good anyways.
