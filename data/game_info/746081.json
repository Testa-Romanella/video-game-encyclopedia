Then, all the enemies present in the ring will be eliminated and your score will be increased.</p>\n<p>The bar in the top left is the storage of mushrooms, but also your health. Touching an enemy will remove 1 health point/mushroom and the game ends when the bar is empty. Thus, you are more vulnerable when forming a bigger ring.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score you can (eliminating multiple enemies with one circle grants you more points than eliminating them with multiple circles).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:10:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074227ac8bc805c28d459e45f5546f7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Obelex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
