(The law also indicates how and when the presidential sash is to be worn.) Musicians, artists, poets, and writers are regularly denounced and even fined for violating the law, at least when they express views that are critical of the government. Meanwhile, Mexicans are allowed to produce and prodded to buy all kinds of merchandise stamped with these symbols, from stuffed golden eagles to green, white, and red beer koozies. These are on especially conspicuous display on September 15, when Mexico\u2019s Independence Day is celebrated and the president pronounces the ceremonial \u201ccry of independence\u201d at the capital\u2019s flag-cluttered Z\u00f3calo.</p>\n<p>Juan Caloca created\u00a0<em>High Treason</em>\u00a0in response to the government\u2019s efforts to ensure that the national symbols are only used to aggrandize the state.\u00a0<em>High Treason</em>\u00a0situates the player in a harrowing version of the National Palace, home to the offices of the president, the federal treasury, and the state archives. Navigating the palace, whose colonial facade dominates the Z\u00f3calo, the player is shuttled into a network of subterranean dungeons, which act as galleries. The palace appears as an ironic national pavilion, filled with images and objects that undermine (and in many instances deface or desecrate) Mexico\u2019s most sacred symbols\u2014or, at least, their manipulation by the government. These are visions of the country as it is or might be, not as the government would like for it to be seen.</p>\n<p><em>High Treason</em>\u00a0is published by Triple Canopy and programmed by Emilio Pel\u00e1ez, with HTML5 support from Prashast Thapan.\u00a0Visit the magazine\u2019s website to read more about <em>High Treason</em> in English or Spanish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac120c4c76171da7a4691e7053b60ee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["triplecanopy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
