Every skill, ability, talent and Titan is available to use or play right from the start. There is no pay to win, or even pay to unlock. You won't lose because the opponents had better gear or paid for better skills, you'll only lose if the opponents are better. Everyone is on an even playing field, the only differentiator is skill. Do you have what it takes to rise to the top?<br/><br/><h3>Fast Paced Gameplay</h3><br/>The gameplay and netcode is built to be fluid from the ground up, with super responsive gameplay and an amazing game feel. Take down your opponents with your perfectly timed skills, react to abilities in real time, play around complex mechanics with ground breaking speed.<br/><br/><h3>Climb the Ladder</h3><br/>Leaderboards are organized by Titan and by bracket, for example there's a leaderboard for playing Tarcza in 2v2. Leaderboards are updated in real time, and allow you to show to the world your skill by climbing to the #1 spot.<br/><br/><h3>Constant Updates</h3><br/>The frequent balance updates will take input from top players and look at raw matchup data to make informed, rapid decisions. Never will a single Titan reign dominant for an entire season. Never will an overpowered ability stick around for weeks or months. We won't get this right every time, but by moving quickly here we hope to keep things as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>In addition to balance updates, there are many planned updates, such as UI/QOL improvements, more Titans, more abilities, progression systems such as ranks (e.g. Bronze/Silver/Gold/etc), and more.<br/><br/><h3>Absolutely No RNG</h3><br/>In Ring of Titans we take the \"No RNG\" policy to an extreme. There's absolutely no RNG in anything, no crits, no random movement, no resists or uncontrollable misses. When you win, it's because you played better than your opponent, not because you got a lucky crit.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T07:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b605b5bba9a32431e316122f5b7d0b8.jpg", "website": "https://ringoftitans.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MASH"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mash"], "esrb_rating": null}
