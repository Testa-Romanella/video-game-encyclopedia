Right now you're on a planet that is mostly really dense gas. This gas has the ability to hold up masses of land to give off the effect of floating islands. You, however, are wearing a suit to make you stick to\u00a0the ground like normal. You have realized that when that planet turns to night time, the entire planet freezes killing any living Organizms including you. So you must keep running for as log as possible and try to escape the night without falling to the planets deadly core.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d44e9bd13fc545505437e650ae3cf71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redgriftjosh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
