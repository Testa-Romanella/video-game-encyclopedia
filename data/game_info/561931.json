You'll be assembling anything from pillars to gardens and even an ancient Greek temple.<h3>Assemble</h3><br/>Be it statues or pillars, they all have a beginning, middle and end. Push each part to its destination.<h3>Paint</h3><br/>Some parts need to be painted first, color them by pushing them into the paint.<h3>Plan ahead</h3><br/>There are obstacles you must push away, be careful where you move them away to though.<h3>And much more!</h3><br/><br/>You took an oath to the Greek gods. You're blessed with inhuman strength and tasked with building a temple for Zeus all by yourself. Once this task is complete, your town will flourish and outshine even the Athens. However, this is a tale of Greek tragedy, not everything will go as planned.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>60 challenging levels<br/></li><li>Infinite undos<br/></li><li>Unique mechanics not found in other Sokoban titles<br/></li><li>Optional move optimisation mode with a leaderboard system<br/></li><li>Colorblind support; Trichromatic, Dichromatic and Monochromatic options.</li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1655890/Sokobos/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T04:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5b1b4f8aef2d4c737b5bd1ac065888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Daisy Games", "Geeklink"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daisy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
