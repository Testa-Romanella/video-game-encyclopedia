Your task is to remove all tiles from the board by pairing up similar tiles.  Tile matches are only possible if a line can interconnect both tiles using no more than 3 segments (2 corners). A straight line can remove neighboring tiles that match. Wall-tiles are obstacles and part of the environment. On trickier levels, some tile images are hidden behind a \u201c?\u201d symbol and needs to be flipped and memorized for a correct match.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/7536d06c2494e1d83af3306076d17527.jpg", "website": "http://www.ensenasoft.com", "rating": 1.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 325}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["EnsenaSoft", "SAM L DENHARTOG"], "esrb_rating": null}
