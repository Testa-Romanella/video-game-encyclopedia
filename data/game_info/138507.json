This one took me 3 weeks to make.</p>\n<p>Play on the browser:\u00a0https://thekingisdead.yahwastaken.com/</p>\n<p>The game revolves around four characters/units that you control in a simple and - I hope - funny campaign to get your kingdom back.</p>\n<p>The game revolves around simple rules:</p>\n<ul><li>A king unit that cannot attack and make you lose if hit.</li><li>A soldier that can attack horizontally or\u00a0vertically.</li><li>An archer that can attack diagonally.</li><li>A Sapper that can attack diagonally and twice as far than a soldier horizontally and vertically.</li></ul>\n<p>You can produce units if you have a castle. Capturing villages increase your population limit.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing and leave a comment if you will. Any comment, good or bad, is appreciated to make my next game better !
