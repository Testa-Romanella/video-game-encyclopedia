When all items are gathered it unlocks a puzzle that is located at the central altar in the map - the player has to finish the puzzle in order to finish the game.</p><p>Note: the controls are a bit different from the tutorial page. There is no sprint option. You can jump by pressing \"Space\" and zoom camera with holding right mouse button. To interact with puzzle - use the arrow keys.</p><p>This is an early prototype just to test an idea for a game, so be ware - there are plenty of unresolved bugs and other issues. I hope you will enjoy playing it anyways and let me know what was your favorite part :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T05:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653a449a1161a768c441f76fb859e106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RAWEN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
