This MMO squad based shooter recreates the key battles of the bloodiest war of the 20th century, with hundreds of soldiers, tanks and aircraft taking part in each battle.<br/><br/>Lead your squads to victory!<h3>You are a squad leader</h3><br/><br/>Each player commands his own squad of AI-controlled soldiers in battle. If you lose a soldier, you can immediately switch to another in your squad and continue the fight.<br/><br/>Thanks to this, battles in Enlisted feel truly massive and intense, similar to the real battlefields of the Second World War!<h3>Iconic Fronts</h3><br/><br/>The battles will take you to all corners of the world! Fight on several islands across the Pacific Ocean, in the villages of Normandy, on the streets of Berlin, on the snowy fields of Moscow, in the heart of Stalingrad or even in the sands of Tunisia!<br/><br/>The game features four countries participating in the war: USA, USSR, Germany and Japan. Choose just one or all of them and build your own army to your liking from the myriad of squads with different specialties. Based on your choices, you\u2019ll end up on different battlefields, each with its own weapons, vehicles and matching uniforms.<h3>Combined arms</h3><br/><br/>Not just infantry, but also 350 of the most famous and diverse military equipment is at your disposal: tanks, armored cars, motorcycles and aircraft, both fighters and bombers, are available for your army.<br/><br/>At the same time, tankers and pilots are fully trained soldiers. Was your vehicle damaged? Leave it behind and join the fight on foot, continuing the fight as an infantry squad!<h3>Tools of war</h3><br/><br/>16 different soldier classes, each with unique perks and specialized weapons, including not only classic small arms but also heavy weapons: anti-tank guns, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, rifle grenade launchers and many more, so you can adapt to any situation and overcome every challenge.<br/><br/>These unique mechanics allow you to flank the enemy, drop your paratroopers behind enemy lines, build fortifications and gun emplacements, and use dozens of different tactics to push toward the mission objectives.<h3>Map and mission editor</h3><br/>Each player has access to developer tools to create custom missions that can be launched on the public server!<br/><br/>Hundreds of missions are already available on our dedicated portal - from detailed recreations of historical battles, to battles on the surface of the Moon in low gravity with energy weapons. You are limited only by your imagination!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T14:27:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbe06ad347caf062c4310dd7a705faba.jpg", "website": "https://enlisted.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 628, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Darkflow Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Gaijin Network"], "esrb_rating": null}
