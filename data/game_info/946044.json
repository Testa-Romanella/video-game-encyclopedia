They enjoy their time together and find each other through common interests. The next day, the player unexpectedly meets the girl again at a caf\u00e9 in the city and joins her, excited about their continued connection. The journey has just begun and can be continued in the next version of the game.<br/><br/><strong>Have fun playing </strong>the 2D/3D visual novel game.
