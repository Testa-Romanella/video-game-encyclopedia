This, the <em>Complete Edition</em>, includes 136 stunning high resolution images, which are used to skin the floor and walls of the procedurally generated maze. The three included soundtracks include over two hours of moody Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Synth tracks. Four different difficulty levels are available - 16x9, 32x18, 48x27, and 64x38. <br/><br/>Play for speed or depth of discovery, it's up to you. I recommend you at least take some time to look around while you're in game; it's a very cool place to be! <br/><br/>A Hint view is available if you find yourself hopelessly lost (Space Bar or B/Circle button). When you reach the Finish, your path is compared to the optimal solution. <br/><br/><em>Pixeo Mazeo has limited gamepad support.</em> This means that the most common gamepads (dual stick, Xbox/PlayStation-style) <em>should</em> be supported. You can control the mouse cursor and fully interact with the UI on supported controllers.\u00a0 Remapping controllers isn't currently possible. <br/><br/>Keyboard (WASD/Arrow keys) &amp; mouse will always work.<br/><br/>The <em>Complete Edition</em> includes all available expansion packs: Sunset pics/Sci-Fi soundtrack, Mountains pics/Fantasy soundtrack, Architecture pics/Synth soundtrack, and the <em>Pixeo Usereo</em> expansion, which allows you to play with your own pictures. The <em>Standard Edition</em> is available, without the additional expansion packs.<strong><br/>You are viewing the Complete Edition, which includes all currently available expansion packs!</strong><br/><br/>For maze enthusiasts (<em><strong>NERDS!</strong></em>): The maze generator I wrote for this started life as a randomized, depth-first algorithm. That was <em>way</em> too easy to solve! Throughout the development process, I have customized the original algorithm beyond recognition to ensure limited corridor lengths and introduce many more intersections. It even creates some \"rooms\" and in most cases, multiple solution paths. There is a <em>very</em> smart crawling solver algorithm in use as well.<br/><br/>Just have fun!<br/><br/>Jameseo<br/>Willow Lake Studio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f597207d6dcefd9580e01883fab5e76f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Willow Lake Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
