Try not to get killed by the creatures in the game or run out of time. Note: the alpha version is only the Training level demo. The training level is a bit ridiculous with the AI and attempting to reach the Hostage. This is somewhat by design until further AI tweaks are made.\r\n </p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>Some issues I decided to leave alone until the deadline of the game jam. Below or some of the issues I have found and that will be addressed in a later update.\r\n </p>\n<ul> <li>Hostage tends to randomly stop following even when player is still in range, lets call them timid.\r\n </li><li>Volume control in the options menu does not work <ul> <li>muting does not work properly as well\r\n </li></ul> </li><li>There is no score tracking as of yet you either win or lose\r\n </li><li>Gameover currently transitions you to the Main menu screen, if you end up there it was probably cause you die (may be fixed before reading this)\r\n </li><li>enemy is very fast and lethal\r\n </li></ul>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<ul> <li><strong>Action update - 1.0.0 - 8-27-2022</strong> <ul> <li>SFX rework\r\n </li><li>Weapons\r\n </li><li>Enemy models\r\n </li><li>Hostage Models\r\n </li><li>Additional levels\r\n </li><li>Options\r\n </li><li>Score\r\n </li></ul> </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T16:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48fc8de1f0924e93aeb9432cba0c8a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slugga Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
