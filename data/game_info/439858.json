{"id": 439858, "slug": "the-point-of-no-return", "name": "The Point of No Return", "name_original": "The Point of No Return", "description": "<p>The Point of No Return (PONT) is a 2D platform game that highlights the causes and effects of climate change factors. It is a fantastic journey through a very serious issue of our planet suffocating by our own hands. The player takes on the mantle of preventing Earth from becoming a desolate wasteland. Set in a time where that is already a reality, they must venture into the past to dismantle the institutions that advance the world\u2019s trend towards changing climate.</p>\n<p>PONT makes use of a familiar and endearing style of a character traversing through platform stages, fighting enemies on the way to defeat a final, main enemy. However, the critical idea of PONT lies in its global awareness of the player\u2019s actions. Each enemy defeated, each stage cleared, there is an emphasized effect on the state of the Earth. This touches on something that perhaps is overlooked in other mediums of climate change education. While each stage is a different factor of change, they are all linked with each other, and they all do exacerbate the positive feedback loop of the greenhouse effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85ef24186a76cfa1a65dcf8beeeb702d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["piejar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
