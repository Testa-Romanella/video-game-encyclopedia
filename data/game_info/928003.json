It's an action-packed roguelite bullet hell game, developed on\u00a0Unreal Engine 5: we're huge fans of bullet hell rogue lite games, so we decided to make one ourselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Write your ideas in the comments or join our Discord server!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>You can also wishlist on Steam if you're interested (that would immensely help us)\r\n\n\n<p>One more thing... curious to see who will be the first to beat the stage boss. Wondering if it is too difficult.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>PS: the\u00a0</em><em>savegame of this standalone demo is\u00a0not compatible with the Steam version; you can have both versions installed but the progresses will remain independent.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T19:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/3244ad7a0cd0a002217abb2f5329ace8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LunarChili"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
