The slime creature in the center must be protected.<br/></p>\n<p>To buy turrets, you'll need coins - Get these by killing enemies. When you have enough, drag a turret from the selection HUD over to where you want to place it, then release the left click button.</p>\n<p>You win once all enemies are defeated on the final wave, and lose if the slime creature's HP runs out.
