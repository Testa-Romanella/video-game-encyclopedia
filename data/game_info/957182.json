I archived this old game by Angelstorm Interactive Studios ( Angelstorm Interactive or Angelstorm Studios\u00a0for short. \u00a0). Angelstorm Studios Interactive, according to my friend, Autumn, was a small studio consisting of her friendgroup. They made RPG Maker games and published them to their website. However, things went downhill and they shut down.\u00a0About the archive..\u00a0it is pirated. I tried my best to remove the anti piracy, though. \u00a0After I downloaded the archive, the website shut down. So I couldn't archive much else, I have more archived stuff but I will likely not publish it unless if I am asked.
