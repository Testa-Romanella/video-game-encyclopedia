{"id": 585762, "slug": "a-strays-tale", "name": "A Stray's Tale", "name_original": "A Stray's Tale", "description": "<p>A dog who just lost the loved one decides to live alone waiting for a\u00a0miracle.</p>\r\n- Current and Upcoming Features -\r\n<ul><li><strong>Hunger &amp; Thirst</strong></li></ul>\n<p>You never know what you can find from the next trash bag. Maybe a big burger, maybe a chocolate donut that looks attractive but will kill you if you dare to eat. The only thing for sure is that, don't let the hunger and thirst come to zero!</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Time</strong></li></ul>\n<p>All stray pets should be sent to the shelter according to the city law, but you are not ready for it. There's someone you must wait. Therefore, you\u00a0can only walk on the city street to search for one day's\u00a0\u00a0food\u00a0during 5 - 7 a.m.\u00a0If you don't leave the city before 7 a.m., you'll be noticed by an officer and\u00a0taken to the shelter.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Danger Everywhere</strong></li></ul>\n<p>There're many dangers\u00a0in the city for the strays. Be careful not to be run over by a car, or drown in the sea, or eat grapes or chocolates.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Weather</strong></li></ul>\n<p>It might be a rainy day, which means it will be easy to get water, but easy to get cold as well. And it might be a sunny day, you don't need to be afraid of cold, but the water you need to drink\u00a0is twice as usual.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Illness</strong></li></ul>\n<p>There're many things to cause illness: walk in the rain for too long will cause cold, eat spoiled food will cause diarrhea, drink too much soda will cause\u00a0diabetes mellitus...\u00a0Some of the illness such as cold and diarrhea will only last for a period of time, while others such as\u00a0diabetes mellitus will always be with you.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Attachment (In development)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Everyone need some existence to love, or they'll just doubt what's the meaning of being alive,\u00a0even for a stray dog. Go to the bus station to wait for the one that hasn't come back, or make connections with new faces.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Npc Intimacy (In development)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Most people in the big city are busy, and don't have time to interact with a stray dog in the early morning. However, it's a world full of exceptions. Interact with npcs will increase your intimacy with them. And certain level of intimacy will unlock some special interactions to make your surviving in the city easier. For instance, a homeless can help you get food from a tall and closed trash can which you cannot reach on your own, and a school girl will put a bowl in the park so that you can drink water from it every rainy day, and even, when you're run over\u00a0by a car, if a npc with high intimacy passes by, you'll be sent to hospital in time and survive.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Puzzles (In development)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Some food are not that easy to get. Some trash cans and skips are high, and you should find a way to reach them. And when you're running out of water in the sunny day, you might want to unlock the hydrant to get endless water (The hydrant puzzle is now available in v1.1.3).</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Customize Your Dog (In development)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>You can customize your dog at the beginning of the game, and the dog you choose will effect your abilities. Some dogs can run more quickly, some can run for a longer time without exhausting, some can jump higher.</p>\r\n- Prototype -\r\n<p>This is a very early prototype, if you have any feedback you'd like to share, please feel free to leave comments below or\u00a0email me.\u00a0\u00a0All responces are appreciated, and will help me in improving the full game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T10:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/40786f205b93930d2bfe3af5567f8b60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brie Y.
