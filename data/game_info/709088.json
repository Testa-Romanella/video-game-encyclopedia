Until it came to a near standstill.<br/><br/>Corporations took control of the action and found new ways to supply the world with necessities. The Cold War became more and more a corporate struggle. Over time, one company proved particularly successful.<br/><br/><strong>Helium Electric</strong> had found a way to mine helium on the moon and convert it to electricity on Earth. Earth\u2019s future seemed assured, but at a very high price\u2026.<h3>Content</h3><br/><strong>Helium Electric</strong> is a hard strategy game in which the player finds himself alone in a Moon station and has the mission to extract helium. <br/>The goal is to achieve the highest possible helium mining rate and you are free to decide how to manage the station.<br/><br/>Depending on the amount of helium extracted, you get a daily payment to support your family and friends on Earth. <br/>If you don't, your relatives will suffer, your stress level will increase, and your mental health will decrease. <br/><br/>Once the player has reached a total helium mining amount of 25 tons, the contract with the <strong>Helium Electric</strong> corporation has been fulfilled and you can count on a position in the corporation if you perform well. <br/><br/>However, in order to achieve this goal, the player's physical and mental health must be kept in mind. You are alone in the station and no one can help you.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>The technology at your command is the latest from 1986.<br/>The game is controlled with the dashboard by either entering commands with the mouse or keyboard. Several unmanned vehicles are coordinated and you only have a certain amount of time per day before the daily dose of radioactive radiation becomes too high.<br/> <br/>There are: <br/><ul><li> 6 harvesters - Extraction of raw helium from Moon dust<br/></li><li> 1 drone - Scan helium concentration, vehicles and the station <br/></li><li> 1 recovery vehicle - Tow surface vehicles in the event of a failure<br/></li><li> 2 satellites - Scan Moon surface and vehicle movement</li></ul><br/>After a work day you have the possibility to retreat to a recovery room below the lunar surface.
