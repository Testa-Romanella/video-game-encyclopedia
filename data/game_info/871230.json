Thanks for your interest in Jotunn - Day of Judgement.<br/><br/>As the developer, I believe that transparency towards the player is the key feature for a good game and a healthy community.<br/>Since I am a solo developer, the content of the game is somewhat limited, the performance not optimal (hence the crazy system requirements) and the balancing still not perfect. Still, I did not want to mark this title as Early Access, since I found this misleading since I'm not really planning for too many Updates.<br/>Apart from that, I would appreciate every piece of feedback. Share your ideas for improvement, better balancing or anything that comes to mind.<br/><br/>As a single person, my capacitites in the fields of balancing and performance testing on multiple devices are somewhat limited. Therefore I am happy about every piece of information I can get.<br/>Since Jotunn is very short and not perfect, everyone should have the opportunity to play this game for free (should be obvious)<br/><br/>I am looking forward to making more, longer and better games in the future and I am exciting for the upcoming journey!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T04:08:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed0/ed0aab5bc8bcd4cd6313640a8810bb54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rouven Cabanis"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Rouven Cabanis"], "esrb_rating": null}
