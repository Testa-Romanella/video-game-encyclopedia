It\u00b4s easy.. If you look past those deadly traps and the short time limit.<br/>And of course Carl the rounded count that he is, will\u00a0 move slower and slide, the more coins he packs. So choose wisely because all those awful traps still wait for you on your way back.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0kind of medieval super market sweep if you will (and if you know that game show).</p>\n<p>For the controls:</p>\n<p>It\u00b4s simple WASD for movement and mouse for the view.\u00a0<br/>Space for jumping (longer down hold results in higher jumps) and<br/>Escape to pause and get back to the main menu.</p>\n<p>Secure the coins in the cart before the timer runs out .<br/>Coins that you have on you when the timer stops WILL NOT count into your score, so get them all to the cart.</p>\n<p>You can see the coins you\u00b4ve secured in the cart in the top left of the UI, the timer is in the middle and the coins\u00a0you\u00b4re carrying\u00a0are in the top right.</p>\n\n<p>You can receive one of 3 medals at the end of each level, based on the number of coins you gathered - mind you, I think getting gold is pretty hard, silver may even be hard in the second level but bronze should be doable.</p>\n<p>For time reasons there are only two levels but the second one is quite hard so that hopefully is enough.<br/>There also is an additional tutorial level but it\u00b4s not explicitly needed if you have read the above.<br/>It also has been the most buggy and least tested level - so if there are any problems there, just quit to the main menu (Escape) and start with level 1.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone bothered to read this or even downloaded and played the game, I thank you very much and would appreciate any feedback.</p>\n\n<p>If you have epilepsy you might not want to play this as there are a few flashy lights.</p>\n\n<p>All assets. materials etc. have been created by myself during the jam via Unreal, Blender and Substance, except for the following below:</p>\n<p>External Assets used:<br/></p>\n<p>1.
