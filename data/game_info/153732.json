This demo is an attempt to translate the original combination of adventure (and alien shooter/escape from a space ship) with the famous storytelling aspects of the game. The original Marathon featured a complex story about artificial intelligences in consoles on the space ship, and what happens when an AI goes bad. This demo is a much simpler version using text from the original game.</p><p>Avoid the aliens (\"Sphot\"). Find the access key on each level. Then escape by finding the exit terminal, where Leela will teleport you to the next level on the ship.</p><p>X to select action</p><p>R to restart a level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10fa70d256922191932373b1018b53c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2sman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
