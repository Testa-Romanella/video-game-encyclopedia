{"id": 889934, "slug": "moth-lake-a-horror-story", "name": "Moth Lake: A Horror Story", "name_original": "Moth Lake: A Horror Story", "description": "<strong>Synopsis:</strong><br/><br/>This is the story of Moth Lake,<br/>a small town that, behind its peaceful facade, hides a terrible secret.<br/>Only a group of teenagers, with a difficult life, will reveal what has been hidden for generations.<br/><br/>Mysterious events will intensify starting from the eve of a solar eclipse,<br/>and our young friends will start a journey into the shadow and into their own soul.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>What to expect from this game:</strong><br/>In short:<br/>\u2022 2.5D pixel art (Frame to frame animations, as if we are still in '90s)<br/>\u2022 A soundtrack that is original, suggestive, and exciting<br/>\u2022 Simple controls (Supporting touch screen, mouse, keyboard and controllers)<br/>\u2022 Unconventional puzzles (Don't worry, there's a free walkthrough if you need help!)<br/>\u2022 Stealth-action<br/>\u2022 Choices that will change the bonds between the characters as well as the spirit of the experience (Just like in life, a choice can make the difference between friendship, love, hate, life or death)<br/>\u2022 Thrills, suspense and horror (Not a survival game, but it can be creepy or scary at times)<br/>\u2022 Bad humor and strong language (They are teenagers, don't judge them)<br/>\u2022 At some point this experience might even move you to tear (I'm not crying, I just got a pixel in my eye)<br/>\u2022 6 different endings<br/><br/>In detail:<br/><br/>Moth Lake is a story-driven experience, with a lot of textual contents (more than 20k words), and hundreds of different scenes (more than 300 scenarios).<br/><br/>The script is a long journey through a mystery, through horrors and through the characters hearts.<br/>It contains dark topics and very sad stuff, but also a lot of non-sense jokes and weird conversations, so it's hard to say whether it is a horror game or not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main characters move around a 2.5D world, interacting with many hotspots and NPCs.<br/>They can pull objects and perform a set of specific actions to solve very different puzzles.<br/><br/>The artwork is a modern pixel art, with a big colour palette and a lot of frame-to-frame animations.<br/>There's a very large set of animations, including talking, walking, running, crouching, crawling, pushing, climbing, sneaking, punching, throwing... and much more.<br/><br/>Scenarios have some modern lighting/shading work, with particles effects and a constant use of parallax, to simulate a 3D environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are 6 main characters and more than 50 NPCs, with their own look and personality. You can control 7 characters through the main story and more in the additional chapters.<br/>They all move their eyes, they change facial expressions, and they have some peculiar behaviours.<br/><br/>As the story proceeds, the player has to take some choices, affecting the characters mood and sometimes even the plot.<br/><br/>Characters with a good mood are always smiling, they perform funny idle animations and they help each other.<br/>On the other hand, characters with a bad mood show an angry face, they insult their friends and they are generally edgy and selfish.<br/>The general mood can even unlock hidden scenes, and personally I would play this game multiple times just to see these little details.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can see the Mood indicators in the character selection menu, and right above, you can see the energy indicators.<br/><br/>As in survival games, the energy level goes down if a character gets attacked.<br/>The energy level must be above 0, or the game will be interrupted by the game-over screen.<br/><br/>The game-over itself is not a big deal, because there is an automatic save on each scene, but a low energy level makes it harder to progress.<br/>To restore the energy level, you need to find energy drinks, (sometimes hard to find).<br/><br/>There is an inventory where you can store energy drinks and other items to be used later on some hotspots.<br/><br/>For most of the time the player controls a character surrounded by his/her friends.<br/>Each one has some kind of skill to be used at the right moment, and sometimes even their personality will be important to solve a puzzle.<br/><br/>Some puzzles can be solved by a single character, while other must be solved using the whole squad cooperation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game contains close-ups of character faces, often appearing during conversations.<br/><br/>Watching their faces should give more rhythm to conversations, helping you growing fond of the main characters, and provide you with a deeper experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every character has a background story that will show up with flashbacks and shattered memories, emerging as part of the story and as first person perspective puzzles.<br/>Solving these puzzles is crucial for them to move on and leave the pain behind.<br/><br/>As I said, the game aims to give psychological horror vibes.<br/>So keep in mind that this game is not for everyone! Some scenes are disturbing, some scenes may give you anxiety, and some other scenes are extremely sad.<br/><br/>Characters are constantly called to face their difficult past, and to go through their scary present.<br/>They need to hide, to take terrible decisions and sometimes even to fight for their lives.<br/><br/>...But after all, your choices can lead you to the best possible ending, and if you fail, you can always try again.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T03:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/34982e647a567fe1a14fae77d34a7371.jpg", "website": "https://www.suiarts.com/games_ml.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stefano Mazzotta"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sui Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
