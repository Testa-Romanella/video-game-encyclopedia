The theme of Dying Hope is hope, hope you don't die, hope your hope doesn't run out, hope you don't have a heart attack from frights, hope you don't run into anything dangerous,\u00a0and hope you wake up fine and dandy.</p>\n<p>NOTE: I\u00a0forgot to post this in the credits section of the game, but yes a lot of the audio and soundfiles are directly from Hideo Kojima's/Konami's demo P.T as well as Silent Hill 1. P.T is what inspired me to create my hope-themed prototype in a horror manner.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e468b3f4f4bb763ad42c03d7fd28f58c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArmigerKnight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
