Explore hidden rooms, lure enemies to their doom, or simply plant a bomb right in their faces.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ultimately, try to find your other Bomberman friends who are trapped at the end of the game. Reminisce the good old Bomberman chiptune music and the joy of watching his bomb go boom.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T09:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/2698b2f6041a2951e1f04e6052c8260f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tenor Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
