The goal is to get as far as you can by dodging the obstacles that are constantly heading towards you, increasing in speed and amount. Use your 'dash' to help evade the obstacles, and collect fuel to keep your bar up. Wrap around bonus blocks with your chain to get powerups that will help you get a new highscore.<br/><br/>This game was created by a team of 4 for a university project. The theme of the brief was an arcade game that could be played using the classic joystick controls, where the theme word was 'relationship'. It was completed in around 3 and a half weeks after a lot of hard work and dedication.
