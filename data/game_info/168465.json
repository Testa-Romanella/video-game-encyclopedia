They have no consideration for the indigenous\u00a0population nor the native unique fauna that exists on these planets. The vastness of space leads to much lawlessness and unscrupulous methods to gain the coveted resources no matter the cost.\u00a0 They later sell these resources for profit. After decades of skirmishes among themselves, one mining corporation has come out on top as the victor:\u00a0<em>Dirty Depths Mineral Ventures Mining Corporation (DDMVMC Pty Ltd)</em>.</p>\n<p>You as the player must use the existing private army at your disposal to overcome alien defenses on newly discovered alien inhabited planets so that your corporation can reap the rewards by exploiting the planets resources. Let nothing stand in your way but will this all get too much for you? Will you grow tired and sick at the destruction and exploitation for financial gain?\u00a0 Where no matter the cost, profits matter more than lives or species or environment.</p>\n\n<p>For more details check out:I Will Prevail</p>\n<p>BUG FREE VERSION BEING RELEASED SOON, SEE DEV LOG!</p>\n<p>24th April 2018 - Game in development.\u00a0 6th Play Test Build</p>\n<p>Final version to be released 27th April 2018 for PC or Android</p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD </p><strong>I Will Prevail! 1.2.3.zip</strong><p>\u00a0Extract to folder and select 'exe' file to start.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>JaCaNaS Studios are 4 students who flocked together to bring you this game as their capstone final project at SAE Quantm College Brisbane, Queensland, Oz and is made up of....</p>\n<p><strong>Cameron B Clayton - Vision Holder, Animator, Project Manager, Marketing and Social Media Coordinator.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Narisa MacLeod - Project Manager, Story writer and Fungus implementation, Web Design and Social Media Coordinator.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jarrod Whittaker - Coder, Programmer and Github specialist.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sam Ludinski - Audio, SFX and music coordinator.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We used the following tools to bring you this game...</strong></p>\n<p>Unity<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics Gale\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avid ProTools</p>\n<p>Cockos Reaper</p>\n<p>Firelight Technologies FMOD\u00a0 Studios</p>\n<p>Xfer SErum</p>\n<p><strong>Our Music was sourced from:</strong></p>\n<p>http://freemusicarchive.org/</p>\n<p>and we used the following tracks...</p>\n<strong><em>Song Title\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</em></strong><strong><em>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From Album\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</em></strong><strong><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Artist</em></strong>One Night\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Bankrupt Bakery\u00a0 \u00a0Landmine\u00a0The\u00a0Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bankrupt Bakery\u00a0 \u00a0Ellipsis\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The\u00a0Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bankrupt Bakery\u00a0\u00a0When They Attacked\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bankrupt BakeryReach\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0XenojamPorkchop Express\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The\u00a0Wire\u00a0\u00a0Box\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rozkol\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\n\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58bfb68bcd2f252a135c466c8b18a736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Not Just Another Gamer!"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
