Using a 3d6, a random encounter will be chosen. Map 2 is more difficult overall than map 1, and map 3 is the most difficult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Encounters will ask you to challenge one of two stats - GUN, SPEED or BOOK. Regardless, each stat check takes a 2d6. However, Libby has a pool of\u00a0bonus rolls for each stat she can use per map. Make good use of this to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Some encounters will heal HP, and some will do nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CITY squares are different. Only one of the cities in a map has that map's single RELIC, and only one city is the map exit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find the RELIC, then find the EXIT.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Complete all 3 maps to win!</p>\n\n<p>Recommended emulators:<br/><strong>**REQUIRES V2 MODE!!**</strong><br/>Windows:<br/>M88, available from Illusion City<br/>https://illusioncity.net/nec-pc-88-series-emulators-tools-lists/<br/>Mac:<br/>Quasi88 SDL2 from source<br/>https://github.com/barbeque/quasi88-port<br/>Linux:<br/>Quasi88 SDL1 from source\u00a0<br/>https://github.com/waitingmoon/quasi88/tree/master<br/><br/>Grab a\u00a0BIOS from my own machine\u00a0here\u00a0(contents (c) NEC):<br/>http://barelyconsciousgames.com/pc8801mkiifr_bios.zip</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T04:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda262b318e258a441005a63877a121f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben \"Bent\" Ferguson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
