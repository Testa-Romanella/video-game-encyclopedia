Collect green boxes to gain both.</p><p>But the real fun starts when you hold R or the right mouse button:\u00a0</p><p>While you are holding R/RMB, you are in \"Focus Mode\", and while in that mode you can move you mouse cursor around without moving the camera, and if you click above an enemy body part (His head, torso or legs), you will shoot at them, and depending in where you shoot at, different things will happen. However, at each shot you have to wait a few seconds to enter Focus Mode again (you can see when you can use Focus Mode by looking at the eye in the player HUD: if the eye is closed or slightly open, you can't use it. If the eye is fully open, you can use it. If the eye is green and blue, it means you are already in Focus Mode)</p><p><strong>Story</strong><br/></p><p>Yeah... I didn't came up with a story.
