In Oregon Tail, you play as a mouse on a fantastical journey to slay the evil necromancer, Mortem. Although you've planned ahead, and bought sufficient supplies for the journey, unforeseen encounters continually test your supplies. Will you make it to the end?</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 43 under the theme of \"Sacrifice\". We took heavy inspiration from titles such as Oregon Trail and Undertale. We wanted a light-hearted adventure, where the theme of sacrifice comes primarily around the continual loss of supplies as you make your way towards your final destination.</p>\n<p>Design / Programming: Dylan Powell<br/>Art / Music: Hudson Thorpe-Doubble</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fe2694c04952df8fd167a0e52c5e9f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RiverGiantGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
