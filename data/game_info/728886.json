You can always hit \"r\" to instantly clear the screen and reset the rules. In the future I will likely add some detection for these cases and auto reset.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - spawn some matter</p>\n<p>LEFT/RIGHT - Change which slider is selected, see below for description of sliders (for now)</p>\n<p>UP/DOWN - Adjust selected slider</p>\n<p>R - reset, clears the screen and reset sliders to default settings</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR - pause simulation, you can still add matter and adjust sliders while its paused</p>\n<p>1 - preset 1, this is classic game of life rules,\u00a0see here for more\r\n</p>\n<p>2 - preset 2, this is the Bugs LTL ruleset,\u00a0see here for more\r\n</p>\n\n<p>DESCRIPTION OF SLIDERS</p>\n<p>Cellular Automata are really difficult to predict in their behaviors, and part of my motivation in making this toy was to see just how unpredictably they change when even slightly modifying their rules. As such, even knowing what the sliders do won't really help to inform your choices and understanding them requires some decent knowledge of cellular automata. In the near future, these sliders will have in game labels.</p>\n<p>All that being said, here's what they do:</p>\n<p>SLIDER 1 - Adjusts lower limit for cell survival</p>\n<p>SLIDER 2 - Adjusts upper limit for cell survival</p>\n<p>SLIDER 3 - Adjusts lower limit for cell reproduction</p>\n<p>SLIDER 4 - Adjusts upper limit for cell reproduction</p>\n<p>SLIDER 5 - Adjusts neighborhood size, for now capped at 5</p>\n<p>SLIDER 6 - Adjusts color mutation rate from 0 to 100 percent</p>\n\n<p>Here's some more gif's and stuff!</p>\r\nDigital Petri Dish initial release stuff", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94e3f1b01802ecd9b9cfa3ce4cec8cba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["destrovel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
