I know this game needs lots of improvements, but given the deadline of the challenge this is all I could do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is very simple: you play as the Sun, your goal is to save Earth and destroy meteorites (or \"shooting stars\", the theme of the jam) using a gun that shoots smaller shooting stars. Sounds like a terrible idea?\u00a0Yes, indeed.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<ul><li>Use W-A-S-D or arrow keys to move the player.</li><li>Use LMB to shoot at falling meteorites.</li><li>Don't let the World's health go 0.</li><li>Pickup the powerups that appear in the level.</li><li>Make the highest score you can reach.</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<ul><li>Thanks to Evan King who made the music that I used in the game</li><li>Thanks to BFXR for the sound effects<br/></li></ul>\n<p>(I apologize for bad english or bugs in the game\u00a0but I'm italian and I'm a beginner, so please don't judge me)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T03:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/5134ddc054e74b031316aa1606db129d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexxS"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
