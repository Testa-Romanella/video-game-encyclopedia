Sorry if the game is not fully polished.</p>\n<p>Currently my only ideas are :</p>\n<ul><li>making a game with a big map. You go fighting in the dungeons and you spend your cash in the hub buying upgrades</li><li>Making maybe something like archero. You have different levels and the goal is to go to the highest level. On the way you get upgrades and the monsters to hunt?</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for your attention!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00a9bb2338186e0f8e04840015c8a3b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theropoy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
