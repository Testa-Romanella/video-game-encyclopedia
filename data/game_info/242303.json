First pick your car and cars colour, then beat your opponents to the finishing line as you race through eight increasingly difficult street tracks. To help you win, you have N20 or Nitrous Oxide. This gives you a huge boost in power, but it doesn't last for ever so be sure to collect it as you race around the streets. Be warned, hitting buildings or other cars will damage your car and they're not afraid to hit you into a wall! But thankfully you can also pick up repair top ups around the track. Be careful not to wreck your car or your race is over!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a5433e4ab06f87227e8cb7117d7b58d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["freeonlinegames.com"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["FreeOnlineGames.com FZE"], "esrb_rating": null}
