The\u00a0showstoppers are in there with you and you need to survive until 7:00 AM. This game was made for halloween but i did not have\u00a0enough time to get the game to be that big at all. So im going to be updating the game so It can be as big as it possibly can! You can help too by reporting bugs so I can fix them! If you enjoy this than make sure to share it with your friends, your\u00a0relatives, peers, and even your dog! And do not be shy to give\u00a0suggestions on how to make the game better! I will also be updating this page\u00a0to show how the game is coming along!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/1823d220c7f02699625ab1a45cdb5fae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jamesfries"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
