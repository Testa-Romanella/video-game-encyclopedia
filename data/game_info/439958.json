The ones where they take a complex issue and just solve it by assimilating to a bad monster and beating the monster silly with friendship and whatnot. I hope you can have as much fun playing it as I had imagining it. ^^</p>\n\n<p>Controls are simple:</p>\n<p>-Enter/return key to confirm</p>\n<p>-BackSpace to go back (only back to skills when choosing a target)</p>\n<p>-Up/Down to move the cursor in menus</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: In the spirit of fairness, I'll precise it here but the RPG system was not developed during the Jam. It comes from one of my other projects and falls under the \"you may use any asset you own\" category.</p>\n<p>PS: I know there is no music, I regret not having the time to make some. Just listen to some magical girl music of your choosing while playing ^^'</p>\n\n<p>The City Background is a free asset by Kenney.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/010a77beae167fed745ab6407173e8d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Weakest Imp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
