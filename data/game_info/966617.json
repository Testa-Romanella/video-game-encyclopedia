Try your best to rescue all the skeletons, destroy all the loot and keep the player from levelling up before they make it to the final floor.<br/><br/>The Knight will smash vases and skellies alike to earn loot and level up. At the end of the game, all your saved skeletons are unleashed on the Knight! Hopefully you saved enough skeletons and destroyed enough loot to overcome their growing might.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Smash loot before the Knight reaches it<br/></li><li>Gather and rescue skeletons before Knight kills them<br/></li><li>Follow the Knight's action with the Knight Cam (TM)<br/></li><li>Throw down in a final battle to save the Boss</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T02:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbe/bbe8d3e936d79839f1f64540883c5254.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 28, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stepford", "andyland", "milkypossum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Stepford", "andyland", "milkypossum"], "esrb_rating": null}
