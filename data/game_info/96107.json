Still needs quite a bit of balancing.</p>\n<p>****************************************</p>\n<p>My entry for \"A Game By Its Cover 2017\". Had a late start so \u00a0this turned into a 72 hour crunch. I'm happy with the overall deliverable, but there are definitely features left out/unfinished. Due to the short dev window, this has not been play tested very much so I expect a decent number of bugs once it's out in the wild.<br/></p>\n<p>I chose the cover <strong>Gangan! Junkland Dash</strong> from the 2013 exhibit by Illustrator Zac Zedica (link: http://famicase.com/13/softs/45.html). The game's description (translated from Japanese):<br/></p>\n<em>2XXX year.\u00a0Junkland suffers from enemies.\u00a0The King of the enemy army boss and the gangs led by him occupy the junk land and it becomes a battlefield.\u00a0To get Junkland back, residents, stand up!\u00a0Modify the car, wear weapons, fight!</em>\n<p>My inspiration was a top-down driver/shooter like the arcade classic Spy Hunter, but as an endless runner.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to Mark Sparling for the music!<br/></p>\r\nControls\u00a0\r\n<p><em>currently supports keyboard and gamepad (only tested on Xbox 360 controller)</em></p>\n<strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Gamepad</strong><strong>Move</strong>Left, Right ArrowsLeft, Right D-pad<br/><strong>Boost</strong>Up ArrowUp D-pad<strong>Fire</strong>ZA<strong>Jump</strong><em> (when acquired)</em>XB<strong>Start</strong>ENTERStart<strong>Mute</strong>M<strong>Window Scale</strong>F1<strong>Delete Save File</strong>F12\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>The font spacing will sometimes just \"break\" - basically causing the characters to run together without any spacing. Makes them practically unreadable.\u00a0</li><li>The items that spawn from destroyed enemies are supposed to fly out forward, giving the player a chance to pick them up. Not sure when this stopped working, but just noticed on my last few play-throughs they stay where they are spawned. Fixed in v1.2</li><li>Pressing 'Fire' to purchase an upgrade leads to the player firing when the game loads. Though I should have logic to prevent this it clearly isn't working right.</li><li>The +3 version of the upgrades show as already owned yet they are not, preventing you from purchasing them. However the drop rate on the 'orange' parts is so rare it's unlikely anyone would be able to purchase anyway. Fixed in v1.2.1</li><li>The 5th powerup level (the stars) will say Flamethrower when you get it, but the flamethrower hasn't been coded yet, so it doesn't actually add any functionality.</li><li>The camera will \"catch up\" if the player gets ahead but not the reverse. Fixed in v1.2</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eecab909eddb4e4b767e4bd03480d82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anarbitrarymustache"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
