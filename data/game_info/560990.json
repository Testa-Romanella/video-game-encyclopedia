At the end, the player with more wins will be the winner. Each scenario offers walls and platforms to jump and weapon spawners to pick different weapons.</p>\n<p>The game is developed in C++ only using the SDL2 library for handling audio and graphics, tinyxml2 to handle XML readings and Chipmunk2D as the physics engine, that's all. Everything else will be pure manfactured C++. Scenarios were created using Tiled.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Player 1</p>\n<p>The first player will control its character with the keyboard.</p>\n<ul><li>AD for movement</li><li>W to jump</li><li>E to pick a weapon</li><li>Shift to dash</li><li>Space to shoot</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2</p>\n<p>(based on XBOX mapping)</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick for movement</li><li>Button A to jump</li><li>Button X to pick a weapon</li><li>Left Trigger to dash</li><li>Right Trigger to shoot</li></ul>\n<p>Other</p>\n<p>Other controls to know of are:</p>\n<ul><li>Escape Key and Button Back to exit the game</li><li>Key 1 and Button Y on gamepad to make the game \"fullscreen\"</li><li>Button B to go back on menus</li></ul>\n\n<p>Mechanics</p>\n<p>Each standard game will consist on 5 different scenarios aka showdowns. Both players will be placed in the scenario and they will fight to death. The players will be able to move throughout the scenarios, jump, double jump, sliding in and jumping from walls and, why not, also dash. Oh, and of course, pick and use weapons.</p>\n<p>There are a pletora of different unique weapons with their own rarity and mechanics. Those weapons will have a very limited ammo so there will be a need to change weapons quickly to not find yourself on a bad position without any way to attack your enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons</p>\n<p>Currently the game features the next weapons:</p>\n<ul><li>Ak-47, automatic rifle, uncommon. Two clips of ten bullets. 36 damage per shot.</li><li>AWP, sniper rifle, uncommon. Two clips of three bullets. 115 damage per shot.</li><li>G3SG1, sniper rifle, uncommon. Three clips of six bullets. 80 damage per shot.</li><li>Galil-AR, automatic rifle, rare. Three clips of twelve bullets. 30 damage per shot.</li><li>Mac-10, automatic submachine gun. Two clips of ten bullets. 29 damage per shot.</li><li>M4, automatic rifle, common. Two clips of ten bullets. 33 damage per shot.</li><li>Nova, shotgun, common. Three clips with three shots of four pellets each. 26 damage per pellet.</li><li>P90, automatic submachine gun. Three clips of fifteen bullets. 26 damage per shot.</li><li>Sawed-off, shotgun, uncommon. Four clips with two bullets of five pellets each. 29 damage per pellet.</li><li>The Trabuco, blunderbuss, rare. Eight shots of eight pellets each. 44 damage per pellet.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Custom game</p>\n<p>Through the Custom screen you can enable or disable three options to play the showdowns:</p>\n<ul><li>1-Hit, players have 1HP, any impact kills them.</li><li>All Random, all the weapon spawners will be random.</li><li>Matches, allows you to choose the number of matches to play between 3, 5, or 7.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Resources</p>\n<p>Almost all the graphic and sound assets of the game are from third-party creative common sources. I modified some of it but the big work is not mine.</p>\n<ul><li>Characters:\u00a0https://ipixl.itch.io/pixel-art-animated-characters-pack</li><li>Music:\u00a0https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle</li><li>Physic engine:\u00a0https://chipmunk-physics.net/</li><li>Scenarios tool:\u00a0https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled</li><li>Tileset:\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-city</li><li>UI:\u00a0https://wenrexa.itch.io/ui-different02</li><li>Weapons:\u00a0https://chiffaprodaction.itch.io/free-pack-weapons-for-your-project</li><li>XML processor:\u00a0http://leethomason.github.io/tinyxml2/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c14845bb1348593fea1c4cc2ffd3fadd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kriogenia"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
