Our goal is to hold on to the rocks to prevent our tree from flying away. We made in this project in the Godot Game Engine. This is the first jam, the first game we created with Godot and the first 2D game we created. We are quiet happy with how this project came to be. We didn't use any pre-made asset other than the wind sound.(We made all the art, animations and music ourselves)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1be7bcc32eac6a50aa85eddc871c7f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gunesustunalp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
