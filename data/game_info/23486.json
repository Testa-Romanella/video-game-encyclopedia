Then the god of discipline, having been ordered to inspire some of the human civilization, established the sanctuary and cultivated guards to defend the noble Light. The other creatures came under the influence of the old gods, who created a savage civilization, to confront the human beings. The North Goblin, taking advantage of the situation, attacked the city and looted its resources. Your responsibility is to guard the noble Light using your wisdom and strength.<br/> <br/>Leader of the barbarians and the head old god<br/> <br/> <br/>In order to make the game more in line with the background story, we have carefully considered the image of the old god, and finally, created him as this.<br/> <br/><br/>In terms of traps, we also want to add more sacred powers<br/><br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/><br/>There is no futuristic weapons and no fancy-shmancy magic powers. In this brutal world, the only power you have is the badass crossbow in your hands and the myriad traps at your disposal. Put your limited resources to good use and repel the barbaric goblin invasion.<br/><br/>There are no rules. You have just one mission: destroy them all. You can burn, slash, nail, maim, pierce, sever or shoot'em in the head. Remember, if just one foe is left alive, the future of the realm is in jeopardy.<br/><br/>When you put on your VR headset and face these savage villains on the field of battle, you will encounter unprecedented brutality and ruthlessness. Your foes might seem innocent, but when they chase you into a corner and try to bash your head in, you will surely forgo any compassion you might have left for them.
