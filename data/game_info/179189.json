The brief asked students to choose an artwork at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art and, over a week, adapt that artwork in some way into a videogame experience.</p><p>My own game ended up being more of an inspired-by than an adaptation of Anish Kapoor's <em>Untitled 2006-07</em>. I was interested in that work's exploration of edges and concepts of inside and outside, and that lead to this work. </p><p>I wrote more about what I was trying to do with it here. </p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #8 or 50.)</em><br/><br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p><p>Man model</p><p>Building models</p><p>Car model</p><p>Train model</p><p>Tree models</p><p>Invert mesh script</p><p>Convert terrain to .obj script</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c071c9bd35f40b0601e97f8bcbbeafd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
