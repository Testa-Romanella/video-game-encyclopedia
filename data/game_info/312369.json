Like in dark souls fashion, you roll, and roll and then slash some monsters. You play as the bearded king and gain experience and gold by smashing the hell out of monsters to encounter in the end of evey level some unique boss which gives you access to one special ability.    \r\n</p>\n\n<p>The clunky souls world is rich with diverse and nuanced plot twists. There is more then the red, blue and green ending. Easter eggs are included but hard to find. And well, some troll endings... </p>\n\n\n<p> Yupp, you can play it together on one screen. You can do it both with joypads or keyboard or a mix of those to. \r\nBoth player are diffrent though. </p>\n<br/><br/>\r\nGame creation   \r\n<p>This game was made in 3 weeks and is an example how you can code and create a decend action platformer with gamemaker studio without much experience or years of training. If you are interested in being an indie developer and you need some extra input, feel free to go to my youtube channel where I show how it is done for absolute beginners. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f991477afd42ee4a92d670db21ee345f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1up Indie2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
