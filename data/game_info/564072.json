If someone else puts up two fingers then you both must drink.</p>\n<p>There are over 60 unique statements that will be shuffled randomly with each new game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T07:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d461f8148fd05e7a0367edb7939b98ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Catch All"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
