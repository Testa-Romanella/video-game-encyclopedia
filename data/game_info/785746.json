It looks like you are in the brain, unlucky you, but you came prepared, you have 9 different weapons that are not definitely stolen from another popular first person shooter, so try them out! You should try going down the neck to get down to the body, so goodbye for now.</p>\n<p>Explanation for each gun:</p>\n<p>Flatline: Your average Assault Riffle, fires fast but has low damage.</p>\n<p>Mastiff: A shotgun that only works in close range, but does a lot of damage.</p>\n<p>Rampage: An LMG that fires slow, but packs a punch.</p>\n<p>Kraber: A sniper that one-shots all enemies, but watch your ammo.</p>\n<p>Wingman: A fast firing pistol.</p>\n<p>RE-45: An automatic pistol that has a high fire rate, but low damage.</p>\n<p>Softball: A grenade launcher that ... launches ... grenades ..., pretty self explanatory.</p>\n<p>Frag Grenade: A grenade that deals high damage, but has a long detonation time.</p>\n<p>Arc Star: A grenade that detonates on impact, but does only mediocre damage.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T20:13:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexJockin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
