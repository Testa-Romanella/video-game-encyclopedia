Each ingredient revolves around the five basic tastes- Bitter, Sweet, Salty, Sour, and Umami that can be used to make any kind of soup combo. While you create a variety of soups for anyone to come by and pick them up to try, gauge what each customer likes/dislikes inside each soup\u00a0through emoticon expressions. It's hard to see what preferences each customer likes at first so don't be afraid to keep creating new soups to figure out all the customer's ideal soup!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Matthew Hoover - Programmer / Designer<ul><li><em>Contact:</em> hoovergames.com</li></ul></li><li>Enzo Schlatter - 3D Modeler / Environment Designer / Particle FX / Programmer<ul><li><em>Contact:</em>\u00a0https://twitter.com/kabenzogames</li></ul></li><li>Oscar \"Wordo \"Rev.
