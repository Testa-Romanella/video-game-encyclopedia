Teemo can sprint to navigate the forest quicker as well as get away from the hunter, however, this is limited by stamina. Teemo can also hide in burrows located around the forest to hide from the hunter while simultaneously regenerating their stamina. The player loses if Teemo is caught by the hunter and the game is over, however, if Teemo collects all the crystals the player wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b1166bdc60f2ee0f021595b130f03485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sherilynne Herb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
