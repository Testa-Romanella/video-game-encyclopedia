Game feel is extremely important to me, and I\u00a0want to know if I'm on the right track, so I\u00a0decided to release a public handling test to get as much feedback as I\u00a0possibly can.<br/></p>\n<p><em>What this project is intended to be:</em> A game that is meant to pay homage to the hardcore side of the\u00a0Anti-Gravity Racing genre that basically no other game has tried to do; there have been some, but as a long-time fan of the F-Zero franchise, nothing else that has ever come out really \"gets\" what makes F-Zero stand apart from everything else. Visceral, precise, fast, and responsive gameplay are the main hallmarks that I have tried to capture in my game so far.\u00a0\u00a0Track style and design also play a huge part in this (character and world too, but that will come in the future) and are aspects I\u00a0wish to capture as well when the time comes.</p>\n<p><em>What this project is <strong>NOT\u00a0</strong>intended to be:</em> A total, 1-for-1 clone of F-Zero. I\u00a0wanted this to be my own spin on the gameplay style of F-Zero, capturing what I\u00a0feel are the most important aspects of it while still setting itself apart. I'm taking this approach because I\u00a0do intend to flesh this out into a full game that is more my own than anything else.\u00a0It is not meant to feel exactly like X or GX, and while I\u00a0know that might disappoint some hardcore fans, I\u00a0really am confident that my game is still extremely faithful to them while being different, and I\u00a0hope you will feel the same way once you try it!</p>\n<p>The way\u00a0I have been describing it to friends is a simple scale; In a scale that goes from zero (arcade oriented gameplay with \"gamey\" physics and feel) to ten (simulation oriented gameplay with realistic physics and feel) I\u00a0want my game to be at -5. I\u00a0want the game to be as arcade oriented as possible! :)</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT TECHNICAL DETAILS:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a Windows 64-Bit build of my game. It is only meant to run on Windows systems. Hardware requirements are fairly low, and can even run on most devices with just integrated graphics. HOWEVER; the game is <strong>ONLY compatible with Xinput gamepads</strong> so far; I\u00a0have not built in support for anything else. Not even much keyboard and mouse support.\u00a0This is as early as something can get, so I\u00a0haven't spent much time on QOL features like that. If you have a controller that uses another control standard, you will have to use a third party program to get it to communicate with Unreal Engine 4 properly. There are plenty out there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a basic controls menu to give an idea of how to control the machine, and it allows to to change the layout of some buttons. It's pretty barebones though, so it doesn't warn you if an input is used multiple times. So be careful!</p>\n<p>If the game starts in Windowed mode, hit F11 in order to make it go to full screen. Once in game, you can hit the \"P\" key in order to get a framerate and frametime readout from Unreal Engine 4. I\u00a0would recommend doing this if you wish to share performance details with me.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any bugs or crashes trying to run the game, you can let me know. However, I do not intend to release any fixes any time soon. It runs fine on all the computers I\u00a0have tried so far, so I\u00a0don't think you should have any issues honestly. However, if you do, I'm sorry. I'm a solo developer, and these things are difficult for me to anticipate and fix.</p>\n<p><strong>What the demo consists of:</strong></p>\n<p>A\u00a0single open map with many different strings of track to drive around on. No time limits, no laps, just experimentation! Have fun leaping between the different tracks and just driving around! I felt that this was the best way to let people get their hands on it and get a feel for the controls/handling of the machine! Throw on your favorite music to drive to and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> early.\u00a0Everything visual is placeholder. All audio is placeholder. If you encounter bugs or strange behavior, it's likely that I\u00a0know about it and it's something that's on the list to fix or improve in the future. Still share bugs, thoughts, and concerns with me though!
