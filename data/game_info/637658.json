The Plutonium cores inside the Biodome will contaminate and kill all of the plant life inside unless you collect them all up and store it into the containment bin before the life meter inside reaches 0! Watch out though, the malfunctioning Rot-bots will chase and take back any plutonium cores you try and secure unless you put them inside the containment bin first. You have been equipped with a jetpack, grapple hook and some EMP grenades to help you get the job done! Save as much life in those Biodomes as possible, We are counting on you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T03:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c59ab249b347d78a56787b884d9685ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HamzaK1"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
