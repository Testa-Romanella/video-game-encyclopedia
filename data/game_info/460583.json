Of course, you would love it if Mars had a breathable atmosphere one day.\u00a0 To that end, you will need to build colonies of your own on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn to collect the gases needed to bulk of Mars\u2019 thin atmosphere.\u00a0 While you are figuring out how to accomplish all of this, you will need to keep the food supplies flowing from Earth.\u00a0 This means engaging in earth politics, and playing one power against another.\u00a0 Maintaining the support of all your colonies will also be a challenge.\u00a0 Once a lava tube full of Martians has achieved self-sufficiency, it really does not have to listen to you.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T02:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c18571ceefc131007b442c453944066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
