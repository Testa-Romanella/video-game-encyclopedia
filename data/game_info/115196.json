{"id": 115196, "slug": "becky", "name": "Becky", "name_original": "Becky", "description": "<p>Becky is a continuation of the text based adventure \"Date Night\" and it is a game about dating strange people in a strange place in a totally not shady way. The dynamics of the relationship can changed through the player's choices and the player go back and redo decisions in case they're as wishy washy as me. Becky mixes many digital mediums like the weird (almost ok) stew my dad makes after thanksgiving. Dates are super hard to get and that's why video games exists. So sit back relax and fill the empty void in your heart for a few minutes with John, the flustered no eyed boy. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d9e3fd0c5f3d88b6838999b1b9ba0dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jammabelle"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
