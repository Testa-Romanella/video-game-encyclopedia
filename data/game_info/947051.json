Numbers are generated in the specified range (for example, with a range of 100, numbers will be generated from 0 to 100). Points are added for correct decisions. When the number of points equal to the range is reached, the player moves to the next level. The higher the level of the player, the greater the range he can choose.</p>\n<p>In the paid version of the game, you can enter your own multipliers, a cell \"in the mind\" (when multiplying large numbers, it helps a lot), a function for viewing the result has been added. Also, in the paid version of the game, upon leveling up, the player opens a knowledge card (with illustrations), which describes interesting facts from the world of mathematical science.</p>\n<p>Now other mathematical operations are under development, such as division, integral calculus, matrix multiplication, geometry, trigonometry. Email us at smart.games@gmail.com for more information.</p>\n<p>Play with pleasure</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30ff18f33c4ccc609605b2518158fae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sm2rt.games@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
