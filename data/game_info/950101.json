A good example of an inadmissible heuristic failing is using A* with Double Manhattan on the 6th level.</p><p>All edges that go into a node that is at a slime tile have a weight of 2, supposedly because the slime tiles make things move twice as slow. All edges that go into a node that is at a fire tile have a weight of 20, supposedly because going into a fire is something we should try to avoid if we can, but not to an absurd degree. (So it's like 1HP = 20 steps.)</p>\n<p>This program was written for a presentation I gave as a part of a\u00a0lab section on A* for my job as a teacher's assistant for the Game\u00a0Development course at\u00a0IU.</p>\n<p>The \"story\" of the game is that it's a standard sokoban game, but there is no player, so the box has to become sentient\u00a0and push itself to the target.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T09:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc4d8f0fa3dd180dcf2d74f247e64524.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Airtoum"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
