You must reach the indicated score within the \r\nindicated number of moves to progress through levels. White gems \r\nincrease your score multiplier, increasing the number of points you get \r\nfrom matches. Purple gems reduce your score. Yellow gems increase the \r\nnumber of moves you have to complete the level. Other gems increase your\r\n score. Of these other gems, one will be randomly chosen at the \r\nbeginning of each level (the \"best gem\") that will be worth more points.\r\n Another will be chosen (the \"worst gem\") that will be worth less.</p>License<p>Code distributed under the ISC license.
