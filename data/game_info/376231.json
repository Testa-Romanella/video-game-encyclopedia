We say different.<br/><br/>A bunch of deeply unique and deeply flawed individuals have been chosen for greatness. Heroic, noble, enlightened... Just 3 of the many words they can\u2019t spell. They will set off on an epic journey that will turn them from zeroes to almost heroes. Or dead people. More likely the latter.<br/><br/>Join these zeroes on a quest to become heroes in an ancient land. Train them to learn battle skills, magical powers and which end of a sword is the business end.<br/><br/>In Almost A Hero you\u2019ll find quests, secrets to unlock and there's lots of clicking to do. Yup, it\u2019s a clicker game. Have you nearly got what it takes to become almost a hero?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T03:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c03f7b53f857f87aaec1e2e7eee700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bee Square"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Bee Square"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
