Then relax. Flying birds will respond you disturbing them with the odd click, but this piece is very minimally interactive.</p>\n<p>This is a kind of ode to bird murmations. If you haven't\u00a0seen them before, google swallow murmation and watch a video and you'll see that I haven't nearly done it justice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We still don't know exactly how or why exactly swallows do this. It has been suggested that they simply do it for fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The background music is 'Wheel' by Visible Cloaks. You can find their bandcamp here:\u00a0https://visiblecloaks.bandcamp.com/.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfe1c4f2afc8675d55f2e7549e28c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Meirian"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
