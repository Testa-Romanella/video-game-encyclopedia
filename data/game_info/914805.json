A lot of things remain that way, but there are some things that shall be shared as they are crucial for the evolution of our civilization. <br/><br/>The easiest way to share some of these facts is through made-up stories that let real people save face, and yet still teach us the necessary lessons.<br/><br/>The first story shows us just how much a seemingly small and insignificant action can change one's life. Many times, these actions are not even in our hands or are seemingly random.<br/><br/>The details of the stories are not even as important, the lessons that we learn from them are the ones that we should remember.<br/><br/>Everyone has a story that can teach them something, so do not ignore the reality you are facing and try to think about it instead.<h3>If you are often getting offended instead of reacting rationally, avoiding this game would be a wise action.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T11:50:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/68993d385355aaf70b3dd312c69bf360.jpg", "website": "https://prox.team/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ProX"], "esrb_rating": null}
