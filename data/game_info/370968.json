{"id": 370968, "slug": "key-defence", "name": "Key Defence", "name_original": "Key Defence", "description": "<p><em>You can turn off the music or crt-effect in the optionsmenu.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Key Defence is a tower defence game. However, you can't place any towers; instead you control were the path will be. Your task is to create the path in such a way that the towers can kill all of the enemies.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li>Create a path (for the enemies) from the green key to the gold key.</li><li>Toggle keys using the keyboard or by clicking on them with the mouse.</li><li>Enemies are killed by the towers. The range of a tower is indicated by the blue squares around it.</li><li>Earn trophies by using the least amount of keys needed.</li></ul>\r\nTheme\r\n<p>The theme for the Community Game Jam was \"The Game Is A Liar\". The lie of this game was that the game is not really a stategy game (normal\u00a0tower defence), instead it's a puzzle\u00a0game.\u00a0Admittedly the connection to the theme isn't as strong as I would have liked. Regardless, I hope you enjoy the game!</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>There is no way to speed up the game during the simulation.</li><li>Keys can be toggled during the simulation (bug). This doesn't break the game, since the path is determined when you press start.</li><li>The towers aim ahead of enemies based on their direction, velocity and\u00a0the time it takes for the bullet to reach them. This can be a problem if enemies are about to change direction, mainly in level 3 (my level walkthrough show a solution in which the problem shouldn't occure).</li></ul>\n<p><em>Total development time: 45 hours</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/136f47468381c1b2a0ef4a295a2c77f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
