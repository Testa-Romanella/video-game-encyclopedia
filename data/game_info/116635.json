Learn to understand their struggles and use your knowledge to guide them.\"</p>\n<p>Our goal with this project was to make a narrative experience that focuses on people and their troubles. Though the original concept for the game was to make something grim and almost horror like the game and it's message changed as we started working on it. Now it has evolved into a beautiful, low poly experience about life and the choices we make.</p>\n<p>The project was split into two parts with two separate teams to work on each part: a cinematic that intros the game and a proof of concept for a full game. Both parts came from the same original concept but were handled as two separate projects in different engines.</p>\n<p>The game-part is the first from our education to be made in the Amazon Lumberyard Engine.\r\n We had a lot of fun getting to know the new engine and are very proud that the game is now on itch.io.</p>\n<p><strong>Cinematic Credits:</strong><br/><em>Ronja Jansen<br/>Ian van der Mijn<br/>Oscar Loch<br/>Alexander van Buggenum</em></p>\n<p><strong>Game Credits:</strong><br/>Mind Constructions Studios</p>\n<p>Team Lead/Vision Holder: <em>Jitske Habekott\u00e9\u00a0</em><br/>Producer: <em>Gijs Bazelmans</em><br/>Art Lead:<em> Jitske Habekott\u00e9\u00a0</em><br/>Design Lead: <em>Max van der Graaff &amp; Gijs Bazelmans</em><br/>Tech Lead: <em>Matthew Wildman &amp; Thomas van den Akker</em></p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong><br/><em>Arber Rama<br/>Jitske Habekott\u00e9<br/>Mariia Rukavytsia<br/>Daokai Chen<br/>Niki-Anna Sofia<br/>Robin van Grinsven</em></p>\n<p><strong>Design:</strong><br/><em>Tim Kersten<br/>Max van der Graaff<br/>Luuk Prinsen<br/>Reza Kuipers<br/>Christian Vuye<br/>Benjamin Drees<br/>Steven Hendrikse</em></p>\n<p><strong>Narrative:</strong><br/><em>Machteld Beukers<br/>Bj\u00f6rn Gillissen<br/>Lucas Noordzij<br/>Franka Staffhorst</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tech:</strong><br/><em>Thomas van den Akker<br/>Matthew Wildman<br/>Kaj Giesbers<br/>Jeroen Koevoets<br/>Max Ossadtchii</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5367e6ce1ce7b25d26ce4c0b430c15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mind Constructions Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
