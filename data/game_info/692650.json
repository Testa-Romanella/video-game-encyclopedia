Players can choose different heroes, use different skills to kill monsters, gain experience and followers. The enrolled followers can be arranged in different formations to fight with the heroes. There are red monster refresh points on the map, and some monsters will be refreshed at regular intervals. When the total number of monsters exceeds 100, the game fails. When the hero level reaches level 10 and multiples of level 10, the challenge is successful, and then the player can choose to continue the challenge or quit the game.
