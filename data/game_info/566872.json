{"id": 566872, "slug": "leaf-catch", "name": "Leaf Catch", "name_original": "Leaf Catch", "description": "<p>'a' and 'd' to move left and right, 'w' to use mushroom smart bombs<br/></p>\n<p>This is a simple autumnal game where you control a fox. Catch the falling leaves and pine cones, but avoid the spiders. You have three mushroom smart bombs which will get rid of everything on screen. Inspired by games like Activision's Kaboom.</p>\n<p>The game is still a bit buggy, and I believe I'll add an extra mushroom smartbomb for every 500 points you score in the future.<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/>music is \"Credits Music for an 8-bit RPG\" by Ben Landis.<br/>Background from Kenney https://kenney.nl<br/>Fox Sprite by HDST https://hdst.itch.io<br/>Basket by Painter06 https://pixabay.com/users/painter06-3732158/<br/>Other sounds and art were listed public domain or labeled no attribution needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90dd2d383dc345d58e5a8c0c079424dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toad64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
