He was the definition of good yet he had no tolerance to evil deeds. God made him one of his lords, gave him Castle Crimson along with the title King Crimson. His newly acquired powers were to curse anyone who abandoned the path of light thus, he cursed many sinners with the Seven Deadly Sins. He and The Moon God decided to create a game after that. That game was about purity and atonement. King Crimson would wait for the wanderer souls to finish their little journey through his castle and when their journey concludes he would ask them to make a choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a74/a749e52713928485ce451b2669474f36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LuneStellar"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
