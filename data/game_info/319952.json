The demon lord, who is slowly regaining his strength, is corrupting the mana flow of the forest, the stronger he becomes, the further the contamination spreads! In an attempt to save her forest, and the world, Kuruk Forest's guardian fairy Elu, uses the\u00a0<br/>last of her mana to summon a hero from another dimension, you are that hero! Help Elu defeat the demon lord<br/>and his minions, and restore the natural flow of mana to the world!<br/><br/>Dice and Dungeons is a rpg/board game hybrid idea that I've been tinkering with in my spare time,\u00a0<br/>at it's core, it's a simple concept, think mario party + rpg + hero collector. As you progress\u00a0<br/>through the game, you'll gain mana fragments, mana shards, and mana orbs, which you can\u00a0<br/>use to summon new heroes! Inside of dungeons, the you will take turns rolling a dice to\u00a0<br/>determine how far ahead you move, land on the right tiles to build up your mp to defeat all\u00a0<br/>the enemies on each floor!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:39:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399e42ce27d94fafcf73477d2191aeed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chaucer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
