It frequently topped the charts on Mindjolt, garnering a nice little community and about two\u00a0million plays. It was amazing to see so many people enjoy the game. However, some good things end and Flash games have been pretty much wiped from the internet despite being such a popular indie platform at one point, and along with it a lot of people's favorite games.<br/></p>\n<p>I wrote this over three months\u00a0while in college and\u00a0redid the art three times before it felt right. It was originally a match 3 where you matched colorful cages to release birds, but then I decided to try rendering some gems and was inspired to make a moody, atmospheric version of Bejeweled 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10c/10c183d6701f5b88495664f35397b805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leahsgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
