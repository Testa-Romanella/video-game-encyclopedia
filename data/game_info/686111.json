The rules were that the games had to use a selected art pack and follow a Halloween theme. The time limit was only 72 hours so it was quite a challenging project.</p>\n<p>The art pack reminded me a lot of top-down Zelda games so I used that as inspiration and tried to fit it into a Metroidvania game.</p>\n<p>I was probably too over ambitious with the project as I planned more rooms and a boss fight at the end but, I still think I did well to get together what I\u00a0have done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've linked below the other entered games in the competition.</p>\n<p>https://sirnewtz.itch.io/poor-monster\u00a0-\u00a0https://mr44matthew.itch.io/the-cowardly-knight<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b05ed56bcacf6ab87af20b4e8e091b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sam98js"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
