You will travel through the space fighting horrendous creatures, eating them, becoming larger and evolving in a new being.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be careful in your journey though, for your insatiable hunger could be your ruin. You should find a balance to reach harmony, and to face the challenges which lie ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Brief Description</strong></p>\n<p>- This is a small project for the 2-Buttons Jam 2018.</p>\n<p>- Controls are only A and S (plus A+S), even in the menus!</p><p>- High contrast colours were chosen for accessibility.</p>\n<p>- The main protagonist is a dragon that, like the classic snake, will eat enemies becoming larger and fiercer.</p>\n<p>- There will be different kinds of enemies with different sizes (Only Shrimps in this Demo).</p>\n<p>- Boss Fight (In this demo there is only an Elite Shrimp).\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Super powers unlocked through a meter bar that builds when eating the same kind of enemy (lv3+).
