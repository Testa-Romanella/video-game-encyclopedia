More interesting, weird, lethal assault guns. Just don\u2019t go shooting yourself. We just added a **flame-thrower**! Please use with great care and do not burn yourself.<br/><br/>ZOMBIES, DOZENS OF TYPES++ <br/>Zombie is a diverse race. Born from a virus, but no zombie is born equal. Some are fast. Some are strong. Some of the walking dead are just plainly annoying. Either way, they will assault you from the most unexpected corners. Recently we decided to double down and add more of the annoying zombie race :) <br/><br/>GREAT CASINO<br/>Bravo, free stuff and spins for your entertainment! Spin the lucky wheels to collect bonus items, boosts, grenades, etc. to make you stronger. By the way, it's a bit rigged, but what casino isn't rigged??? Don't be mad, have fun instead.<br/><br/>GUN TRIAL<br/>New addition. This is self-explanatory. We would love to give you the taste of the awesome guns we create. Line up your shot, pull the trigger and kill. The feature appears a bit randomly, but we love surprises.<br/><br/>A LOT MORE <br/>Maps of the zombie frontier (hospitals, subway, canals (??!!), prisons, bridges, etc.) and stuffs (gadgets, special effects, our artists are cute).<br/><br/>Pull the trigger on virus-infected zombies.
