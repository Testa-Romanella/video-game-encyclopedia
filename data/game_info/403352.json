An ambition to annihilate the rest of humanity. Teachers and students alike banded together and created great weapons, both physical, and metaphysical. Construction workers and war veterans ruthlessly trained for combat, perfecting the art of war, innovating murder. In the first week, billions were eradicated.</p>\n<p>Standing in an abandoned office building is a lone salaryman, watching his inevitable fate come closer and closer. But in the depths of his despair, he suddenly\u00a0feels a strange power coursing through his veins. He's granted a chance\u00a0to fight back. Though he realizes that even with the immense strength he has been bestowed with, he will eventually be killed like the rest. But he's beyond that at this point. All that he wants to do now, is give them hell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee2ce910a6bf52194ce8ad1cbf0cb74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam G."], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
