Solve intriguing puzzles to open doors and obtain key artefacts.\u00a0\u00a0 Have fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Moonstone is a pretty mountain village that owes his riches to a famous mine, that has recently become a source of major trouble for the inhabitants. Since part of it caved in due to a misterious explosion, the village is haunted at night by dangerous creatures that have already caused one casualty: Terence the Baker.\u00a0 With your companions you decide to help the villagers (for a handsome reward of course as nobody works for free nowadays) to get rid of said monsters. What starts as a simple \"cleaning operation\" of the mines quickly evolves into an epic drama about lost civilisations, historic guilt, race disputes and difficult choices about loyalty, justice and trust. And yes, there is also a love story or two, depending on your choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can you do in this game?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>In 7 hours of gameplay you can enjoy interesting tales, play detective and solve a hideous crime, fight deadly enemies, solve intriguing puzzles, play minigames, win/lose your money at gambling, loot chests, trade, open a bank account, open doors with picklocks.\u00a0 Make tough choices with not always foreseeable consequences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How will it end?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This depends entirely on your choices. There are three possible ends:\u00a0 <strong>happy</strong> end,\u00a0<strong> bad</strong> end\u00a0 and\u00a0 <strong>death</strong>.\u00a0 Death means \"game over\" - you won't even have the doubtful pleasure of seeing the bad end ...</p>\n\n<p>New! \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Free </strong>demo\u00a0 added!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Moonstone Deep</strong> is the first part of the \"Ryan Manolesta Trilogy\".\u00a0 Did you like the game?
