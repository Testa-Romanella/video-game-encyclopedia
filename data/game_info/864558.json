What more could you want? <br/></p>\n\n<p>This is the 8th game in the Rude Bear series (and 7th in the core Ludum Dare series). <br/></p>\n<p>Code etc. by Alex Rose @alexrosegames</p>\n<p>Art by Gaby Wilde @SurfWilde <br/></p>\n<p>Music and music system by Atmospherium @Atmospherium <br/></p>\n<p>SFX by Christopher White <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>BEST PLAYED WITH A 360 CONTROLLER. LIKE.. NOT EVEN WORTH TRYING IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE. ALSO BEST PLAYED WITH FRIENDS, LOL LIKE YOU HAVE THEM. <br/></p>\n<p>Left stick = Fly. <br/>Right stick = Slap. <br/>A = Choose option/return to menu (if game is over). <br/>B = Return to menu. <br/>On keyboard it's the same stuff but with WASD and directional keys for player 1, and for player 2 it's IJKL and the numpad 8456. Think of it a bit of a bonding Fingle-esque experience, hands over each other. <br/>Space = Forwards. <br/>Esc = Menu. <br/></p>\n<p>&lt;--- BONUS ---&gt; <br/>If you play multiplayer and let the Wizard win a round, you can play Onslaught 2 coop. Enjoy. <br/>If you use AZERTY, it's /actually supported/! <br/>The music system is very clever and by Atmospherium. It on the fly figures out the situation and changes the music to match it. So that's cool. Also, the light on the background changes to match the TV's glow. <br/>Aaaand, this is the prequel to Rude Bear Radio. <br/>We actually made 4 games this weekend, 3 of them sucked though. This one took half of Sunday and all of Monday, about 29 hours in total.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:46:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/629dec8d90b57c72d926f744ef05497c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Rose"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
