{"id": 63759, "slug": "galactic-delivery", "name": "Galactic Delivery", "name_original": "Galactic Delivery", "description": "Galactic Delivery is an ambient relaxing game. Designed for you to listen to chill music while delivering packages as an intern. In this game, you'll choose how many packages you want to deliver for the day, and as you make your deliveries you generate revenue. At the end of your internship, you'll be evaluated to see if the company will hire you on as full time. At this point, you can choose to continue playing as an employee.<br/><br/>As you visit different planets, you'll meet all sorts of different alien races. Some of them are strictly business, and sometimes they'll want to chat with you a bit. When visiting these planets, you'll have the opportunity to buy goods at current market value. As the game progresses the market value will change, giving you a chance to sell at a profit at the traveling bazaar. You'll also be able to pick up side quests. These will not be mandatory to delivery, as they aren't assigned by your company in the morning. Just a great way to make a little extra.<br/><br/>Every day during your internship, you'll unlock a new song to play on your radio. By the end of your internship, you'll have a whole album to swap through. Picking the song you like most while doing your daily deliveries.Feature Highlights<ul><li> Delivering Packages<br/></li><li> Top-down flying<br/></li><li> Unlockable songs for your radio<br/></li><li> NPC narrative<br/></li><li> Purchasing items at Planets<br/></li><li> Filling up at Fuel Stations<br/></li><li> Selling items to the Bazaar<br/></li><li> Option to continue playing after Internship</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47af2c0e2d5768ac9e628906e4b8821.jpg", "website": "http://www.WarpPath.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yak Studios", "Warp Path"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yak Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
