The story takes a different turn when the new Rover (Perseverance) gets to Mars (accurate to the dates), and instead explores Mars, eventually finding the powered down Opportunity. Perseverance then powers him up and the two begin a new adventure together.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a project completed as part of my 3D Animation class.\u00a0It was mostly an exploration of Unity's in-built <em>High-Definition Rendering Pipeline</em> that I was interested in trying out to achieve a high quality sequence.
