It\u2019s all for one single purpose: she doesn't want to go to study every day.</p>\n<p>The young necromancer had already created one jiangshi, Mao, but she was too lazy. Mao tries to do nothing and constantly follows orders in such a way that it would be better if the master didn't command anything. And instead of taking over the world, they are both loafing around for days on end!</p>\n<p>Their lazy lifestyle gets disrupted when Yuriko's parents call and promise to deprive her of pocket money if she doesn't start studying properly.
