{"id": 964138, "slug": "dream-club-0", "name": "Dream Club 0", "name_original": "Dream Club 0", "description": "<p>From Wikipedia:</p>\n<p>The player&#39;s goal of the game is to achieve a happy ending with a hostess working at the club by repeatedly visiting her there and eventually winning her heart. Visiting the club costs money which is raised by doing part-time jobs which are performed by the player simply selects one work option from among two to four, after which the result of player&#39;s work is immediately displayed and money is collected. Money is spent on club entrance, drinks purchased there for both the player and a selected hostess, and on gifts for hostesses. The majority of the game is spent at the club one-on-one with a hostess of player&#39;s choice, trying to raise her level of affection for the player by answering her questions in a favorable way, giving her desired presents, and scoring high on mini-games which include karaoke performances by the hostesses during which the player times button presses along with the music, as commonly done in music games. Player&#39;s performance over repeated visits determines whether player will achieve a happy ending with a particular hostess, or is left lonesome and unable to return to the club again due to expired membership or triggered a certain event that causes both of the player to remain as friends only rather than lovers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T18:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f8d6fb73a8b231faefd938c26aef6b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Tamsoft"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
