There's just one catch - Illusioneer is set in a fantasy world without the supernatural. Magic is no more than clever slight of hand, and monsters are costumed foes.</p><p>Illusioneer features lightning-fast combat with an innovative attack system. You have access to four different trick types that you can perform, each of which can be loaded with one of several different elements to achieve unique effects and powerful results. Mix and match on the fly to dazzle enemies with your seemingly magical abilities and dominate the battelfield!</p><p>This demo currently features the game's tutorial and first main game environment.
