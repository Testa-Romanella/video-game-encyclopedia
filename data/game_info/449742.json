The player has a bird\u2019s-eye view of the island and can freely move their view to any angle above sea-level.</p>\n\n<p>The player\u2019s objective is to balance the populations through the use of natural disasters, so that they remain stable for as long as possible. If any of the three populations exceeds a certain threshold or goes extinct, the player fails.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c049e1292aa2b685b94174f0ca0d181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Massimog"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
