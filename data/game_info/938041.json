So it is possible that the game has a few small bugs, however I managed to fix the vast majority to make it playable and enjoyable.<br/>At the time I had many ideas and there are several that due to budget and time reasons I could never finish.<br/>Thank you very much for understanding and I hope you enjoy this indie video game, created by me at the age of 19.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T05:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06aea6e7c97728f380051ac6bcfa9d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lutte"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lutte"], "esrb_rating": null}
