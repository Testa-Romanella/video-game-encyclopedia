Or the player can decide on whatever level of success they so desire.\u00a0\u00a0This is not a typical football game so you can't\u00a0 control the players directly, but you can set tactics and give your players instructions to try win matches, even on the pitch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As an indie developed game, this is one of the very few alternatives to Football Manager, and probably the only one will all playable national teams. The game is not as indepth and complex as the real Football manager series, otherwise it would be a very huge project, and this was already a big complex project,\u00a0\u00a0but it has enough features for a solid manager.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/4941bcef5bc7dd9c6854d8bc3fd26063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TattornArts"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
