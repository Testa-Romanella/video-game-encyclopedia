Our task was to create a game based on opposites, so my team and I came up with a game that works with opposite colours and opposite maps. Touching the coloured orbs swaps to the opposite version of the map. The aim of the game is to escape each room using both of the maps to solve puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lead Designer: </strong>Maxwell Jordan</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Sound Design:</strong> Colin Cupid</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Tech:</strong> Daniel Ryan</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer: </strong>Nicholas Langley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/8576fde81c3a429e6584613b6bd93ea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan - Showstopping Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
