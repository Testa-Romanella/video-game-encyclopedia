I've reduce it a lot to publish it before the deadline, but I hope the original idea can still be seen through this demo. The screen is divided in past, present and future and these times interact differently with the game world.<br/><br/><strong>Thanks\u00a0to the Extra Credits guys ! Your videos are a great source of inspiration, I hope you'll like the game.<br/><br/>--I uploaded an exe generated on Mac, it should work and it should be easier to deal with than the .zip file, I\u00a0didn't change anything in the game and code and it's pretty evident if you compare the two, I hope this it's not invalidating my\u00a0participation! :) --</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/00246a600710d1a12cf9b5dbd4adf7ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sagana"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
