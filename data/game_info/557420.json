The game mechanic of turning on a dynamo torch to see the map\u00a0is to make the basic concept of mazes a bit more challenging. It's also a creative implementation of\u00a0the game jam's ON/OFF theme.</p>\n<p>The map is pseudo-randomly generated each round, so you'll get different mazes each time you replay it.<br/></p>\n<p>Time yourself and see if you can beat your time through to level 5 (extreme). Unfortunately I got sick during the week so I was resting instead of implementing nice features like\u00a0an in-game timer. Let me know your fastest times in the comments, and any feedback about the game is appreciated too!</p>\n<p>The animated pixel graphics for the starting screen were drawn by my brother, Tristan.</p>\n<p>For context, the Nokia 3310\u00a0Jam restrictions were:</p>\n<ul><li>screen resolution must be 84\u00d748\u00a0</li><li>colours used must be a 1-bit greenish palette\u00a0#c7f0d8,\u00a0#43523d</li><li>controls 12 keyboard keys representing Nokia 3310 keypad</li><li>sound must be monophonic</li></ul>\n<p>This game is open source software, you are free to share and modify it under the terms of terms in the LICENSE file included in the downloads.
