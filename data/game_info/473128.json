This is my first time seriously making anything resembling a video game<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>This 'game' features a small little robot-wheel guy who can teleport around. That's it. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Not really much to be done in this game, just <strong>movement</strong>, <strong>jumping</strong> and <strong>simple</strong> <strong>teleportation</strong> in one level.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0or <strong>arrow keys</strong> for movement, <strong>space</strong> to jump, <strong>left mouse-click</strong> to teleport.</p>\n<p>You get <strong>2</strong> teleports max while in the air, and it resets upon hitting the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of the jam was '<strong>connections</strong>', and my main idea was to play as a little\u00a0robot who met others of his kind, build connections with them, and they would sort of join him on his journey and provide unique tools to use.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, I spent a majority of my time figuring out how to actually develop a game, including programming, figuring out the engine, designing sprites, and everything in between. Using a relatively unknown/new engine like Godot didn't help, but I am still glad I chose it and will continue learning it.</p>\n<p>It was definitely a great learning experience and hopefully more of my games will be found here in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Made using\u00a0Godot Engine.<br/></p>\n<p>Background and environment created using\u00a0Trixie's amazing Springstar Fields tileset.</p>\n<p>Character Sprite + Animations made by\u00a0Jeffery Zhan (myself) in\u00a0Aseprite.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to everyone running\u00a0GGJ Next Game Jam\u00a0and everyone participating!</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions for changes or future additions.</p>\n<p>I will most likely add some actual gameplay and sound in the future, so if you are still interested for some reason, keep updated :)</p>\n<p><strong>Finally,</strong> I will also be writing a relatively short devlog somewhere soon about my first experience with game development and all that.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfcd5e69e28afba2be3f0266ff2a6d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["b0fa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
