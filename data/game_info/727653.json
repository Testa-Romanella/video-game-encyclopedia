Except explosion.gif, which I took from game maker.</p>\n<p>Sound sources: Most of sounds I took from game maker. Some sounds where stolen from power point 2007. Laugh sound is unique. I found it when I was messing around with MIDI percussion.</p>\n<p>Used software: Obviously Game Maker 4. I've made most of the graphics using built in sprite editor, but sometimes I used MS Paint. Insane MIDI riffs were made in Anvil Studio. Also I used Audacity to tweak sounds I had.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55eca2a1e05997180710f2e54a4de3c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IvanovTV"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
