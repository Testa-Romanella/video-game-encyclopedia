This is important for a few reasons:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>All the spoken dialogue you see were Cheyenne's\u00a0actual quotes from all over the internet (group chats, private messages,\u00a0discord servers, wherever we are together basically)\r\n</li><li>Cheyenne decided to commission an artist to make emotes/designs for her twitch/discord. These were revealed in the first days of April and they are the cute pictures you see on the game.\r\n</li><li>The most interesting part of this was that one of the pictures was precisely Oliver the Overlord. Imagine how I felt when suddenly my creation came true without me even telling anyone about it! Had to include the pics in the final version!\r\n</li><li>To add to my absolutely mind-blowing experience of making this, like a week after I finished it, still without knowing its contents, Cheyenne presents another commission:</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Can you imagine my totally shocked face as I was presented with another perfect match for my story? Look at that Ban Hammer as a weapon and stuff! WTH! It was absolutely incredible the way all of these art commissions she was getting matched everything I wrote. I still can't really believe it!</li></ul>\n<p>Overall, just one of the most fun, fastest mind dumps of narrative I ever had and I'll never again be able to match the timing of all these things in such a perfect mini project. Very proud of it! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd259fd21c2f3bf427c3090f2d39cff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ziraeliss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
