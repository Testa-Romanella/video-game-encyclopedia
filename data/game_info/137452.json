You can easily adjust it as you like. It features variety of enemies, obstacles and environments to play with. In the game you take control of a small tank, chasing the great evil and trying to save the world.</p> <p> </p>The game features three game modes - campaign, versus and random game. Campaign allows you to play pre-made missions with increasing level of diffilulty, connected by history about saving the world and princesess, a lot of them!<p> <br/></p>Random game mode gives you opportunity to design every aspect of a game - starting with number of waves and boss and ending with type of weather.  <br/> <p>Versus allows you to challenge another player. For now you can challenge only an AI opponent, but I am working at multiplayer and I am going to release it soon!<br/></p>You can also customize your tank - choose chassis and turret type, weapon, color, number of healths etc. Players will be also (hopefully) given a possibility to compare their highscores online.  <br/> <p> You are going to challenge a variety of enemies. Starting with simple gunned jeeps, through tanks and missile launchers and ending with crazy mechanoid rabbits, medieval battle carriages, armed with enormous crossbows and giant drilling platforms. Tracked.</p><p>The Tanks will be released on PC, Linux (I hope) and mobile on Android and iOS(depends on popularity of the game). You will be able to blast some enemy tanks while sitting at the restaurant or traveling via airplane, well everywhere where you take your mobile phone or tablet. For now, you can play it in your browser!</p><p>Devblog: http://mambagames.blogspot.com/<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIEPYhUxdSyPWgwjAeU3sw<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mambagamesstudio<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/MambaGamesS<br/>ModDB: http://www.moddb.com/games/the-tanks<br/>IndieDB: http://www.indiedb.com/games/the-tanks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f615b14a318a7d16da4e4aabad2ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Mamba Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
