During the development, I dove deeper into the C# language learning numerous skills. I learned how to use the Rename tool to change a method name wherever that method appeared. I also learned about switch statements which are basically If statements that are used mainly for comparing 2 values. I got more practice on If statements and print statements I learned from Java coding as well. Overall this project taught me more about Unity development and I hope to further my skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bd/3bdc1e7ccaa771258e12e1db1680c9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blackthunder56"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
