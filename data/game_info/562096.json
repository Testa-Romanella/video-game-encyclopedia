Read the instruction before playing (down below). This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam #5. I only had 3 days to make the game because I joined the jam late. This is also my first Game Jam. The theme was stronger together and it may not make sense how my game relates to the theme but it makes sense to me. (Because molecules are stronger together something like that)</p>\n<p>Btw sorry about there only being 3 levels</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;INSTRUCTIONS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/></strong><br/>your goal is to get all the squares</p>\n<p>You can only collect the squares when your star is the corresponding color as the square. The star will shoot out of the box once you press space.</p>\n<p>Your star will first always go to the red molecule first, the blue molecule second, and the yellow molecule third.</p>\n<p>Once your star touches a molecule it will become that color.</p><p>Press R to restart a level</p><p>I would have added a how to play scene inside the game but it wasnt working :(</p><p>This game was made with construct 3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/333ab46ccb27d02702fdcdc6696d835c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Master Foof"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
