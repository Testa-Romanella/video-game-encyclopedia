In this multiplayer game, play as either the Cop or the Robber with different objectives for each. As the cop, try and catch up to the robber and as the robber, try to run away.<br/></p><p>The first lap of the game is to understand the map that is being played on after which the playable area begins to get blocked off from all sides. If the cop falls behind or if the robber gets ahead and passes through the boundaries of the shrinking space, the game ends! The space keeps shrinking until one player wins.</p><p>Try and get the powerups along the way with the Cop's powerup being a taser that incapacitates the enemy for 0.5 seconds and the Thief drops mines that throw the cop away. Also watch out for the spikes as each hit would reduce one of your health bars. So go on and have a great time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/959/959ef0d0dd390ec7f970bff4f3a7c414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shiv4nk4r"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
