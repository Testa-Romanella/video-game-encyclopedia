In this comedy romance story, discover all of the unknown in this world.</p>\n<p>Fuyuki Setsuna:</p>\n<p>The main protagonist of Dreamscape Highschool. Fuyuki wanders in a dark forest looking for a way out. When all hope is lost, he stumbles upon a girl around his age. Their fateful meeting changes Fuyuki's life forever. What will become of his future?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Miyako Tsukino</strong>:</p>\n<p>A bit shy, yet bold when she has a goal. She tends to cry quite a bit when she gets scared or sad. Miyako is a very nice girl that just so happens to be popular with the guys (without her realizing it).<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kazuko Kimura</strong>:</p>\n<p>An outgoing girl that always calls Fuyuki (the main protagonist) \"Space Cadet\" whenever he isn't paying attention to her or is deep in thought. She is a bit childish, but she is always dependable (more or less). She is a very fun person to be around and Fuyuki's life never gets boring with her around.</p>\n<p><strong>Setsuko Shimizu</strong>:</p>\n<p>A shy girl that is very kind and gives off a formal aura. Setsuko can make friends very easily and is a likable person. Being around her can make anyone feel calm and at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuyuko Yukimura</strong>:</p>\n<p>A mysterious girl that is soft spoken, yet hardly ever talks. She is a girl that is unpredictable (for the most part) and always tends to call Fuyuki \"Big Brother\" for some reason...you'll know why when you play her route. Fuyuko says very few words most of the time and barely changes her expression (like a Kuudere).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:28:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f82da23f9d5edddc206065e83501a6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nadare Aikami"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
