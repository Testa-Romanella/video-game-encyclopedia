It does have a simulation of inertia in the control of the ship. There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon. With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply. A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-18T15:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/839/8397d3cf6f82100ee12e017ece895627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Jaleco"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Jaleco"], "esrb_rating": null}
