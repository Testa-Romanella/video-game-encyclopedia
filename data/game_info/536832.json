The story of Howard Carter in the 20s comes back to you and you almost want to leave, but you are distracted by the temptation of treasure, so you go inside.</p>\n<p>The tomb is split up into rooms, each containing a treasure chest. It really wouldn't be a dangerous endeavor if there weren't towering\u00a0statues of eyes that stand in your way, and that will vaporize you on sight. However, there appear to be crates lying around from some older excavation, and it seems that they will block the eyes' line of sight if they are pushed in front of them. Use this to your advantage to find your way to the treasure.</p>\n<p>There are only three levels and they cycle; if I had more time, I would have made more levels, which I'll possibly do if I continue this idea.</p>\n<p>Controls: <br/>WASD to move<br/>R to restart the level</p>\n<p>Art by me; sound effects from:</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/rucisko/sounds/343741/\u00a0(cave ambience)</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/fons/sounds/62362/\u00a0(zap)</li></ul>\n<p>Upon reflection, I probably shouldn't have used a treasure chest as the thing that holds the treasure--it's probably not what the ancient Egyptians used; I didn't do too much research into this game.
