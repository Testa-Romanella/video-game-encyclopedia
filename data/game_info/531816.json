If at first you\r\ndo not succeed, rerecord and start again. Then watch your past self\r\nsolve the puzzle.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>To solve the puzzles you will need to\r\nrecord a set of actions. Press the <strong>Record </strong>button on the console to\r\nstart, you will have limited time to complete the recording. During\r\nthe recording, you will not be able to use the <strong>Record</strong>, <strong>Raise</strong>, <strong>Lower\r\n</strong>or <strong>Clear Blocks</strong> button. There are also buttons that work only during\r\nrecording.</p>\n<p>If blocks are piling up and causing\r\ntrouble with your recordings, then use the <strong>Clear Blocks</strong> button to\r\nclean up all the blocks in the level. </p>\n<p>In one of the levels, you will need to\r\njump between two locations. Use the <strong>Teleport </strong>button to jump between\r\nthe different locations.</p>\n<p>You are able to adjust the camera\r\nheight with the <strong>Raise </strong>and <strong>Lower </strong>button on the console. This is useful\r\nif you want to play the game sitting.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The only control you need is the\r\ntrigger on the hand controllers. This is used to grab the blocks. All\r\nother interactions come you touching buttons with your virtual hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>I have tested this with a Vive using\r\nthe index controllers. I have included all other VR heads sets that I\r\ncould, but I have not been able to test any of them or the different\r\ncontrollers.</p>\n<p>By default all actions can be preformed\r\nwith the triggers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde54846d2800baee7d695f73ac6b6a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skeep"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
