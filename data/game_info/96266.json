Graze rocks, bullets and enemies to recharge your cannon and thrust at breakneck speed through the deadly meteor storm to rack up an epic score! </p><p>\n<strong>r0x EP</strong> is an enhanced remake of RGCD and NoExtra's 2009 Atari STE game r0x, and was initially released at the Sundown Demoparty 2014. Developed over the course of two months by a core two-man team, <strong>r0x EP</strong> improves on the original game by introducing a wide range of Proximan renegade scum to battle, nine objective based 2-4 player vs modes and brutal zero-g cosmonaut wrestling! ;) </p><p>\r\n\tOriginally designed as an Ouya title, \r\n\t<strong>r0x EP </strong>also runs on similar spec Android devices, but you will require a controller to play. The Windows version supports keyboard controls as well as joypad.</p><p>\n<strong>r0x EP</strong> features:</p><ul>\n<li>Thrusting! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Grinding! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Two single player modes with separate high score tables, and nine local multiplayer modes! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Achievements system and player statistics! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Algorithmic level generation! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Seven track user-selectable OST composed entirely on an Amiga 1200 by demoscene musician h0ffman! \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Awesome artwork by Tikipod and Vierbit!</li>\n<li>Xbox 360 controller support!</li></ul><p>\n<strong>r0x EP is available for FREE</strong>, but if you can afford to support us by throwing us some digital loose change then we'll be incredibly grateful. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52c3b335d2f7d897080a916a4801d1a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["RGCD.DEV"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
