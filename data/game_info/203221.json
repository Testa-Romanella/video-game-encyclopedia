He taught me how it worked, and I wrote my own version based on his teachings.  (That guy, Jim Crawford, went on to write an awesome game called Frog Fractions that you should totally play!)</p><p>As far as I can tell, there are no ports of this game in existence on the internet, so I decided to make one, and pass forward not only the experience of playing, but also the open-source, fast-iteration nature of its gameplay.  I didn't have access to a cross-platform web-based terminal framework, so I decided to hack up a pseudo-terminal within JavaScript that allows me to implement the game in a way very similar to the original Apple IIe version.</p><p>I hope you enjoy it, and PLEASE be sure to save it to disk and poke around in its guts! It's easy to mod, and I would love to see what people can build off of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/496d57a9dee4a7f4980930f81df9cf49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["westquote"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
