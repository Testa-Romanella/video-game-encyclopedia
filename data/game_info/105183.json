As an artist, I've always focused on the art style and character designs more than I should in my past LD entries. But with this, I wanted to do something different, something I haven't done before. So, I made a visual novel with one image, that being the desktop background. By setting the game in a chat room (hence the \"one room\") I was severely limiting myself to having to tell an interesting story through texts. I see this entry as me challenging myself to be a better writer and to explore more ways of writing visual novels. I hope you all enjoy it!</p><p>Made with Ren'Py.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce39efa9b3d305d3e6b22e56869591e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mikomi Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
