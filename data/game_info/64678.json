Your task is to help our villain become the star of his very own game. All you must do is collect 66 vintage arcades from across the globe...sounds simple enough!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat can best be described as a mix between Super Mario Bros 3, Earthworm Jim and WarioWare, Zombie Teacher is a bizarre adventure like no other! Combining the challenge of those classics from the 90's with super precise controls allows for some brutally beautiful action platforming. Along your journey you shall jump, bounce, climb and crawl through more than 14 unique worlds ranging from INSIDE THE HUMAN BODY to an 8-BIT ADVENTURE like no other!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n66+ Stages Of hand Drawn Retro Platforming<br/>\r\n14 Unique Worlds to Visit<br/>\r\nDozens Of Classic Video Game References<br/>\r\nManipulate Time<br/>\r\nManipulate Gravity<br/>\r\nA Completely 2 Player Co-op Experience!<br/>\r\nA Completely 4 Player Co-op Experience!<br/>\r\nA No Nonsense Battle Mode<br/>\r\nA Unique Platforming Race Mode<br/>\r\nADVENTURE GAME STYLE NARRATIVE WITH MULTIPLE ENDINGS<br/>\r\nA TALKING TURTLE!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you collect the arcade machines and complete stages, you'll encounter some familiar looking faces that will undoubtedly remind you of some gaming gems from way back when!
