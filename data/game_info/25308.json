Take control of the prototype Axelay \n      ship, and utilize its wide range of advanced weaponry to battle the \n      enemy forces. Play through multiple stages of action ranging from other \n      planets to space stations, all on your way to destroying the alien \n      headquarters. Be careful not to be too distracted by the excellent \n      graphics (including great scrolling effects) or rocking music, though; \n      you\u2019re Corliss\u2019s last line of defense!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
