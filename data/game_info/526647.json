The player is given a choice of 2 types of spaceships, 2 types of ammunition, and 3 types of guns, which are selected randomly after the first death. Each ship consists of a set of subsystems: the main engine, RCS, flight computer, life support system, fire control, sensors, and so on each of which may be damaged and hardware can be a temporary failure in operation, therefore, try to avoid collisions and make repairs and restart systems at the launch base.\u00a0A spaceship can be lost in two ways: the destruction of the hull or the death of the entire crew, and if the ship is lost, the player starts over. In addition, the PC version implements procedural level generation, to start which you must go to the menu and restart the level (for accelerated start, the first level is pre-made).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Corvette:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Rotation - Mouse</li><li>Thrust - W or R.Mouse</li><li>Fire - L.Mouse</li><li>Esc - Main menu</li></ul>\n<p>Frigate:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Rotation - A and D</li><li>Thrust - W</li><li>Turret rotation - Mouse</li><li>Fire - L.Mouse</li><li>Esc - Main menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Jam</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is our contribution to GitHubs \"GameOff Jam 2020\".
