It has everything a mouse could ever need, soft grass, fresh grain, and a big beautiful sky. Please reconsider this, small one.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Door Mouse</em>, you take on the role of Nymbus, a lone mouse living under the gaze of a great, ancient tree.\u00a0Your entire life the\u00a0tree has dissuaded you from venturing past the confines of your grassy abode, warning of vague dangers that lie beyond the threshold. All\u00a0this time, Nymbus has abided- until now. Tired of the peaceful life he's grown so accustomed to, Nymbus decides to take the plunge and see what's out there.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Door Mouse\u00a0</em>was developed by my classmates and myself for our Game Production course at UCF. This took us roughly roughly 3 weeks to complete.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Project Lead and Design</strong> - Jody Mewbourn<br/><strong>Design</strong> - Alec Nicholson<br/><strong>Programming</strong> - Morgan DeMunck<br/><strong>Art</strong> - Emily Woods<br/><strong>Art</strong> - Brandon Herrera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed4ebda0e11fe6de975a9dfa1b1b85b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spazimoto"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
