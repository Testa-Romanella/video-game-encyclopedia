{"id": 215452, "slug": "fly-paper-fly", "name": "Fly Paper Fly", "name_original": "Fly Paper Fly", "description": "<p>Fly paper fly,\u00a0 is a side scrolling fighter plane game inspired by old arcade and Dos games like Asteroids(1979) and Raptor: Call of the Shadows(1994). Here a paper plane has to traverse through a forest landscape, avoid and eliminate meteor-like seeds flying out of toxic flowers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The paper plane cannot be controlled or even shoot but the player must blow away the plane and the projectiles\u00a0 by using a pair of bellows. The trick is that in trying to blow the plane away from projectiles, one may also blow the projectiles on to the plane itself. Therefore strategy is needed to plan the \u2018blows\u2019 and protect the paper plane.</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK Jam 2018 by Niku Games using Unity 3D and Blender.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981f7f259cfe26e5579f204674d1b56e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niku Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
