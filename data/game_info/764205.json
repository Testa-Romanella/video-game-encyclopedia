Leave the safe glow of normalcy behind and travel the dark. But beware, for inside that place there is something that can turn your fears into reality.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The Snare Below is\u00a0 a short game about walking and running in a dark place. Playtime is roughly 30-45 minutes.\u00a0<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I made it to learn Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline and to actually finish a little game in Unity. If you have questions about HDRP, I'd be glad to share what I've learned. The whole project was supposed to take a month, it's been about 14 of those.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The download is big, which is a combination of HDRP and loads of big ole textures. If you have bad internet and/or don't like textures then I have a special gift for you: it's called Potato Mode and is a quick attempt at mashing all of the textures in the project into muddy pixelated versions of their former selves. It's kinda cool, but hopefully not too insulting to the original artists.<br/>\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54\ud83e\udd54</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T04:40:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd80aa3f455859b969947fca71f69d50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevZach"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
