In the game, the fruit will move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Please use the mouse to control the release time of the weapon and destroy the fruit. If you fail to hit the fruit, you will fail to enter the level. The more fruit you eliminate, the more gold you will harvest. Gold coins can be used in the twist lottery, whether it's a CG or a weapon prop, who knows? A beautiful CG may be your most desired gift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T03:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742b4445ab0c63bf114d7d8a3291a12b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MG Works"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["MG Works"], "esrb_rating": null}
