Can you save her in time?</p>\n\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>50 years ago, the evil magician known as Malice appeared and within days blighted the land and corrupted it's people. Seeking greater power, he discovered the half-genie known as Shera who's power was pure and sent his 40 Thieves to steal her away so to absorb her power. Shera's son, Sarzha, is the only one left who is unaffected by Malice's blight. Armed with only a ring that staves off death, Sarzha marches into Malice's stronghold alone to save his mother - but time is not on his side. Malice's ritual to absorb Shera is nearly complete, and unless Sarzha can reach her in time she will be lost - and Malice will rule the land, forever.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Shera &amp; the 40 Thieves features 2+ modes of gameplay, including\u00a0Normal and Difficult modes, with more difficult modes to discover for skilled players, with 100+ screens to experience and master.<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>D-Pad: Move player<br/>D-Pad UP: Climb ladder<br/>A Button: Jump<br/>B Button: Activate Text (when prompted)<br/>Select: Change Selection<br/>Start: Pause/Start game</p><p>Emulator Keyboard Keys (can be remapped)</p><p>WASD:\u00a0Move Player<br/>W key: Climb Ladder<br/>L key: Jump<br/>K key: Activate Text (when prompted)<br/>G key: Change Selection<br/>H key:\u00a0Pause/Start game<br/>ESC: Emulator Options</p><p>Soundtrack is available on most music platforms:</p><p>Spotify:\u00a0https://sptfy.com/egLq</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Game created by CrazyGroupTrio games, with assistance from the NESmaker Community.
