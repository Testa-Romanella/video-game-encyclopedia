{"id": 289768, "slug": "drift-stage-special-expo-version", "name": "Drift Stage [Special Expo Version]", "name_original": "Drift Stage [Special Expo Version]", "description": "<strong>\n<p>Due to the continued popularity of 'Drift Stage' Pre-Alpha v0.1.1 prototype, Super Systems has organized a public release of \u2018Drift Stage Pre-Alpha v0.1.2\u2019. </p>\n<p>Designated \u2018Drift Stage:\u00a0 Expo Edition\u2019; this unreleased variation of the extremely\u00a0 popular \u2018Drift Stage 0.1.1 Pre-alpha Demo\u2019 was quickly prepared for use at various events and expos. With a focus on fast competitive play, this streamlined and polished build never saw wide-spread use due to minor bugs and development oriented features such as 'cinematic camera' controls used in making the games first promotional videos. \r\nUnique to this version, a \u2018rolling start\u2019 intro leads into a three lap time attack, pitting you against rival ghost cars on the twisty sunset swept overpasses of Eventide Highway. However; You\u2019re behind the wheel of the mighty \u2018Tedesco\u2019 super car this time. You\u2019ll remember it as the\u00a0 \u2018Advanced\u2019 ghost car you\u2019ve been chasing since 2015.</p>\n<p>A full attract mode to finish game-play loop is present, unlike 0.1.1, which had an endless lap counter. This change was made specifically for arcade cabinet setups and demoing at events. Beyond the aesthetic and mechanical changes, this version features refined lap timing and ghost car recording. \r\nThe changes to the code result in more accurate reproduction of your previous personal best times. The trade-off being more jumpy looking ghost car graphics; but with more accurate speed, position and throttle data compared to the smooth and eye-pleasing iteration in v0.1.1.</p>\n<p>The initial response of Drift Stage by fans and supporters go beyond any of the original teams expectations. We hope you enjoy this small part of Drift Stage\u2019s history. During a games development, prototype &amp; experimental builds tend to be discarded after new versions are completed. In an effort to preserve as much of Drift Stage\u2019s alpha and beta content, we are encouraging fans to archive and share this free prototype with their friends. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 <em> - Super Systems Softworks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits &amp; Contacts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>www.driftstagegame.com<br/><br/></p></strong><ul><strong><li>Chase Pettit (Programmer)</li><li>DelkoDuck (Art) </li><li>Hugh Myrone (Music) -\u00a0Bandcamp<br/></li></strong><li><strong>Akemi Look (Voice)</strong></li></ul>\n\n<strong>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This version of Drift Stage was not originally developed for a public release; Users may encounter bugs due to specific system compatibility conflicts due to newer hardware or operating systems. </em><br/></p>\n<br/><br/></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/566425a15bdebc299f9c67c722865cad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Super Systems"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
