With practice, you'll be able to jump, but explore with care; a single missed jump could lead to a long fall back down.<br/><br/>In this game you will jump from platform to platform to get as high as possible, in a constant challenge not to fall and start all over again from the beginning.<br/><br/>The gameplay is clear and simple. You control a character where you can walk left or right and you need to jump over the platforms to try to climb as much as you can.<br/>Do you accept the challenge?<br/><br/>Between 20 minutes with speedrun or hours of agonizing gameplay, depending.
