It's the second time I'm using Godot for making a game, the first time for a 3D game.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to push the limits of the engine graphics options and see how it looks good.</p>\n<p>I mainly made this game to get used to Godot and its 3D tools, which are really great!</p>\n<p>I also wanted to make a narrative game with minimal gameplay. I finished with no gameplay at all.</p><p>The game has 2 scenes and you get stuck on the beginning of the second with nothing to do other than appreciating the nice and smooth graphics of the car seat. I wanted to send the cacti out in space, but I kinda ran out of time. I didn't want to find a neat name since it's in an unfinished state.<br/></p>\n<p>I'll link all the source code of the project.</p>\n<p>Every piece of the game has been made by me, except the traffic noise which is under license CC0 by Marcel Gnauk (https://opengameart.org/content/american-interstates-from-iowa-to-california-sou...) and the car park HDRI wich is under license CC0 (https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?c=urban&amp;h=skylit_garage)<br/></p>\n<p>I used Blender for the 3D models and HDRIs, Gimp 2.10 for the textures and my phone for the voice acting.<br/></p><p>My game and all of its content are under CC0 license.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60cfa1186b31c736037a000e8591f6c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["crazyrems"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
