{"id": 21330, "slug": "motorhead", "name": "Motorhead", "name_original": "Motorhead", "description": "The future of racing is here, and it's called MOTORHEAD. This game allows you to hop in one of 10 streamlined racers and test your skills on eight obstacle-filled courses that wind through urban, desert, and seaside terrain. Play modes include the standard Time Attack, Single Race, League, and Head-to-Head competition found in any decent racing game. One unique feature of MOTORHEAD is that you can choose between 30 or 60 frames per second. Choosing 60fps gives the game a polished look, but you're limited to a three-car field. While going with 30fps hurts in the visual department, it does expand the field to seven cars; you'll probably want to experiment with both to figure out which one works best for you.. This futuristic racer has impressive visuals and cleverly designed vehicles that help put you in a futuristic state of mind. So if you're in the mood for a fast and fun racing experience, get your hands on MOTORHEAD.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f951d63257391ef7fc82e14f24f61c.jpg", "website": "http://consoleclassics.co/?games=motorhead", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Urbanscan"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Console Classics"], "esrb_rating": null}
