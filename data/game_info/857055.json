This story will be more accurate version from Antonio's native script than my own version (previously developed as PROJECT: LOVE + CAFE). The game's language will be native as Filipino only, yet the English language is not available. The first gameplay test title is \"Cancerous Kang Carrot Ka\".</p>\n<p>Unlike my own version, most of the cartoony/popular culture references were longer involved and converts into more theater-style approach as well as more features will added include Visual Novel-style menu button system, Picture Thumbnail Save/Load System, and Backlog System.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Semi-kinetic novel is only focusing on nonlinear plot with different main characters as the player does not interact with the story such as branching choices and multiple endings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b318a87f34f11121ff10cecc58fc04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Moonwriter's Tale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
