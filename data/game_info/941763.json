The planet houses a secret that none of its inhabitants are aware of...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Captain Disaster and The Two Worlds of Riskara</strong>\u00a0features a contextual one-click interface, a host of colourful characters, devious puzzles, detailed cartoon style graphics, full voicing and an original soundtrack. You play as the adventurous but not altogether bright eponymous Captain, aided (sometimes) by your ship's computer, Zero-Bit, as you help a race of aliens whose complex history is largely unknown, even to themselves.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is a collaboration between award-winning developers\u00a0<strong><em>Dave Seaman</em></strong>\u00a0(multiple\u00a0<em>AGS Awards</em>\u00a0for\u00a0<strong>Captain Disaster in: Death Has A Million Stomping Boots</strong>\u00a0&amp; other games) and\u00a0<em><strong>Lorenzo Boni</strong></em>\u00a0(winner of the\u00a0<em>$106 Adventure Game Challenge</em>\u00a0for\u00a0<strong>Where Did the Humans Go?</strong>\u00a0and an\u00a0<em>AGS Award</em>). These two amiable lunatics have been point &amp; click adventure game fans for many years and they have collaborated previously on small games and even a children's book, but nothing approaching the scale and scope of this new Captain Disaster game!<br/><br/>(Playing the two previous Captain Disaster games is not necessary for this one, although there will be some references to events in the earlier games, and even a returning character from Stomping Boots...)<br/><br/>The soundtrack is being composed by\u00a0<em><strong>Eric Galluzzo</strong></em>, a recent finalist in the\u00a0<em>Ryan Leach Composition Competition</em>, whose previous work includes the OST for\u00a0<strong>The Corruption Within</strong>.<br/><br/><br/>Making this game together has been a real joy and we hope that comes across in the game, and we sincerely hope you have as much fun playing it as we are having making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/1912a29aba6e34c1b978d7876a430134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainD", "Lorenzo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
