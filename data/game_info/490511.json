It is a full standalone game not requiring Discrepant to play. It fills in an important story line to the original game but is set completely in space, and follows in the spirit and tradition of classic space sci-fi horror games. It is free to play as a playful side quest to the original story in the spirit of space horrors like Alien: Isolation and Dead Space.<br/><br/>\"The sound of a ship exiting hyperspace was impossible to hear in the vacuum of space, of course, but the visual effect was dramatic and breathtaking.
