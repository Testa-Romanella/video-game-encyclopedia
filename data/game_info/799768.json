The sounds of people can be heard passing by, sometimes knocking on the wall. But nobody stays long enough to hear Aiden through the wall. Until a stranger finds a way to talk with him: notes shoved back and forth through a vent.<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Behind a Wall</em> is my FMV (full motion video) game that explores the feelings of loneliness and the struggle to truly connect with other human beings that is inherent in the nature of communication. This is my Spring 2022 undergraduate thesis project under the facilitation of professor Ben Bays in the Radio-Television-Film program\u00a0at the University of Texas.<br/></p>\n<p>The semester has ended, but this game will still be in active development. I know I can make this better. After a break and a lot of sleep, I'll come back.</p>\n<p>More info and content will be added to this page as things progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40c104338824652db44134c4f3e50de3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBestTomo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
