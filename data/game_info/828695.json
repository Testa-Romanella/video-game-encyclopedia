Collect points to upgrade gear and discover strange creatures.</p>\n<p>This game is dedicated to my friend Michelle who reintroduced me to cow evolution and who inspired the toilet theme :) <br/></p>\n<p>Sorry for the ugly user interface, that has always been a struggle for me.<br/></p>\n<p>I am a highly inexperienced developer so any feedback is appreciated. I want to make sure that the game feels as smooth as possible to play, however nobody but myself has play-tested it. So if any of the mechanics feel intuitive please let me know!</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to exit by holding the escape key. Otherwise the game won't save :P</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is also my first time implementing a save system to a game, so if you experience any hiccups relating to save files getting deleted or corrupted, let me know so I can both fix the issue and help recover any lost progress.<br/></p>\n<p>Please contact me if you encounter any crashes or bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Smoke Gif: <br/>Jason Clarke<br/>Various Audio:<br/>kevinkace<br/>DSISStudios<br/>InspectorJ<br/>flag2<br/>kiddpark<br/>pauliperez1999<br/>adh.dreaming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97b/97bfb1e4ddb443118a14969ab10e6e6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["namfo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
