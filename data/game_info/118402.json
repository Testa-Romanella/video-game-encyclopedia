Roll across 3 stages to get her back!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Unity 3D,\u00a0GIMP, and maya 2017.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Jam Theme:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The jams theme was dual purpose giving objects and mechanics multiple purposes aka doing a lot with a little. \u00a0The game fits the theme in many ways, when you control your character Ball kid, you tilt the screen, which also tilts and moves some of the enemies and traps. Each new stage introduces 4 new objects (Besides the last stage) and each object has more than one purpose. The last stage reuses both stages objects to mix them together.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Assets used:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Rim-light character shader:</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/82457</p>\n<p>Mogura Music:</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/22641</p>\n<p>Game Jam Menu\u00a0Asset:</p>\n<p>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/40465<br/></p>\n<p>Pixel\u00a0Font:</p>\n<p>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?#!/content/64734<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A gamejam game made by Fredrick Conception./Conception Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61caafa356ed836ef86eb77fc2c6b48b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Conception Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
