Now it's more of a small and unpolished little experiment\u00a0rather than a game, but I hope you enjoy trying it nevertheless.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Run: Hold LShift</p>\n<p>Look: Mouse</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Toggle fullscreen: F</p>\n<p>Detach/attach cursor: M</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game, game engine, programming, art assets by Jere Koivisto</p>\n<p>SDL2 https://www.libsdl.org/</p>\n<p>GLEW http://glew.sourceforge.net/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T17:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/62007d26bedaae2a895b9f1c9a4270c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Romma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
