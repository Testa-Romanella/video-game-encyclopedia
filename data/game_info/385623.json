Tiny little pixel graphics and zappy retro sound effects. <br/><br/>This game pays homage to the classic maze game genre that took arcades by storm in the early 1980s. Each stage challenges you to navigate a maze and collect all of the flowers laying around. Once you do, a locked door will appear. Pick up the key and bring it to the door to move on to the next level, where things get a little harder. It seems easy, but a wide range of creatures inhabit these mazes, each with minds of their own. <br/><br/>Some of them like to steal the key. Others just like to fight. Some will steal the flowers for themselves. They'll get in your way, but they'll also sometimes clash with each other. You'll have to learn how to predict what they'll do if you want to go far. You're far from defenseless yourself. You can dispatch other creatures by shooting at them, or take them down by mastering the special charge attack. Just be careful you don't shoot yourself in the back!<br/><br/>Forget-Me-Not features lots of different modes of play so that there's always a new challenge to tackle. See how many points you can earn in the Standard mode, mix up the difficulty in Shuffle mode, tackle special daily mazes in Seed mode, last as long as you can in Survival mode, or take on the never-ending waves of foes in Arena mode. Best of all, you can play any of these modes together with a friend on one device! Your best scores in each mode will be recorded, giving you something to shoot for each time you play. Forget-Me-Not is an unforgettable arcade game with plenty of strategy!<br/><br/>- Classic Style: Navigate the mazes and pick up all of the flowers!<br/>- Simple Controls: Just swipe in any direction to move and turn! <br/>- Intense Strategy: Every creature has a mind of its own, so make your moves carefully!<br/>- Deep Scoring System: You'll need to master lots of techniques to rack up the points!<br/>- Grind and Charge: Lean into the walls of the maze to charge up a powerful attack!<br/>- Tons of Modes: Five different modes and multiple levels of difficulty keep things fresh!<br/>- Play with a Friend: You can play any of the modes on one device with a friend! Will you help or hinder each other?<br/><br/>**************************************************<br/><br/>Forget-Me-Not is playable for free, with some sections and features available only to subscribers of GameClub Pro, an optional auto-renewing monthly subscription which also removes ads.
