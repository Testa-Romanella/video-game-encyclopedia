You have to click the One Button as fast as possible in a variable time limit, but the One Button bounces and dodges around the screen. Accuracy is key. Missed clicks lose you points while successful ones gain you points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made as a personal challenge to discover how far polish and graphics can make a simple game go. This is my game also released on mobile (android)\u00a0so it's not very ambitious. Hope you guys enjoy!
