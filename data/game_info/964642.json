But her daily mundane \"life\" of a monotonous cycle is interrupted by Slimes, Boss fights, Giant Crabs and more! (Not too much more because the game is short (Sorry ;A;))<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/><ul><li>A cool game made in an unusual independently made game engine \"RPG Paper Maker\"!<br/></li><li>A short story you can get through pretty quick... (It's a feature because it doesn't waste your time?)<br/></li><li>A Soundtrack written and junk by NeatNeet!<br/></li><li>A cat!<br/></li><li>A hint system on the pause menu in case you get lost!<br/></li><li>Guest Artwork by some cool people!</li></ul><br/><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/><strong>WASD</strong> to move.<br/><br/><strong>Enter/Return</strong> to interact.<br/><br/><strong>X/Esc</strong> to cancel.<br/><br/><strong>Enter+Shift</strong> to toggle Fullscreen.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong><br/>RPG Paper Maker is an engine that is still being worked on so some \"standard\" features might not exist yet.
