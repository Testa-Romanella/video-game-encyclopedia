{"id": 137651, "slug": "elementball", "name": "Elementball", "name_original": "Elementball", "description": "<p>This is my first 'released' Unity3d project. It is a Frankenstein's monster of tutorials (namely Unity3d's own Roll-A-Ball and Survival Shooter), code snippets, and 'that'll do'. \u00a0I just wanted to release a finished prototype, I did not mess with resolutions or anything, so if it doesn't work on your machine I'm sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>The game: </strong>WASD to move, click on the elemental force button to attack. You collect the yellow cubes which give you power and some health. You collect elemental powers from the summoning spheres of that particular element. You are able to execute an elemental area-of-effect \u00a0attack, affecting only the opposing element. Fire beats forest, forest beats water, water beats fire.\u00a0\u00a0Grey enemies can be attacked with no elemental force, but the 'mana' cost is the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you have full mana and an elemental force, you can destroy the 'altar' of the opposing element by entering it with the elementball. When destroyed, they turn into respawning 'pure' altars, which give you health and mana. You win when all the altars are destroyed.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong>\u00a0The music ('Wolf\u00a0Blood') is by Adrian Von\u00a0Ziegler (@AdrianVZiegler), a Swiss composer that makes some beautiful music in a variety of styles; Particle effects are by Alessandro Salvati (@NeatWolf) and his work is available on the asset store (This is the pack I used:\u00a0https://www.assetstore.unity3d...).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec8/ec881d4b7ac9b1aff05317b6181916af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scott Chauss\u00e9e"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
