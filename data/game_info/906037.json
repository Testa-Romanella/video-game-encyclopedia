{"id": 906037, "slug": "kinda-fun", "name": "KINDA FUN", "name_original": "KINDA FUN", "description": "<p>Created for #LDJAM52! :D</p><p>This  was pretty tricky. I couldn\u2019t come up with a great idea so I just  free-styled what I could off of the prompt. It turns out the prompt was  only loosely associated with what I actually came up with. In fact, the  idea of \u201charvest\u201d-style gameplay in itself was kind of hard to associate  with the game. So, I took the basic principle (harvesting a resource)  and tried to expand it out to cover an entire gameplay experience  without actually bothering to draw a vegetable or something that can  actually be harvested. I hope you enjoy the loose application of the  definition of the word \u201charvest\u201d, and by \u201cloose application\u201d I mean a  blatant disregard for anything about what that means, and only really  involving with the basic principle that the harvesting part is probably  the good part of the game. That is, the part where you get a big WOOSH  and the points go up. Or you earn/unlock something useful, or you  progress somehow. You definitely progress somehow in this game using the  harvest button, but I\u2019m not sure it really makes sense with the meaning  of the word \u201charvest\u201d. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t really matter. The game takes  5 minutes to complete. Don\u2019t harvest too early or you will interrupt  these poor guys just trying to build a game here. It\u2019s not much, but for  them, it\u2019s honest work. I hope you enjoy.\r\n</p>\n<p>EDIT: You should also  note that if you click \u201charvest\u201d too early they will fuck up the game.  That\u2019s not my fault, I tried to stop it. But I mean, I can\u2019t be  responsible for everything in the game. The player has a degree of  choice. That\u2019s why God gave us free will: To allow us the possibility of  failure to apply His will. So anyway, don\u2019t click on the harvest button  or it will interrupt the guy trying to build the game. However at some  point you are going to have to click on it. Sorry if that\u2019s confusing,  but it\u2019s just how it happened. If you notice your guy has dropped the  harvest button on the far right side of the screen, you probably fucked  up. It doesn\u2019t ruin the game but it makes it make almost no sense  because you might not be able to see any of the text. You should just  wait until he drops it himself, and then you\u2019re free to click on that  button as much as you want. If you get stuck, just restart the game.  It\u2019s not a hard game, but you should be aware of the consequences of  your actions, just up-front, because I don\u2019t want to get 999 comments  about how you clicked the harvest button as soon as it appeared and then  the game kinda broke. Yes, I could have made that impossible. But then  that would have interrupted MY own sense of ludonarrative consonance.  Also, I spent 14 hours working on what is essentially a giant cutscene,  and you want me to do MORE work? \r\n</p>\n<p>No way, Jos\u00e9. I\u2019ve got a life, you know.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:12:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bfaf9cc815daf16e945906ffc06944.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["PileOfAmoebas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
