When it comes to story-telling, I'm naturally drawn to more abstract phrases than explicitly stated events \u2014\u00a0I think this lends itself to letting players impress their own interpretation upon the piece rather that just handing them some straightforward answer. I also leaned into minimal pixel aesthetics to complement the abstraction in text and mechanics.</p>\n<p>On the more technical side, I used the Unity slider component to create this walking mechanic where the \"feet\" would offset each other as they're moved. Through setting parenting/enable \u00a0functions in the UI buttons I was able to produce this writing ~almost~ no code. (I have\u00a0scripts for playing audio and scene management)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10b/10bef66bb314bac76b229d23daa7e615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eastoned"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
