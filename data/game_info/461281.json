I truly appreciate anyone who finds the time to play it, and I hope it brings you a bit of entertainment and joy.<br/></p>\n\n<p>For years, 3DBenchy has been one of the most popular models in the 3D printing community. It seems however that such fame and fortune doesn't come without paying a price. In <em>Save the Prints, </em>Benchy has turned on its creators, and seeks to destroy any prints that might compete with it for supremacy in the 3D printing world.</p>\n<p>A never ending fleet of Benchies has taken over your Prusa MK3s printer, and will exact revenge on print jobs that challenge its power. Your prints are in danger, but you have a growing defense system of moveable filament extruding turrets, blocking support structures, and glue sticks to gum up the  Benchies' works. Will you let the Benchy armada rein supreme, or battle back to save your prints once and for all?<br/><br/><strong>features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>28 of the most popular community modeled 3D prints to save</li><li>3 types of in-game unlockable defense towers with unique functions and strategy</li><li>In game difficulty tuning for finding the perfect challenge, fun time-passer, or insane murder boat settings</li><li>Customize your print, supports, and extruder gun filament colors however you want (If only it were so easy in real life)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Open Source Project</strong></p>\n<p>Many of the 3D print models in the game are sourced from the incredible 3D printing community. A list of these models and where to download them, along with the Unity project and source code for <em>Save the Prints</em> is available for free on GitHub here <strong>(https://github.com/nuehado/SaveThePrints)</strong>. </p>\n<p>If you have any bugs to report, have feature/3D models that you'd like to see added to the game, or would otherwise like to get involved with this game's continued development, consider joining us on Discord using this link https://discord.com/invite/7ZWD2Yx .Your input is greatly appreciated!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Special Thanks<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Great appreciation towards Prusa3D and Creative Tools for granting me permission to use the likenesses of the MK3s printer and 3DBenchy model in this game.
