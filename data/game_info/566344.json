Contestants start on opposite ends of a single race track, one moving forward, the other backward in time. Players can't interact directly and instead need to lay traps for their opponent to gain the upper-hand and reach the pile of bananas at the end of their respective timeline!\u00a0Grab the floating bananas littered throughout the track and rain their peels down on on the other player with the press of a button!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>OUR TEAM:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>check out the tutorial option in the main menu for more details on how to play!</li><li>the character select screen doesn't really serve a purpose lol, we didn't have time to implement selectable skins -- human/monkey player are functionally the same and assigned via the order the controllers are plugged in.</li><li>YOU NEED TWO XINPUT CONTROLLERS TO PLAY!
