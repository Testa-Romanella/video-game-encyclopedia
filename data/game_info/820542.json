He says he has the perfect spell, and it's legit this time. We'll see about that.</p>\n\n<p>Gamepad recommended, but not required. (Note: Firefox doesn't support gamepad controls! Chrome does. Other browsers untested.)</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D | Left Stick - Move</p>\n<p>W/Space | A(Bottom Button) - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Shift | Bumpers/Triggers - Magic!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hints for movement (Try playing first! Come back if you need help after the start of the second level):</p>\n<p>The dice movement is totally random on the ground. However in the air, it's decided by which part of the jump you press the button in (specifically, your vertical velocity). It's all about the timing.<br/></p>\n<p>Rising = double jump</p>\n<p>Peak = dash</p>\n<p>Falling = shrink</p>\n\n<p>Challenge moves and routes:</p>\n<p>All the moves are  based on vertical velocity, so with careful timing you can chain moves together, and do moves in non-obvious places. The timing is consistent, but very tight.<br/></p>\n<p>Ledge dash = Shift just after leaving a ledge to consistently dash without jumping.</p>\n<p>Jump dash = Dash immediately after finishing a double jump for vertical and horizontal distance.<br/></p>\n<p>Double dash = Two dashes are possible by dashing again immediately after the first finishes, before your vertical velocity goes too low. Can be combined with ledge dash and jump dash.<br/></p>\n<p>There are challenge routes on the first and second level. On the first level, look up. On the second level, look down. If anyone actually completes these, let me know. I will be VERY impressed, cause they are HARD.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:   </p>\n<p>LAN Labs   </p>\n<p>Luis (https://whatifzeldawasagirl.itch.io/) - Audio   </p>\n<p>Avery (https://aveaf.itch.io/) - Art   </p>\n<p>Nathan (https://countthrepe.itch.io/) - Code</p>\n<p>All art, music, and (almost all) code was created during the 48 hour window, no pre-made assets were used.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e435709691aea08c40ff743d6350a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CountThrepe", "Luis", "Aveaf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
