{"id": 55670, "slug": "techno-cop", "name": "Techno Cop", "name_original": "Techno Cop", "description": "<p>Techno Cop is a 1988 action video game for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS and ZX Spectrum. It was subsequently ported to the Sega Genesis in 1990. The gameplay combines pseudo-3D driving in the graphical style of Outrun with side-scrolling action as the player controls a police officer driving to and then moved through various seedy locations in a one-man war against crime. The game was the first game on the Genesis to have a warning label due to its violent content.</p>\n<p>An NES version was developed by Probe Software and supposed to be released in 1992 by Tengen, but was cancelled as Tengen scrapped the idea for the game, due to legal troubles Tengen was dealing with from Nintendo. Only a few sprite-sheets and music by Jeroen Tel exist from the project.</p>\n<p>The game was largely panned by video game critics for its simplistic graphics, sound, and the fact that many of the levels looked too similar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8e3f791971968a95dd63c228a9db77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "Apple II", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Gray Matter Interactive", "Gray Matter", "Imagexcel"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["U.S. Gold", "Gremlin Interactive", "Gremlin Graphics", "RazorSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
