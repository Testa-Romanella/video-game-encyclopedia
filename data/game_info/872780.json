If your ship takes too much damage from asteroids, runs too low on oxygen, or uses all its fuel, PAL will kill you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUtilities (engine, lights, oxygen) consume fuel, and can be turned on and off manually. If a utility breaks, it does not consume fuel, but must be fixed before it can turn on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring the mission, PAL will break your utilities and periodically search the ship's corridors. If she finds you anywhere other than the cockpit, or if you fail while repairing a utility, PAL will kill you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T02:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e85262af41cf90801c34e608c203fc59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gus Jewell"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gus Jewell"], "esrb_rating": null}
