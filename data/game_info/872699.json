We're sure there couldn't be much wrong on this flight, in fact there's a lot<strong> right </strong>with it now; we've introduced a far better alternative to that soggy boring packet food you remember! Mr Buns Burgers is supplying Quay Airlines with the best quality product, to ensure a happy and delicious flight.</p>\n<p><em>Play as humanity's last hope, a small, unlikely but determined hero who puts guts over brains to save the world!<br/>Supports Xbox controller and keyboard + mouse.

The two have spent about 4 days total on the game but the majority of the hard work went into the last 24 hours. As of the writing of this description, the build still has not been tested, so we'll leave future Kim and Calvin to deal with that potential mess.
