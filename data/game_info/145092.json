I made a game called: Shoot That Ship. It's a game made in GameMaker: Studio. When I started programming this game, I was a real newbie. I followed HeartBeast's Udemy course for the basics.</p>\n<p>I developed the game further and asked some friend for extra textures and ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Description of the game:</strong> Shoot that ship is a 2d arcade game. For now you have 2 game modes: Casual and Story.</p>\n<p><strong>Description casual:</strong> You're a ship with a mission: Shoot all enemies. Each kill you get 5 points, every 100 points, it's got a little more difficult, more enemies will spawn and even begin to shoot you!</p>\n<p>You can find 2 different power-ups: +1 Health and Quad shooter. The power=ups and enemies spawn random, so you can't follow the same route.</p>\n<p><strong>Description Story:</strong> You need a <strong>DLC</strong> to play this mode! You are Edornan Edquson, a soldier from the SWD (Space Warfare Defense). You must complete missions and collect items to complete the story!</p>\n<p><strong>Features we are working on:</strong><br/>Infected - You play as the Enemy Boss Ship. You can spawn alien ships to kill all human ships. The opposite of casual!<br/>Mobile Support - Play on Android, IOS and Windows Phone!<br/>Mac OSX Support - This speaks for itself!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do we do with the money?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We use it to buy licences for releasing on other platforms!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/704/7045eb518dcb20c4ef07ffa8305d063f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UniFuseStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
