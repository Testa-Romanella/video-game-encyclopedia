How can we accomblish that without making a mess.</p>\n<p>-2) After some seconds of facing one of the walls -OR the EXIT door of the bathroom the creative thinking takes place!</p>\n<p>-3) LONG term memory recall : During exiting the room we recall what we were doing before the need TO enter the room.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 -when we are happy- is the most creative one. Sitting AND fulfilling your goal in the bathroom make the brain work much better so thats when you find ways to become more productive at various aspects of your life!</p>\n<p>The problem is when we are in stage 2 AND we are NOT happy with the internal design of the bathroom!</p>\n<p>Thats when Bathroom 10D Design comes in place!!!</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>This program takes the 3D design AND adds the 7 more missins 'D''s .\u00a0</p>\n<p>The 7Ds are our imagination!
