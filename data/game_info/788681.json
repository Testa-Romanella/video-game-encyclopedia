It likely has\u00a0scaling bugs depending on the device you are running on (Leave a comment if there are game breaking bugs\u00a0and I will publish an updated WebGL build for browser).\u00a0 All models, textures, rigging,\u00a0animations, scripting,\u00a0main game music/dialogue and fonts were made from scratch by a tiny version of myself with big dreams. I didn't even know what a texture was at the start of this project, nor had I opened Unity or Blender before.\u00a0I hope to (with more wisdom) create something I am willing to get this lost in again.
