As a lonely pawn in a world where die-on-pawn violence is at an all time high, you must survive your treacherous journey across the playing field, collecting good dice to roll with to propel you forward, while dealing with the nasty evil dice that are out to get you! You'll have to be careful, \u00a0make good use of the laser pistol you have, for some reason (what kinda board game is this again?), and stop by at dice-worshipping spots and pledge your blood to the pentagram to gain invaluable upgrades. Post your high score in the comments!</p><p>On a more serious note, this was my first godot game and as a result I spent most of the jam just feeling my way around the engine and working out the basics. I didn't get much time to playtest and as such, there are a number of features that were either left on the cutting room floor, or are implemented very poorly. The balance is also wack AF. Thanks for playing though, I appreciate it :)<br/><br/></p><p>Known bugs:</p><ul><li>Your gun start to not workey sometimes :/</li><li>If two evil cubes come charging at you and you can't kill them, that's it for that round lol. Go send that text you've been meaning to send, or scroll some socials for a bit, come back when the round ends. Real sorry about this one .-.</li><li>The end text which is meant to show you your final rounds total just says 'null' :p</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T21:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e312a4a8bb34831430378ba6a11e3f65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["who-is-Ellie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
