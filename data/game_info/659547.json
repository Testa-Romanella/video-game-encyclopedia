Check his page out now: https://kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>I was highly inspired by Kenney's latest progress with Godot, so I decided to replace libGDX with Godot this time and learn something new. Unfortunately I had some other appointments this weekend, so time was not my best friend. I actually managed to \"design\" only three levels (if you even call design though lol). But, I would say i reached my goal and learned something new!</p>\n<p>Have fun with the game:</p>\r\nKeyActionAMove Left<br/>DMove Right<br/>W or Space<br/>Jump\r\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e677529b2e017c97a991e0cef823b37d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["elektropapst"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
