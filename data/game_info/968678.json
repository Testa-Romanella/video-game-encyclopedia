Whether a + b = c?<br/>\r\n2. Does a character string contain \"a\"?<br/>\r\n3. Does a \"Maybe we could grab a coffee\" mean \"I have a crush on you\"? (I do not think the automaton for this question has been designed.)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, we will play with the simplest automaton model, Finite State Automaton, and use it to cope with 30 challenges. They come from character string manipulation, binary numbers, and daily life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't worry if you are unfamiliar with Finite State Automaton since this game contains a tutorial to get started quickly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T16:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0e46476f6bc168c757224e41f35ce85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tramolly Game"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tramolly Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
