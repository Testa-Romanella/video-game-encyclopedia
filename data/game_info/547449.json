In this game you play as a knock-off certain evil turtle who has decided that kidnapping princesses is more trouble than it's worth, and is trying to return her to the local red plumber. Unfortunately she is very distraught and\u00a0doesn't realize that you've reached this conclusion, so you're going to have a heck of a time trying to get her there safely. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This game was coded in Smalltalk using Pharo and the GodotTalk virtual machine!</p>\n<p>Music credits: 8 Bit Arcade by HeatleyBros</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a25e5d725f9ebb69023231f5be951d7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Consistency3D"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
