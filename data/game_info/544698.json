Still in the works, but shows its potential. Trying to find a solution for the parallax floating point dilemma. Anyway, nice to see it running on all platforms. On fast machines it might run too fast. Map editor is only in the windows version.\u00a0Have fun. (There seems to be a bug with the keyhit required to start the game when embeded here, but it happens not always... exactly the kind of bug I don't like.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T05:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f40cd2c66860699a47872927a3b891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfkEO1010etc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
