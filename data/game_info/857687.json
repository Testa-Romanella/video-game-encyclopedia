Well forget about it, this is a video game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, you will be able to navigate the intricacies of the scientific and academic worlds! Well not really, you will navigate small orthogonal worlds! But they are full of dangers! You will have a couple of weapons to help you survive! And once you are ready, find the door and get your PhD diploma (mine is pink!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are 32 unique levels, that will gradually teach you how to play before unleashing total madness!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy a random level generator, for infinite replay (warning: not all level can be finished)!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreate your own levels using the editor! Share them with your friends as simply as sending a text (a bit of a weird text, but the levels are saved as text)!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose one of 4 skins to personalize your game! Or make your own, if you feel like an artist!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPaint yourself into corners, become unable to finish the level, restart and try again!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRead exclamation marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T04:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e419beaac4e3b888d899fecf05c3107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bras_casse"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["bras_casse"], "esrb_rating": null}
