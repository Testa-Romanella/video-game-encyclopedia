Work in a poorly-optimized kitchen, making nachos and burgers for your customers! They all have a preference for differently-colored plates! Check out the TV monitor to see what food they want.</p>\n<p>Hit the button to the left of the levers above the conveyor belt to make your meal. If you can't keep up with your customers, they explode!<br/></p>\n<p>You know. Like all humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>This is VR, so just reach out and touch stuff! Use the main trigger for interaction; you can just hit the wall buttons, no clicking required.</p>\n<p>You can play without VR using VRTK's simulation mode, but you won't be able to play very well - a HTC Vive is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Story</strong></p>\n<p>I hadn't made a sizeable program in years, and have never made a game of my own design (though I have remade a couple of games from the C-64). The ShenaniJam was the perfect chance to learn Unity and how to work with VR.</p>\n<p>I took this jam on solo as I wasn't sure I could finish. The Butterscotch Shenanigans guys were right - this was really rewarding and has left me with a renewed motivation for making stuff.</p>\n<p>The theme I was randomly assigned was, you guessed it:\u00a0Nacho-Burger Gradient.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Audio is a mix of recorded sounds from my wife (the \"mmm\", grumble, and eating sounds), as well as free audio from the Sonisss.com GDC Audio Bundles from 2015/2016/2017. Plus the Wilhelm Scream.</p>\n<p>3D assets were purchased from the Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>Virtual Reality Toolkit (VRTK), a free library, really sped along development by making setting up the controls a vastly easier endeavor than building them from scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bf5cfa1696421791df55c1ee1bb12cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eltea"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
