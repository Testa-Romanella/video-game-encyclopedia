They have lived in the underground world since 65 million years ago. Facing the harsh underground environment, they have advanced civilization and advanced science and technology far superior to human beings. It is their dream to replace human beings to live on land, and they have made a conquest plan for tens of millions of years. As the earth's resources become increasingly barren, human beings gradually explore underground, and their plans are forced to start ahead of schedule. An unprecedented disaster broke out at the end of the Earth's 3047 years. A mysterious virus caused two thirds of the people in the world to suffer from muscle atrophy, respiratory failure and blindness to varying degrees, and finally died gradually in pain.
