I hope you player understand. But who knows, future updates may come to improve the project? Ideas abound. What I lacked was clarity and a sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game. Comment so I can evolve the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T12:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63ac5652517bcc28e77ec81c1ec4f31b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neobiel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
