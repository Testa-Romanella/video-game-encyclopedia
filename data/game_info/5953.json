Magazine 2011 &amp;amp; 2012<br/>\u2022 App Madness Tournament Champion Sept 2011<br/>\u2022 Pocket Gamer Gold Medal<br/><br/>When veteran video game designers John and Ste Pickford discovered a mysterious bundle of papers hidden in the family attic, who could have guessed it would lead to one of the best new modern puzzle games in years?<br/><br/>To John and Ste&amp;#39;s delight their work revealed an addictive, compelling, and completely original strategic puzzle game, which they named &amp;#39;Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint&amp;#39;.  <br/><br/>The game plays very much like pool, using intuitive touch controls.  The twist is that balls of the same colour stick together magnetically when they touch.<br/><br/>Magnetic Billiards tables have no pockets, instead balls are removed by building clusters of connected balls, with extra rewards for creating recognised cluster shapes. <br/><br/>Points are scored based on the skill displayed and risks taken each shot, and grades are awarded for the total score earned when a table is cleared.<br/><br/>Clearing a table is the easy part.  Trying to earn high scores and achieve high grades is where the surprising genius of the game becomes apparent.<br/><br/>Sure, anyone can beat an F grade, but will you ever get an A grade?  Is there a higher grade than A?  Can you unlock all the tables?<br/><br/>Although easy to play the game is fiendishly addictive, as the simple game mechanic is deceptively subtle and deep.  Even after months of play you&amp;#39;ll still be figuring out new ways to beat your previous best scores and grades.<br/><br/>As you aim for higher and higher you&amp;#39;ll realise that no two games of Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint are ever alike.  Re-playing each table presents you with an endlessly fascinating challenge, as new strategic decisions need to be made with every shot to maximise the points earned.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Its magic though comes from Nintendo-esque levels of refinement, with each table a honed masterpiece of risk and opportunity&amp;quot; - The Guardian<br/><br/>&amp;quot;an original gameplay concept, tweaked to near-perfection, and steeped in character.
