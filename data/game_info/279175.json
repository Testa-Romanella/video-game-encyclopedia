Each card features 1-3 birds in one of four colors \u2014 red, green, yellow, purple \u2014 with the reverse of the card having either the same number of birds in a different color or the same color of birds in a different number. Thus, each number+color combination appears five times in the deck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc8a31f7dc0e4c49ed11abf1b38d087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ycyclop games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family"], "publishers": ["Gilad Yarnitzky"], "esrb_rating": null}
