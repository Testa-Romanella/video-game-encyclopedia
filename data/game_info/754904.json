It\u2019s up to you: dedicate yourself to one person or be the player and spread the love around. It's your choice.<h3>The people of Shale Hill</h3><h3>Leah</h3><br/><br/><br/>You have a special relationship with Leah, who has been supportive of you your entire life. Gentle on the outside, but unflinching and spirited within, she is a stubborn journalism student who will do anything to reveal to the world the dark truth of Shale Hill.<h3>Sam</h3><br/><br/><br/>You and Sam came from opposite ends of your old school\u2019s pecking order, now by a twist of fate your best friend. Your quirky, distractible friend seems uncharacteristically melancholy. What is going on?<h3>Emily</h3><br/><br/><br/>Objectivity and a total focus on success are the main characteristics of Emily. She isn't afraid to make tough decisions, even if this means messing up her relationships with other people. You\u2019d know. You\u2019re her ex.<h3>Valerie</h3><br/><br/><br/>Valerie, Student Council President in college as well as your old highschool, still considers you her protege even after you gave it all up. She seems to have a great deal of faith in you, though you can never tell whether she\u2019s joking or flirting.<h3>Haley</h3><br/><br/><br/>Blue hair that shows an adorable defiance. That\u2019s Haley, a lovely bartender who has dreams way bigger than being behind a counter for the rest of her life. She has a good ear for others' problems but no taste for sharing her own.<h3>Maggie</h3><br/><br/><br/>Maggie prefers dealing with animals to people, but over time, she has come to trust you. Now, this pretty redhead will need to deal with a past that has left her nervous and silent.<h3>Lidia</h3><br/><br/><br/>The impeccable and refined owner of the campus caf\u00e9, Lidia is a well travelled connoisseur of everything that can be roasted and brewed. But in her travels, she\u2019s brought problems back with her.<h3>Alexis</h3><br/><br/><br/>As Shale Hill\u2019s resident mean girl, Alexis takes her popularity for granted, but she\u2019s not as simple as she seems. Alexis also considers herself an entrepreneur, and seems undeterred that her business of choice is highly unethical.<h3>Linus</h3><br/><br/><br/>Your colleague and workmate, Linus can be both a comrade and an annoying smug asshole, usually both at the same time. He\u2019s an unrepentant geek and much more comfortable in the tech world than you are.<h3>Dante</h3><br/><br/><br/>Dante is the ultimate paradoxical Bohemian. A weird mix of party freak and dependable role model, he\u2019s a hard man to describe, and you don\u2019t really know him unless you meet him. He dispenses cocktails and wisdom with equal flare, and has his ear to the ground in Shale Hill\u2019s party scene.<h3>Toasterman</h3><br/><br/><br/>Homeless man or superhero? The answer depends on whether you ask him or anyone else. One thing is for sure, he does have detective instincts that you don\u2019t have. It\u2019s wise to listen to what he has to say.<br/><br/>This installment of Shale Hill Secrets contains the first four episodes of our story.
