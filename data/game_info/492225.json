{"id": 492225, "slug": "pop-up-blaster", "name": "Pop up Blaster", "name_original": "Pop up Blaster", "description": "Pop up Blaster is a game that allows you to shoot popups with guns, and has various options that allow you to change everything from how hard the game is, to how the game looks and sounds. In total, there are seven different settings, if you include difficulty. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- How to play -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- starting a round -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the cursor, left click the power button on the in game computer. To instantly end a round, you can left click on the power button again, if your score is at least higher than the lowest high score, it will be saved<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you start a round, you will only have access to a hand gun, however as you gain points from shooting pop ups, you will be able to upgrade it to an auto hand gun, and then to a machine gun. You can also unlock a shot gun as well as explosives, the explosives will destroy all the pop ups on the screen at the same time, with the upgrade being a faster reload time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- Attacking -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you move the cursor far enough into the in game screen, your current weapon will appear, left click anywhere in the screen to use your current weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach weapon has a different rate that it can constantly fire at, with the slowest being the shot gun, and the fastest being the machine gun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can hold down the left mouse button to fire continuously, or press and release it to fire a single shot.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe grenade and dynamite work differently than the other weapons, both have a delay between the time that you use the weapon, and the time that the weapon detonates. You can switch to another weapon and shoot popups while they are flying through the air.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- reloading -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor the exception of the grenade and dynamite, each weapon has a maximum amount of ammo, when they run out you have to reload them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen they run out of ammo, their icon will change to \"reload weapon\", and \"reload weapon\" will appear above the in game screen. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLeft click on the \"reload weapon\" icon and a reload animation will start. When the animation completes, the weapon will be reloaded. You can switch your current weapon while you wait for the weapon to reload. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen the weapon is reloaded you can switch back to it, or use your current weapon until it runs out of ammo, and then reload it and switch back.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can not switch to a weapon that needs to be reloaded, nor can you upgrade the weapon, even if you have enough points to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe grenade and dynamite are both one shot weapons and have to be reloaded every time that you use them. (The reason being that if you throw the grenade you are holding, you are therefore, no longer holding a grenade)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- unlocking and upgrading -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen the round starts, you will only have access to a hand gun, to unlock the other weapons, click the unlock weapon button that is next to their icon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo upgrade a weapon, click the upgrade weapon button that is next to its icon. For the exception of the grenade and dynamite, when you unlock, or upgrade a weapon, you will automatically switch to that weapon. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen a weapon can no longer be upgraded, the upgrade button for that weapon will be crossed out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen the cursor is hovering over an upgrade button, it will become highlighted to show that it can be activated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- switching weapons -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe weapon icons as well as the unlock and upgrade buttons are to the right of the in game screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can switch to a weapon as long as it is unlocked, and does not need to be reloaded. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo switch to a weapon, left click on its icon with the cursor.
