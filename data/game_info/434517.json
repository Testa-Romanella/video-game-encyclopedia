The puzzles are based on the well known \u201cconnect the pipes\u201d puzzle, but with a simple twist: you can\u2019t see the whole puzzle completely, you must base your solution on the plans that are scattered around the map (the plans are always close to the puzzle it depicts). Move by clicking your mouse (ARPG/Diablo style). We did not make our own humanoid animations, we used Kevin Iglesias\u2019 free Unity Assets. We also used sound effects from freesound.org, but the music is custom made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5b2d80261a0941673d1251a11c8554.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jpnwl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
