You decide you\u2019ll skip the festivities this year as you settle into your new home, expecting teenagers to welcome you to the neighbourhood by egging your house and toilet-papering your trees, per Devil\u2019s Night tradition. Instead, you get a visit from 3 handsome Halloween Ghosts, who try to convince you to stop being a scrooge and give the holiday a chance. Will they convince you that it\u2019s worth getting in the Halloween spirit after all? Or will you just spend the entire time trying to flirt with them?</p>\r\nNote:\r\n<ul><li> Due to time constraints, this SpooktoberVNJam Submission consists of the intro and chapter 1 of the full game (about 30% of the story).
