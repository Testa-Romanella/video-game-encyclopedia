In order to fend off this predator, you have to sacrifice some of your animals and food resources. Wave by wave, you have to sacrifice more to keep up with the demands. To do that you have to build a balanced ecosystem, in which your animals can breed. If you neglect that aspect, you will find yourself with little to no God Points (currency) left and lose, as soon as the demands of the bear become too big.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:23:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd64a46499318dca1695c6c49b78adae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danielk0703", "Sauerkraut"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
