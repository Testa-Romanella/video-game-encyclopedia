After playing these games, I wanted to make a game which focused more on the ability of the player to actually make contact with the ball and aim it.</p><p>This is a prototype of the system that I came up with. In it, players play a wall ball style game, where they must hit the ball as close to the center of targets on the wall as possible. When the ball hits the ground, tiles drop out, making players think more about how they are going to maneuver around the court. </p><p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/191b02564c4cee9b7de465d34466dfe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lee2121"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
