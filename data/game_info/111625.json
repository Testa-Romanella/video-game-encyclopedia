The gameplay is similar to the famous game \"Pong\". This game isn't finished we are working on it ! It is just an alpha. ( 1st game be nice \u2665 ). \u00a0The goal is to kill terrorists and make destruction with killstrikes. For example if you kill 10 terrorits the game will load a Humvee and this one will kill other insurgents. \u00a0The game will be developed a lot , i think about 2 players mod and more contents (choice of weapons, choice of side,choice of difficulty , and probably more maps).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/933f9cb6a9b69fcb8a270f2da2821248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matbabs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
