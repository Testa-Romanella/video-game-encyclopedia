It's a very relaxed game about exploring an underwater environment and discovering various fish and plant life.<br/>\r\n\t We really enjoyed making this game, and had a lot of ideas we couldn't fit into a game jam entry, so are currently working on a full-release version that we hope to complete some time in 2017.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 34, and the theme was Growing. We incorporated the theme quite loosely for this game jam, but the basic idea was that swimming over holes in the rock would make plants grow, and you would end up with an nice underwater garden after a while. Our main aim for this game was to create a nice mood and atmosphere, which would give players a relaxing environment to explore free of any peril or time pressures. It also acted as a test version for a larger underwater game that we're are currently working on.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Mouse \u2013 Hold the left button to make the diver swim towards the cursor<br/>\r\n\t Gamepad \u2013 Use the left stick to move the diver\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere isn't any real danger in this game, to complete it you just need to discover all the fish and plant life. If you need any help then try exploring from left to right on the bottom of the ocean, and then from right to left starting at the top of the sunken city.</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98aa7913b01f44a4dfc76dd4c0eee287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
