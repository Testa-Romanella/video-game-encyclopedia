Owl Knight is heavily based off of Yacht Club Games' 'Shovel Knight.' When creating this game, Team Night Owls, who became Night Owl Studios, was told to choose a reference game, in this case Shovel Knight, and create a clone that utilizes the base mechanics of the reference game. Owl Knight contains much of the same mechanics and even clones of the bosses.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy Night Owl Studios' last project as game design students, and first game shipped to PC!</p>\n\n<p>Complete list of resources:\u00a0Owl Knight Resources</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbae1af1ef77bbaed404c835b81a2f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Night Owl Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
