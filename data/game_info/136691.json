After the fall of the Romanov family, the palace has been abandoned and is still under the curse of Rasputin; that's why it's full of ghosts. It also preserves all the treasures of the family, including several Faberg\u00e9 eggs. Niko, our protagonist, believes that she\u2019s the legitimate heir of one of these eggs, the 'Memory of Azov', and that is why she enters the haunted palace to recover it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c98aa3ba5243a89c40834b93f096da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jerometa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
