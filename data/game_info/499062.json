After a cataclysmic\r\nevent, drones have destroyed most of human life. However, a small group of people still fight on! The resources are scares and moral is low. The resistance desperately needs more power shards to continue on... You are part of this resistance and you're in luck. The resistance has finally found a way to create stable wormholes to create temporary time loops. With this new found ability a brave soul can travel back in time, when the drones were still small in numbers, and steal their power shards. You have been chosen to be sent back and save the resistance. Be careful though! No one knows how stable the portal is...</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Time Heist is a top down shooter. Move with the WASD keys and shoot with the left mouse button. You can reload you gun with the R key. You play through the same level multiple times with a decreasing timer. During the third time you'll have to make your way through the wormhole or you'll be stuck forever! Try to collect as many shards in that time as possible.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Game made by Artur Salek for the VimJam game jam</li>\n<li>Game made in Visual Studio with the Monogame Library</li>\n<li>Sprites made in Paint.NET</li>\n<li>Music made in beepbox.co</li>\n<li>Sound effects made in SXFR</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff1ba55df503eecd334a31371c3fd76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hartoe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
