I've read much more than I wrote about and would love to extend that game towards a phonetic study of first names, and maybe use that bare-bone endeavor as a basis for something more, should need arise.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c91/c9172d53c2b9bd9562c50fb85b19f416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Schwatterer"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
