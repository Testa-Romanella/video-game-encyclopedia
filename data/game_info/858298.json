{"id": 858298, "slug": "clover-liero", "name": "Clover (Liero)", "name_original": "Clover (Liero)", "description": "<p>Clover is a game where you explore a mysterious book. Each page will challenge you with a unique puzzle or riddle. Your objective (most of the time) is\u00a0to work out and enter a password which will let you proceed to the next page. It is not an involved game and you can have it as something in the background.</p>\n<p>The game contains 41 puzzles/riddles (excluding the secrets). Puzzle pages can also branch out giving your more information, or dividing a puzzle into a few steps.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by notpron and the gameplay is similar to an internet riddle.\u00a0However, it provides easier navigation around the puzzles and introduces some interesting gimmicks along the way.</p>\n<p>Clover has 3 background ambience options, but\u00a0music is\u00a0muted by default. You can turn\u00a0it on in the options tab, but I recommend playing music you enjoy in the background. I've never made ambience before and I don't think any of my loops really fit the mysterious yet not serious\u00a0mood.</p>\n\n<p>Everything in this game was made by me (Liero) and it's my first project. It's a very unusual creation,\u00a0 but I hope you are nerdy enough to enjoy it! ^^</p>\n<p>Oh and if you have any feedback, or you caught any errors is my mediocre english, please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T10:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39dc94b6337588481e7a8c74cb34e079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liero"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
