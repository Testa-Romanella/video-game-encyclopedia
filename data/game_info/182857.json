Enter a fight to the death competition and never have to pay taxes again. <br/><br/>Requires two players. Make sure you launch in windowed mode, and select 640x480 as your resolution. I recommend setting it to 'Beautiful,' because there is nothing render heavy. <br/><br/>Note: This game was created by me and two friends for Ludum Dare 32. The game was rushed and feature creep in the beginning lead to a mediocre game, because we spent more time on assets than making the game work! We definitely learned a lot from this one!</p><p>LD32 Results:</p><p>#541   Humor(Jam)<br/>#577   Audio(Jam)<br/>#897   Graphics(Jam)<br/>#899   Mood(Jam)<br/>#900   Theme(Jam)<br/>#938   Innovation(Jam)<br/>#957   Overall(Jam)<br/>#960   Fun(Jam)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c944f1a7af07208744a131420a0c04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitfrost"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
