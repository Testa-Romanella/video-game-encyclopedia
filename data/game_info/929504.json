These happy couples stand in the way between you and true love (or at least the hot girl on the other end of the restaurant at speed dating night!) Ruin each date one at a time to inch your way closer to the woman of your dreams.<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/> Use A and D to move left and right, knocking things over and throw spiders. Doing this when nobody is looking will cause your enemies dates to go poorly, causing them to leave and allowing you to swoop in. But be careful! If anybody can see you you'll eventually get kicked out for being a nuisance!</p><p>Credits<br/>A game made by Safety Dad Studios and Itty Bitty Kimchi<br/>Character Art - Cheryl Cruz<br/>3D Art, Lighting, and Logo - Jared<br/>Programming and Game Design - Alex Rose<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc7/cc715c899b4bcf23905a1c2d3af78b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SafetyDad"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
