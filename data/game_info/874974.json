An apprentice at a small-town potion shop is out looking for ingredients when she accidentally falls into a cave. A cave with monsters in it, as it happens. Despite her lacking much combat skill beyond blocking and throwing potions, the apprentice apothecary Brill is thrust into an adventure, with the fate of the entire continent of Ruphand hanging in the balance. It may seem like a story you've heard before. But not everything is quite as it seems...</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Ruphand: an Apothecary's Adventure,</em> the player follows Brill Yance, whose only offensive skill is throwing bottles at things until they go away. By using Sample to scrounge up ingredients off the ground, Brill can mix up a variety of potions, which are also her primary means of defense.</p>\n<p>Every move- whether it's one of Brill's potions, or a monster attack- has an associated Windup time and Delay time. By paying attention to how fast it'll take to ready attacks, strategically blocking attacks, and employing the status effects associated with each of the six elements, the player can avoid damage and fight back against powerful foes.</p>\n<p>First released in 2017 on RPG Maker Net, Ruphand is soon to return to active development. The present version of the game provides at least twenty hours of gameplay, and it's still not finished; there's still more story to tell!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T09:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c481c1e15a5866e9e09a49212a654eb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorSpacebar"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
