Real dinosaurs.</strong><br/><br/>So, if you're on this store page, I guess you want to know what this game is about, huh? Well, let me tell you: it's a doozy. Everyone read about the American Revolution, right? Here's what the history books won't tell you:<br/><br/>There were dinosaurs. <br/><br/>Not really, but go with it. Journey with Poe and Imogen, two reluctant Dinosaur Farmers, as their quiet corner of the world is thrust into the heart of the American Revolution! Now, they must brave the bullets and cannons and try to find peace in a world gone mad. You'll go from scenic winter cabins to tropical rainforest in an effort to win the war, because that's the only way you know how to get away from the war!<br/><br/>At least, that's what you're SUPPOSED to be making. The Reality Developers Conference (RDC) is weeks away, and you're supposed to be presenting your current project: the American Revolutionary War, but this time with Dinosaurs. Only you have writer's block. Can you make this the BEST AMERICAN REVOLUTION EVER? Or will your work be overshadowed by, say, the Dark Ages but this time with mechs?<br/><br/><ul><li> 10 dinosaurs, each with their own skills to utilize in battle!</li></ul><ul><li> 5 historic fronts of the American Revolution, now with 100% more whimsy! Because that's what war lacks, right?</li></ul><ul><li> This game has politics up the bum.</li></ul><ul><li> Maybe you'll learn some Shakespeare. Probably not. This is our most inaccurate adaptation yet. OR IS IT?</li></ul><ul><li> Strategy/Visual Novel/Adventure game. Whatever.</li></ul><ul><li> Three story points that, depending on what numbers they are at, affect the ending in a few ways.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T02:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc776ce3d39faa1e74b6bb783905967d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
