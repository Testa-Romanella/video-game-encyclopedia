The finished game contains 50 levels, but unfortunately I lost the executable for that when Kagi changed their website (the distribution channel I was using to sell my game) it appears the files were gone, too! The game sold about 50 copies, to mainly female audience.</p><p>My company is now Tigris Games LLC. But in 2003 I ran my game business under Fallout Software, Inc. This is why the branding is seen the way it is in the current demo. It's a relic!</p><p>I am currently in the process of looking for the original game files, and a possibility of creating a remake of Briefcase using the brand new OpenGL engine, with more items, more levels, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a386be6f3b9eadbfcb723fcb736aa75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tigris"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
