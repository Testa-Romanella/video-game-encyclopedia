You have created a weather machine that will reverse Global Warming...by freezing the Earth. The humans do not like that, and are trying to shut you down. STOP THEM!<br/><br/></p>\r\nGoal of the Game:\r\n<p>Keep the enemy from destroying your device by shooting any enemies that approach!</p>\n<p>No Mercy!<br/></p>\n<br/>Controls:\r\n<p>WASD to move the character.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to aim.</p>\n<p>Left Click to Shoot.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I realize that is a bare bones game in terms of content. This game was mostly for my own education on working in a 3D environment in Unity. Given more time, I would <br/>definitely flesh it out with:</p>\n<ul><li>More Enemy Types</li><li>More complex Level Design</li><li>Increasing Difficulty</li><li>Better Targeting</li><li>Structuring the game so that the Player moves around the map more</li><li>Overall Artwork</li><li>Music and Sound Effects</li></ul>\n<p>For now,\u00a0 I'd like to present my efforts, and I hope you enjoy my game!</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter any bugs within the game, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your interest!
