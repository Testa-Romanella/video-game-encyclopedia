Your goal is to head these tests. <br/>\r\nWill you destroy the test object using all available arsenal? Here is a wide range of various weapons waiting to be <br/>\r\nused for the most insidious purposes! Melee, energetic, firearm and even a black hole. Combine it at your desire! You may have <br/>\r\na cup of hot coffee while another clone is being ripped by a circular saw and at the same time roasted by a flamethrower. <br/>\r\nCruel?.. Maybe, anyway those test objects are just artificially grown human clones. So whatever, put your feet on the table and <br/>\r\nhave no worry about a thing.
