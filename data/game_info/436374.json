Settings such as \"Minimum time between moves\" and \"Speed &amp; Distance in 1 move\" can help you change your experience depending on how fast/active your chat is, as well as if you want a more tactical approach or straight up chaos (turn up the Speed to 10 and set Time between moves to 0).</p>\n<p>If you're just a viewer or a small streamer\u00a0and want to experience the game fully (by the way, the game is beatable in \"static\" mode too, with 0 platform moves), you can enter some active streamer's chat and put the Randomizer on, it will transform every message into a command, only thing left for you is to Just Jump Up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/34233f70d4e339b0c396bc0672cb8eb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dexyfactor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
