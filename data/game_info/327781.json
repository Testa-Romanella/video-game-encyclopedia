Create influence and movement in a basic frozen space.</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Influence</em>, the player controls an Avatar that attracts Fragments that fall into his area of influence. The player can thus change the layout of the game space around him. <br/><br/>In addition, he has the possibility to create Stars, which also have an influence on the Fragments as well as on other Stars. He will be able to create systems of Stars whose energy is not infinite and which will eventually become extinct if they find themselves isolated from other Stars.\u00a0<br/><br/>With the Modulators, the player will have the ability to change the movement a Star creates on nearby fragments. He has to pass through them, then touch or create a Star to pass the new behaviour.<br/><br/> Moreover, he can\u00a0modify the appearance of a Star using Nebulae the same way he uses modulators.</p>\n<p><strong>Creators\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Alan Caillerez</strong>\u00a0- Programming</li><li><strong>Lucas De Ga\u00ebtano</strong>\u00a0- Programming / Sound Design</li><li><strong>Antoine Gilles</strong>\u00a0- Game Design</li><li><strong>R\u00e9my Hua</strong>\u00a0- Visual Direction</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>ZSQD\u00a0</strong>: Movements (Camera referential)</li><li><strong>AE\u00a0</strong>: Vertical Movements\u00a0(Camera referential)</li><li><strong>Hold\u00a0Shift\u00a0</strong>: Fast Movement</li><li><strong>Left Clic</strong>\u00a0: Attraction</li><li><strong>Right Clic\u00a0</strong>: \u00a0Repulsion</li><li><strong>Space bar</strong>\u00a0: Create Singularity</li><li><strong>R\u00a0</strong>: Enable/disable Release (Become a Fragment)</li><li><strong>H\u00a0</strong>: Enable/disable Modulators and Nebulae</li><li><strong>X\u00a0</strong>: Save (saves at -&gt;.. \\Influence-Beta\\Influence_Data\\Project\\Saves)</li><li><strong>Escape </strong>: Open Menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Number of Fragments\u00a0</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The number of fragments will have an impact on the performance of the game.
