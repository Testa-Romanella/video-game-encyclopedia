We finished working on it right before Charlottesville happened, which is why a lot of the references in the game are outdated (there's Sean Spicer in there, if you remember who that is!)...</p>\n<p>Anyway, we hope you enjoy this little nostalgic romp through the White House of 2017. We'll probably update this page with a lot of the art we did for this, as most people don't have an HTC Vive we're guessing?</p>\n<p>Oh, btw, pls vote this November 2018.
