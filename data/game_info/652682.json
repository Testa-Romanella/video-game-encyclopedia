There\u2019s also an asteroid bonus level where you can break up asteroids for points, and break up bigger asteroids for power-ups, including bonus shields, extra lives, score multiplier, and a faster fire rate.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HINTS</strong>:\u00a0Vector-Z\u2019s ship holds 2 missiles. One fires from each wing, so there\u2019s a slight offset. There is also a brief reload time. Both of these factors make the game a little more interesting and challenging than it first appears. Especially if you are going for all the\u00a0<strong>bonus points</strong>\u00a0from accuracy: at 50% you get 100 pts per hit, 200 pts at 75%, 400 pts at 90%, and 800 bonus pts per hit with 100% accuracy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c09f5cf3aabfed687ede69a0811933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Juggleware"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
