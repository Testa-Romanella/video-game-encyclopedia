The theme of this gamejam is <strong>Combination</strong>, and the first thing I thought of was <strong>Quick Time Events</strong> <strong>(QTE)</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basically a QTE is a sequence or a <strong>combination </strong>of keys/buttons that the player needs press in a limited amount of time in order to perform a certain action in the game. These was usually used in cutscenes in games such as Heavy Rain, or for finishing moves in games like the God of War series.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>Here in this little game of mine, you play as a rebel taking on the alien invasion in the back of your truck. Shoot down the alien space ships and save the world.</p>\n\r\nHOW TO ATTACK?\r\n<p>The battle of this game is fought using <strong>quick time events (QTE)</strong> and every space ship has a random QTE depicted in the screenshot below:</p>\n\n<p>The four QTE keys are mapped to your keyboard's A, S, D, F keys in the following order.</p>\n\n<p>Press your keyboard keys according to the highlighted QTE on screen\u00a0to launch a missile to the alien ship.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n\u00a0<strong>press (A, S, D, F) keys at the same time</strong>\u00a0<strong>press (S, F) keys\u00a0at the same time</strong>\u00a0<strong>press (A, D)\u00a0keys at the same time</strong>\r\n\r\nHOW TO DEFEND?\r\n<p>While it is important to attack, you should also be able to defend yourself. To enable the force field on the truck, <strong>press the (Q, W, E, R) keys</strong> <strong>at the same time </strong>to active the shield.</p>\n\r\nHOW TO SELECT TARGET?\r\n<p>If there is a need to reprioritize your targets, <strong>press (TAB) key</strong> to cycle through the target. Alternatively, you could use your mouse and<strong> click on the space ship</strong> to select it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nYOUR MISSION IS...\r\n<p>Keep your<strong> health bar full </strong>and stop the aliens from invading sweet mother Earth. Stay safe out there comrades.</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>CptFurball (myself - main programmer)<br/></p>\n<p>Ben\u00a0Reber (BGM music)\u00a0</p>\n<p>ToofBerd\u00a0(Gameplay designer\u00a0+ Playtester)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T08:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/498a45830260f2ef0835478d9dc7d882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cpt.Furball"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
