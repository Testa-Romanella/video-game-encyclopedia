I mostly just wanted to archive it somewhere so I could download it when I get old.</p>\n<p>This is a puzzle game where you have to draw lines between numbers so that the numbers add up to some other number. Note that you can use the same number multiple times. Idk if that made sense, but just try it, you'll figure it out.</p>\n<p>Note that some of the small board hard levels may be impossible. I was small and stupid when I made this game so I couldn't write an algorithm to check if a level was impossible when I made it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ad/8ad56083c57867da84b636daf9965166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DennisMagnusson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
