So, we tried our best to replicate the NES aesthetics without trying to\u00a0perfectly\u00a0emulate the\u00a0limitatations of the console (specifically\u00a0on the quantity of graphics, colors and sounds that can be shown or played at a time).<br/>Almost all of the sounds were taken of \"The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection\" from\u00a0OpenGameArt.<br/>We hope you like this game as much as we enjoyed making it. Any feedback will be appreciated.<br/>Cheers!<br/></em></p>\n<p>Developed by Enio Lotero<br/>Art by Mauro Couto</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:11:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a5fc20b7365feff925c3397a29b876.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Enio Lotero", "Mauro Couto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
