By connecting the holes in the\u00a0pieces to the different pegs, you can create an intricate little maze. Be mindful, however, because not all the pegs and pieces will be used every time.</p>\n<p>There are multiple ways to complete each puzzle, so get creative and try new things!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse: Click to pick up and place pieces; move pieces</p>\n<p>A &amp; D: Rotate pieces</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam</p>\n<p>By Jordan Dube</p>\n<p>@Jordanopoly</p>\n<p>jordandubemedia.com</p>\n<p>jordandubemedia@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba6e229150f087b091b05f3544c8be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JordanDubeMedia"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
