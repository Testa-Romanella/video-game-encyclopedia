We suggest reading the guide before playing the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Your loved one is going away on another trip... Before she goes you must gift her a beautiful flower as a symbol of good luck.<br/></p>\r\nGuide\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to harvest a fully grown orchard of luck. Keep your plants adequately watered, and use magical plants to protect your garden from disasters!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Shovel: Left Click to dig, Right Click to remove a hole\r\n</p>\n<p>- Watering Can: Press &amp; hold to water your plants. Make sure not to overwater them. Can also be used to put out fires\r\n</p>\n<p>- Seeds: Place a seed in a hole &amp; watch it grow\r\n</p>\n<p>- Scythe: Harvest an entire plant for some money, or remove a dead one without profit\r\n</p>\n<p>-Snippers: Some plants produce fruit. Snip them off to get money without throwing the entire plant away, they regrow\r\n</p>\n<p>- Bug Net: Swing this at your plants a few times whenever there are pesky bugs trying to eat them\r\n</p>\n<p>- Diary: Your report of what's happened so far. Might be helpful!\r\n</p>\n<p>- Shop &amp; Inventory: Buy seeds in the shop &amp; select which ones to use in the inventory.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Plants:</strong></p>\n<p>- Lovely Petal: A quick &amp; not very hardy plant that can sell for a lot if it grows enough flowers.</p>\n<p>- Sour Fruit: A basic fruiting plant that provides a steady supply of fruit, if you can keep it alive\r\n</p>\n<p>- Thirsty Cactus: A very thirsty plant that makes nearby plants run out of water quicker. Useful to counteract overwatering, but might make it a bit harder to keep things under control\r\n</p>\n<p>- Barrier Berry: While it has fruit still on the bush, it generates a protective shield above it to protect it from skyward threats. You can sell the fruit if you don't think you need the shield\r\n</p>\n<p>- Pinwheel Plant: A pretty thing that while alive will magically deposit a dollar into your bank account every now &amp; then\r\n</p>\n<p>- Bugmuncher: A plant which eats bugs on nearby plants\r\n</p>\n<p>- Phoenix Vine Nut: This plant produces very valuable fruit, but only when it's on fire! Make sure to keep it watered - it might be worth putting out the fire to keep it alive\r\n</p>\n<p>- Orchard of Luck: The most important flower. Takes forever to grow &amp; is difficult to keep alive, but once you harvest it, you win the game\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe884641567b36dcf5cb03af3445b3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Coffe789"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
