The purpose of this game is to just try out an idea and also for me to get my hands into the 3D world of making games since all my previous games were either 2D or 3D but freelance games or a\u00a0 game that I just gave up on.\u00a0 So this is a full-blown,\u00a0 jam-like,\u00a0 game made in a week with a <strong><em>whooping\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong>1 level!
