With Bobbycat, they investigate various gruesome murders, interrogate suspects, and collect clues, until the time comes to accuse the murderer. The games are basically a very long excuse for me to come up with a bunch of rhyming animal names as well as the most heartfelt groan-inducing puns I can think of.</p><p>In Investigator and the Chekhov's Gun, Investigator and his sidekick The Bad Luck Duck dig deeper into what appears to be the suicide of The Bipolar Bear.</p><p>The Investigator Cases are an ongoing series of point-and-click who-dunnits, inspired by games such as Professor Layton and authors such as Agatha Christie. I produce a new super short game every Ludum Dare (i.e., every 3 months).</p><p>You can view and play all Investigator games from here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea91525471dfe2d1ea774fcc43f1538d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theskyandthesea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
