Apparently you're the Chosen One with amazing magic powers, destined to protect the boundary between worlds. Or something.</p>\n<p>One problem: something went wrong with the summoning ritual, and you're stuck in the portal.</p>\n<p>Well, you can still sling spells from here. Defend the portal from the slimes that threaten to escape and threaten your home!<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Turn your character with the W, A, and D keys. Fire a projectile with the spacebar. Press Z or the Slow button to temporarily slow down all slimes currently on-screen.<br/></p>\n<p>Your character loses health if a slime reaches them, and it's game over if your health hits 0.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Except as noted below and in CREDITS.txt, all assets were created by the developer within the 72-hour time period for Mini Jam 114. <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Kenpixel font and variants: Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl), Public Domain/CC0</li><li>kromasky font: Zingot Games (http://www.zingot.com), CC-BY 4.0</li><li>Button click: NenadSimic  License, CC-BY 3.0\r\n</li><li>Other sound effects: Juhani Junkala, Public Domain/CC0</li><li>Game Over and Victory (Finale) music: Avgvst, CC-BY 4.0</li><li>Title screen (Destiny Calls) and main loop (Surprise Attack) music: Trevor Lentz, CC-BY-SA 3.0</li></ul>\n<p>See CREDITS.txt for further details.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78af3b63152cb35c8fb102fcbe8c131e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aran-gilman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
