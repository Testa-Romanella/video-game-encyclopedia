In fact, it's pretty much a dumpster fire in the back.\u00a0Hopefully, nothing breaks on your end, but I'm not holding my breath. Please report any bugs in the Discussion section!\r\n</p>\n<p>The continent of Meridian enters a new era. Two superpowers, the sprawling Federation of York and the isolated\u00a0Suisei Principality, vie for superiority over the untamed territories in the north. The Cartographers' Guild struggles to retain its independence as statesmen and generals make their move on the international stage.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But none of this concerns you. A humble adventurer looking to make their fortune on the unexplored Frontier, all you need to do is to make enough Marks to pay the next bill.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Sable Hearts</em>\u00a0is inspired by classics such as\u00a0<em>Cave Story,\u00a0</em><em>The Legend of Zelda,\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Metroid</em>. To progress in the game, you will need to find items to craft or sell, weapons to match enemies' elemental weaknesses, and friends to help you along the way.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Combat</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every few years, the Sable storms surrounding the continent of Meridian give way to reveal pristine wildlands, ancient Colonial ruins, and various flora and fauna that have never been seen before. Note down their resistances and weaknesses, find a weapon, and cut them down before they do the same to you!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Collection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Collect loot from enemies, natural resources, and treasure chests. Use them to craft a wide variety of food and tools, or sell them to a merchant for some easy Marks. Pore through a library of books and documents to find new recipes, abandoned stockpiles, or just more information about the world. As you learn more, all information is recorded in your handy journal.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Conversations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Chat to characters you encounter to access secret shops, learn about Meridian and the grand schemes in play, or complete side quests.\r\n</p>\n<p>* * *\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T15:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/813e7078770046ffb6117093bb0ee34d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mackerel Sky"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
