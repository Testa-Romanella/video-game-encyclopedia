By repairing your fellow robots, you ensure a reliable and useful collaboration.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim</p>\n<p>Left mouse button - Shoot</p>\n<p>E - Repair inactive robots</p>\n\n<p>To be more in the theme (no actually I would never have had the time to make a complete music in a week end), I used\u00a0MuseNet from OpenAI to compose the music . I also use sfxr to make the sound effects. Finally, I used a particle asset from the Unity Asset Store from Synty Studios.</p>\n<p>I'm quite proud of myself, especially since I could only work half-time the first two days, and not at all the third one: you can almost say that I made this game in 2 days!</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T18:14:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2de/2de0dc972c67552e0e39d6847cb7465f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NicolAme"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
