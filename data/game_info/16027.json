To put a gang out of commission, you must locate and dismantle well-hidden facilities and the gang's leadership. In order to do this, you'll have to interrogate gang members of sufficient rank.Deep Character DevelopmentVigilantes allows you to customise your team to your play-style. The UPLIFT character system is comprised of 6 core stats, nine crime-fighting skills, and a wide variety of game changing perks. With the UPLIFT system, character level is increased by using skills, rather than by gaining XP.Build A Base Of OperationsUse resources \"liberated\" from gangs to build up a base of operations to support your campaign against crime in Reiker. Build and upgrade five facilities: Workshop, Gym, Firing Range, Surgery and Library, to provide your team with buffs, enhanced crafting options, and free resources.Face An Overwhelming EnemyOut-numbered and out-gunned, you must adapt to face over 15 enemy types across three gangs: the swarming, cult-like Church of the Final Exodus, the Survivalists, an elite paramilitary group who more closely resemble an army than a gang, and the Mafia, an insidious enemy, which excels at keeping its activities hidden. Trade punches with heavyweight Mafia Enforcers, outmanoeuvre stalking Survivalist Sharpshooters, and take down crazed, explosive wielding, Church of the Final Exodus Fanatics.Make Friends!You don't have to take on the criminal underworld alone. Find allies on the dark streets of Reiker, including hard-boiled private eye, Ray Case, Reiker City Police Lieutenant Emilia De Soto, and Elena Furey, who is hunting down Survivalists for reasons of her own. You can find a voiced introduction video for each of these allies in the videos section, at the top of the page.Tools Of The TradeWield baseball bats, fire axes, close range, burst fire SMGs, precision rifles, shotguns, incendiary grenades, smoke grenades. Kit out your team with crafted armour, advanced medical devices, and create specialised hot-loaded ammunition which causes increased damage. Don't forget to repair your equipment after combat, to prevent firearms jamming, melee weapons breaking, and to maintain the protective qualities of your armour.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a1219da77c96db61311b5f0a6319dd93.jpg", "website": "http://timeslipsoftworks.com/Vigilantes", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 25, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Timeslip Softworks"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Timeslip Softworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
