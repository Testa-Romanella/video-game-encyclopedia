This should prove no match for your flame gun! Oh, by the way, you have a flame gun... and a grappling hook. Your average pirate Captian.</p>\n<p>I wonder why all these islands are frozen over in the Caribbean? Maybe it has something to due with the Sun God leaving the sky and coming to earth to find whoever stole their flame gun. </p>\n<p>Sucks to be that fellow.</p><p>-------Controls ------------<br/></p>\n<p>A/D: move left right</p>\n<p>Space : Jump</p>\n<p>Left Click: Shoot fire gun</p>\n<p>Right Click: Grapling hook</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:53:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e52a48618baf1fda68423b69ec399578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin W Cain - AffinityForFun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
