The simulation demonstrates the relationship between engine rpm and rate of fire as well as how the firing pulses were transmitted to the gun (essentially rendered semi-automatic) by the flex cable drive. Several presets let you view the schematic from various vantage points, with the important components labeled.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>If you like this, you might be interested in our Virtual Albatros Model Airplane Kit.</p>\n<p>And, if you <em>really</em>\u00a0like this, consider supporting Aircraft in Pixels on Patreon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:32:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e3f3b4ef2bf49091a98ac0e62b7d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bo Monroe"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
