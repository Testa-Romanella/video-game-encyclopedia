Players will have to understand what it's like to avoid health conditions that could arise from living in a place with such lack of gravity, conditions such as osteoporosis due to lack of physical motion because of the lack of gravity. Players will have to do repairs to fix issues that could arise from living in a place as perilous as the moon and do routine maintenance.<br/></p>\n<p>Team</p>\n<p>Jonathan Ramos - Team Lead/Programmer</p>\n<p>Jeremy Pineda -Programmer</p>\n<p>Shawn De La Cruz - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Savion Thomas - Designer</p>\n<p>Devin Davila - UI Artist</p>\n<p>Samantha Beigel - Artist</p>\n<p>Joseph Lewis - Shadow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b4713a5b1a2b8a80eb55360952689b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["savion210"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
