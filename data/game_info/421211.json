It's your friend's birthday tomorrow and you didn't buy them anything yet. Not only that but you've no idea what they actually want! You've hatched a cunning plan to take them shopping to a notorious flea market which has all manner of weird curiosities inside.</p>\n<p>Listen to what your friend talks about to see what their interests are and show them items to see what they like. Distract them by calling them to look at an item and then grab the gift you want to buy them without them looking! The more things you buy that they actually like, the more pleased they will be when you present your gifts to them at their birthday party.</p>\n<p>But watch out - take too long and the other shoppers will buy all the good stuff themselves!</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Origins</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Developed by Ed Kay (@edform)\u00a0with writing by Jerry Belich (@j3rrytron\u00a0)\u00a0during\u00a0Pirate Jam 2020\u00a0on the theme of\u00a0<strong>uncertainty.</strong></p>\n<p>If you'd like to try my last fully released game about swinging up mountains with a grappling hook and avoiding angry goats,\u00a0 you can find it at\u00a0www.hanglinegame.com. <br/></p>\n<p>Also you can\u00a0sign up to my newsletter here to get notified about new projects I'm working on.
