For some unknown reason you wake up the next day stranded in some island. You figure out that all this misfortune was caused by the vicious pirate lord that goes by the name of \"Little Fin\", so in order to get your treasures back you need to kill all his minions and face \"Little Fin\" himself at the end of the game.</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>Felipe Mendez / Programming</p>\n<p>Mauricio Alvarez / 3D Art</p>\n<p>Felipe Barber / 2D Art</p>\n<p>Daniel Escalante / Programming</p>\n<p>Gianluca Faccilongo / Music &amp; SFX</p>\n<p>Angelis Grohl / Game design &amp; Storytelling</p>\n\n<strong>SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS:</strong>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/lost-treasure-0</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/mr_croww/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/gianfacci/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/zombie.barber/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/3dmodeler.alvarez/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/nuigames/</p>\n<p>(In Progress..)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:04:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54298d707381c2e56ee920ce12ee55b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deadlycrow Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
