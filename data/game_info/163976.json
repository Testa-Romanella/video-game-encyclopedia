You'll be watching fastballs, curveballs, and sliders trying to make the right call.  Not actually a sitting simulator because you will have to make calls.  Use up to call a strike down to call a ball or click the buttons to make the calls.  Compatible with mouse, keyboard, or gamepads.</p>\n<p>This game features true to life fastballs and breaking balls at 74-104 mph.</p>\n<p>The first time you start it will walk you through a tutorial to learn about calling pitches.  If you already know the stike zone you can press escape to skip to the real game.</p>\n<p>The gifs are only at 30 fps, so it will be easier to see the pitches when you run the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99fe93b5a9bf2c08d883bc773bfc5b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beep2Bleep"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
