You can observe the two teams' match without any operation.<br/>\u25cf You can take over the AI at any time and perform full control over the team's players, such as dribbling, passing, shooting, tackle, or any teammate's running.<br/>\u25cf You can also set up formations, tactics and take effect in real time like a coach; you can also pause the game to make tactical-board-like arrangements.<br/>In general, this game is similar to the traditional Football Manager games, in addition, each player can be controlled in real time.<br/>For you, it is as if you are free to switch between coaching and player roles.------------------------------------- Features----------------------------------------<strong>\u25cf2018 World Cup </strong><br/>Contains the complete schedule of the 2018 World Cup 32 Finals.<br/>22 teams that have not yet reached the finals, including Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, and China, can also be selected to reach the final through a round of Wild Card games.<br/><strong>\u25cfClassic realistic style</strong><br/>3D stadium and players,  set the value according to the true proportion, player AI behavior and the game process as close to reality as possible.<br/>Basically complete football elements such as throw in, corner kick, offside, foul, free kick and penalty kick. There will be extra time and penalty shootout in the knockout stage!<br/><strong>\u25cfTeam Tactical Settings</strong><br/>Achieve the most basic and intuitive 10 tactical options, such as:<br/>-- Offensive/defense ratio<br/>-- Holding ball/Passing ratio<br/>- Short pass /Long  passing Tendency<br/>-- Shooting frequency<br/>-- The overall position baseline of the attack (or defense)<br/>-- Player spacing when defending<br/>Of course, template tactical options, such as [All-Out Attacks] and [Counter Attacks], can be set in one click.<br/>Tactical options are effective immediately after modification in the game, each option may change the style of the team.<br/>If you want to achieve the best tactical effect, you may need to observe and think and adjust many times like a coach.<br/>With more than 50 optional team formations and differences in player abilities, each game will have a lot of changes.<br/><br/><strong>\u25cfUnique and convenient operation method</strong><br/>Different from the traditional idea of  only controlling the ball holder, this game is based on controlling the whole team.<br/>There are two kinds of operation: fuzzy instruction and precise control: <br/><strong>-- Fuzzy instructions</strong>:<br/>Click on the four buttons at the bottom of the screen, as if the coach giving directions to the players:<br/>(When attacking) - Break through! Hurry pass! Take a shot!<br/>(When defensive)- Go chasing the ball!  Intercept his ball!  Slide Tackle!<br/>At this time, a player will be automatically selected, and he will execute the instructions according to his ability and team tactics.<br/>For example, if you press the [Tackle] button while defending, the nearest player close to the ball will begin tackle.<br/>Another example is that if you press the [Pass] key during an attack, the ball holder will automatically choose to pass a ball to a teammate in front of him. <br/>So this is an inaccurate command, and the effect may be beyond your expectations.<br/><strong>-- Precise control</strong>:<br/>By clicking and dragging directly on the field, you can accurately control passing and moving.<br/>Ball holder: Dribble according to the direction of dragging on the field; Click on the field to pass the ball to the click position .<br/>Teammates: Run according to the route of dragging; While in defense, clicking on the field will make one player to run to the click position.<br/>In this way, you can precisely control multiple players at the same time, so that you can organize attacks or defenses according to your own ideas.<br/>The following animation example shows a Dribble-Run-Pass cooperation between two teammates formed by two drag operations:<br/><br/>Of course, you can also use the keyboard arrow keys + buttons to complete the above control.<br/><br/>(For other game content and features, please see the Early Access  description)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for reading so much content!
