We are looking for some feedback right now so... we are hoping to hear some from ya!. Feel free to write here, on mail or in our in game questionare! :)</p>\n<p>And have fun in our short \"demo\"!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Mira\"</strong> is an adventure game inspired by Slavonic myths. It emphasises primarily the exploration of the presented world and the story of the title heroine, a nanny in an orphanage existing after World War II. The player, by moving along hand-painted boards and, owing to his interaction with that world, will become acquainted with new parts of the story. But not only: by his own decisions he will impact its end.</p>\n<p><strong><em>An oak forest, mossy paths, you're walking barefoot on the carpet of grass and moss. Sometimes you can hear a crack, a whisper, water dripping or the wind blowing. Little wildfires twinkle above the water. It is empty and quiet but you feel a tension. Meeting someone who has long known about your arrival is near. In the distance, above the trees, you can see familiar-looking castle towers. But there are more of them; some are different - you remember drawings from a museum. This world is different. You can feel it in the air, in the light, in earth vibrations. This is the primeval Navia's energy.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> </p>\n<p>website: http://en.miragame.pl/ </p>\n<p>facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Miragame-915561651847812/ </p>\n<p>twitter: https://twitter.com/miragamepl </p>\n<p>email: kontakt@miragame.pl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1bc881f79b95074b867d83170150274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["solfar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
