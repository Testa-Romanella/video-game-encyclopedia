{"id": 736460, "slug": "marble-maze-v2", "name": "Marble Maze V2", "name_original": "Marble Maze V2", "description": "<p>This game was created for Assignment 2 of CSUY 3113.\u00a0\u00a0The idea of the game is to play as a blue marble, and navigate through a maze of obstacles on a platform to reach the finish line (noted by a checkered floor). The levels each progress in difficulty as well as have some main obstacle and maze pathing. The ground floor also has no walls, so the player must stay on the path to reach the finish line. If the player falls off the map, they will simply respawn.\u00a0The color scheme was chosen to be minimalistic to provide clarity, as well as appear similar to the previous assignment.</p>\n<p>The spikes were created in Blender using their cone preset. I then created code for them that when touched, they would respawn the player back to the beginning. I considered instead that if you hit a certain spike further along the map, it would set you back to a checkpoint, however I ditched this idea because the levels were small and would maintain that little bit of frustration to keep it fun if any spike was hit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the third level, I thought it would be interesting to create some type of teleportation aspect. To do this, I created a small circle on\u00a0 the floor to which the player would teleport to the other one of the same color.\u00a0SPOILER AHEAD: I thought it would be funny to create a troll path, with a hidden game object that would kill you just as you thought you got to the finish line. I did this because I thought the people I shared this game with would be pranked and I would have a good laugh, but of course they predicted it and didn't fall for it (@Liam).\u00a0</p>\n<p>A previous version of this game exists on my Itch page, with the initial difficulty called Marble Maze V1. When I first made this game, I had the intention that my friends would play it, who are all very experienced gamers so I made it super hard to complete and very tedious. Most agreed that it was fun\u00a0 to complete\u00a0but also very frustrating/tilting (which I took as a job done right). However, after some consideration, I decided that it was best to keep the original design while lessening the difficulty for the submission of the project as well as demoing purposes.</p><p>(For those wanting more of a challenge, please checkout Marble Maze V1)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T04:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a2958e1a618bdbfb499e2c643b5d8f38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["juju136"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
