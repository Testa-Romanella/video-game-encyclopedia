A charming, enigmatic Irish butler, Paddly's origins began with a reclusive inventor who uncovered an ancient manuscript. Merging its contents into a computer program, Paddly was born.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Rapidly mastering the pong and pinball-inspired games, Paddly instinctively began serving up daily obstacles to challenge, entertain, and inspire players worldwide.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLearning is not attained by chance; it must be sought!\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>Paddly is an experiment by LZRBRD to demonstrate how principles of decentralisation might be applied to different aspects of a game with the goal of creating fresh, fun experiences. With this experiment we seek to shift focus of casual games away from proprietary data harvesting to open, fair, and player-centric experiences. We hope by doing so we prioritise a fun experience and open collaboration.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Let's learn together.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T16:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d1aef43981f2a8292b9b21f644c818.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PADDLY"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
