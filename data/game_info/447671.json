{"id": 447671, "slug": "101st-door", "name": "101st Door", "name_original": "101st Door", "description": "<p>This is a simple Platformer game made in Arcade Game Engine of python (I'm using python 3.7). This game was originally planned and was made for the 101 Hours Game Jam released earlier this year (End of April).</p>\n<p>The mapping of tiles and everything else\u00a0was done with Tiled\u00a0 Map Editorand used personally made graphics using Graphics Gale.</p>\n<p>Everything went well during creation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to an error in Arcade Library (which is apparently a famous\u00a0error in the said Library), I couldn't create an executable file for it. I was too late discovering this error as there's only 20 hours left on the 101 hours for the competition. So, in the end, I couldn't submit it.</p>\n<p>Now, I am sharing this game here for others to see, play, and learn from. Hope this works in my/your favor.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Make sure you have:</p>\n<p>1. python installed (at least python 3.5 and up)</p>\n<p>2. Arcade library (install by pip -&gt; pip install arcade) (FYI, pip comes preinstalled with python 3.7 version and up on windows so if you can't pip, upgrade your python to a higher version)</p>\n<p>3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file.</p>\n<p>4. Run the main.py file and enjoy the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS = Movement</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR = Jump</p>\n\n\n<p>AIM of the game is to completely traverse the whole map and completely conquer all doors. Leave a comment for questions and suggestions. Let the frustration explode!</p>\n<p>P.S.</p>\n<p>To those brave souls to conquer all 12 levels, please put up a screenshot of the LAST LEVEL if you can! I want to know if there's anybody who can complete the game. Also, NO CHEATING PLEASE!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9b86830074f057c72da05ffe718eaab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seraph Wedd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
