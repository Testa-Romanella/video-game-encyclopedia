{"id": 752088, "slug": "all-the-words-she-wrote", "name": "All the Words She Wrote", "name_original": "All the Words She Wrote", "description": "Takaoka Mayo is a twenty-four-year-old woman without any particular plans in life, nor any particular career goals. For several years, she\u2019s been drifting between low-paid part-time jobs, while living with her parents: her nagging mother and her kind-hearted father.<br/><br/>Mayo is unmotivated and lazy at the best of times, but she does have a passion: namely, Princess Luluna from the popular light novel series, The Forest of the Elves and the Pressured Princess, written by one Tsuchimi Rui.<br/><br/>Mayo\u2019s love for Princess Luluna is so great, her room is full of Elf Forest merchandise. Her walls are covered in posters of Luluna\u2019s smiling face, and she owns several Luluna figures, much to the bemusement of her best friend, Nina.<br/><br/>Despite Mayo\u2019s intense, borderline obsessive love for Elf Forest, she\u2019s content to pine after her fictional waifu from afar \u2013 that is, until one day, when a friend of her family\u2019s, Sae, offers Mayo an incredible job offer.<br/><br/>Sae works as a publisher at a company called Horizon, which \u2013 as it happens \u2013 is the very same company which publishes Tsuchimi Rui\u2019s Elf Forest.<br/><br/>Sae tells Mayo, to her disbelief, that she knows Elf Forest\u2019s elusive author personally \u2013 and, what\u2019s more, she\u2019s worried about them. Rui has been in something of a slump during the last few months, and the creation of Elf Forest\u2019s ninth volume has stalled. Sae is looking for a housekeeper to take care of Rui\u2019s chores, so Rui can focus exclusively on their writing: a job she decides to delegate to Mayo.<br/><br/>Mayo, of course, is overjoyed at the prospect of meeting her idol, and instantly accepts \u2013 but soon, she learns Tsuchimi Rui isn\u2019t at all like she imagined.<br/><br/>Contrary to Mayo\u2019s beliefs, Tsuchimi Rui is not a middle-aged man, but a young woman only a few years older than she is: a reclusive, awkward hermit who, despite being sub five feet tall, has a biting tongue and a needle-sharp personality.<br/><br/>This woman\u2019s real name is Komikado Hijiri \u2013 and, at Sae\u2019s behest, Mayo finds herself living under Hijiri\u2019s roof.<br/><br/>Mayo and Hijiri get off to an uneasy start, but as time passes, the pair begin to grow closer. Mayo begins to grow fond of Hijiri, yet still, she finds herself wondering: who is her real waifu? Princess Luluna, or the misanthropic author who created her?<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> 100,000 words of text (approx 4-6 hours of reading)<br/></li><li> A linear story with no choices/branches<br/></li><li> Detailed character and background artwork<br/></li><li> An original soundtrack<br/></li><li> One short, grumpy writer<br/></li><li> A cute lesbian love story<br/></li><li> A happy ending!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1fe36776f245ff5212f7cb3f6795cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ebi-hime"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["ebi-hime"], "esrb_rating": null}
