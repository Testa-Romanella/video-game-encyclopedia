{"id": 267857, "slug": "open-247", "name": "OPEN 24/7", "name_original": "OPEN 24/7", "description": "<p><strong>\"I'm so hungry right now, but there's nothing in the fridge.\u00a0 I wonder if there's any stores open at this time of night?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>its a game about walking through an old city at night. inspired by the times i walked through town at 3:01 am to get some cheesy puffs from the store.</p>\n<p>its not meant to be an actual game, with score or whatever. its just a small thing that you can invest your time into if you care enough. a man in black interviewed me about this game, and i will now put that \"confidential\" information right here.</p>\n<p><strong>HI:</strong> hi</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT WAS YOUR INSPIRATION:</strong> sometimes in late winter, i used to go out at ass-oclock at night and eat food at a convience store. my diet consisted of frozen mini pizzas, sugary diet cola, and cheesy puffs. The destination was pretty cool, but i loved being outside at night. have you ever been under a street lamp after dark? a must-do before you die.</p>\n<p><strong>ANY COOL MOTIVATIONS:</strong> not really. this was just a passion project that i worked since april.</p>\n<p><strong>DID YOU GET ANY FEEDBACK DURING DEVELOPMENT:</strong> oh all the time. i showed mostly my friends, and they played through every version of that game. most of the feedback was<br/>\"oh this is cool :)\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0but sometimes there was critique. ngl i wish they critqued it more. stop being such\u00a0supportive and good friends guys :(</p>\n<p><strong>WHATS WITH THE COLORS:</strong> i wanted a color that could mostly resemble night without using black. so i chose purple. so thats why its purple.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW LONG WAS THIS IN DEVELOPMENT: </strong>april 2018</p>\n<p><strong>DO YOU PLAN ON MAKING ANYTHING ELSE:</strong> eh.</p>\n<p><strong>ANY SECRETS IN THE GAME: </strong>a few. aside from the obvious one in the second area.</p>\n<p><strong>ANY FANART:</strong> some. ill link it at the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>WHERES THE MUSIC:</strong> the game works better without music. trust me. do you hear music when your walking around at night? no? then shut up. dumb. stupid question.</p>\n<p><strong>THIS IS JUST A WALKING SIMULATOR. WHERES THE GAMEPLAY. THIS IS BORING: </strong>u rite. but still, there are people out there that enjoy this sort of thing. me included. and tbh i wouldn't even consider this a \"game\" tbh. i've been treating this more like an art project.</p>\n<p><strong>ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE END RESULT:</strong> i mean kinda. i wanted to make a certain thing, and then i did. so i guess in that case im satisfied. did i succeed? probably. could i have done better? absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>DID YOU HAVE ANY HELP:</strong> no. i did all the art, dialouge, and tile placement. every creative choice in this game was mine.</p>\n<p><strong>DO YOU GO BY ANY PSUEDONYM? WHATS YOUR REAL NAME: </strong>i go by merch andise. unfortunatly thats my real-world name as well :(</p>\n<p><strong>HOW CAN I SUPPORT YOU:</strong> by leaving a nice comment. or a nasty one. just feedback tbh. im not doing this for money :/</p>\n<p><strong>ANY SHOUTOUTS: </strong>i was gonna shout out someone, but they decided to do some stupid stuff recently. so no shout-out for them.</p>\n<p><strong>WELL I LIKE THE GAME. I HOPE YOU DO WELL LATER IN LIFE:</strong> thanks. hope u do too guy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FANART SENT TO ME :) :0 :D</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Sip\" - SENT TO ME BY\u00a0http://astrokitty2.tumblr.com/</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>\":)\" - SENT BY\u00a0</strong>https://comical4u2.tumblr.com/</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>\"Unfinished\" - SENT BY anonymous</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46c304724e8e76ae2bc144e142640834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Merch Andise"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
