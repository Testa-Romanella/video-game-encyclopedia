Novosel, fleshing out the interior sketches!</li><li>$500 - Art by John W. Sheldon for the cover!</li><li>$750 - A recorded playthrough with Thomas A. Novosel!</li><li>$1000 - A Print-on-Demand code will be made available to those who have purchased to get an at-cost copy of the zine!</li><li>and if we reach $1200, John will do another art piece for us!</li></ul>\r\nI have added a number of rewards that I\u00a0think suit the project, including one-on-one games and portrait illustrations, but also community copies!Campaign ends March 15, 2021 at end of day Eastern time!\r\nWhat is The Man and The Stag?\r\n<p>A\u00a0game for two players where they tell stories and play out scenes about the unusual The Man who stays in their cabin in the woods and alone... except for The Stag from the copse who wants to influence the world of man with magic. Whether this connection leads to a revelation or condemnation does truly depend on the cards.</p>\n\r\nNecessities:\r\n<p>Two players</p>\n<p>One deck of cards, no Jokers, no Aces (shuffle once to start but then don\u2019t shuffle any cards unless instructed!)<br/>Paper (3+ sheets) &amp; pencils for a map, world characters list, and a timeline<br/>Script Change RPG Toolbox<br/>4-6 hours or two 3 hour sessions<br/><br/>Game design, some art, logo, and layout by Beau J\u00e1gr Sheldon and some art by Thomas Novosel (part of the crowdfund). Planned cover and layout support by John W. Sheldon.<br/></p>\r\nRisks\r\n<p>The game is basically written - it will go through an editing process and the layout will get tidied. This is primarily to fund art and pay for my already-invested time in playtesting and designing the game. While I am disabled and can be slowed down,\u00a0I've had three successful crowdfunds that I was a lead or co-lead on, and the remaining work is mostly on others who work more quickly and are more skilled than me. Using print on demand removes the need for shipping, etc., so my mobility shouldn't be an issue. I plan to use LuLu for PoD. Overall, this is a low risk project. You get a game that's fun to play, and more if we do well!\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nReviewers<p>Would you like to review The Man and The Stag? Email Beau at beau . j . sheldon at gmail dot com (remove spaces &amp; etc.) with the subject \"The Man and The Stag Review [Your Site Name]\"\u00a0for a comped copy. We'd love a review in the timeframe of the crowdfund, but understand the limitations.
