Aided with your trusty katana, the time manipulation drug Chronos and the rest of your assassin&#39;s arsenal, fight your way through a fractured city, and take back what&#39;s rightfully yours.<br />\nRun, sneak, walljump, grapple hook, roll, slash bullets, toss pottery, and slow down time to complete levels.<br />\nNo procedural generation. No backtracking. No metroidvania gimmicks or item collection. Every level is a unique and lovingly designed challenge to overcome.<br />\nA rich story filled with unique characters, all tied into the gameplay and level design.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T14:07:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d37/d37e110ddcc0bd52d99f0f647b737a0a.jpg", "website": "http://www.katanazero.com/", "rating": 4.41, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 206, "owned": 2117, "beaten": 1060, "toplay": 425, "dropped": 149, "playing": 65}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 1064, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1083, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Askiisoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Adult Swim Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
