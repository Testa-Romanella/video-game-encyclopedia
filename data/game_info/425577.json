My high score is 2500; perhaps you can beat it?</p>\n\n<p>I thought it would be fun to learn Unity during the vacation, but it turns out you can only do so much for a 48 hour game jam with zero prior experience with the engine and a shaky grasp of programming in general. The randomized levels, additional game modes, and zany effects turned out to be too much to handle in the space of a weekend; ultimately, I wasn't even able to include more than just the one level! The next one will go better, I think. For now I hope you get a little bit of enjoyment out of this little testing ground of mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e977fa58e66126830c9367ecffe4b934.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marshmellowT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
