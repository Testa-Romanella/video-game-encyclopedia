I learned a lot about using Godot to make games. I first started with\u00a0learning about the UI node and making a start menu. After that, I began making the small world and tileset for it. After that, I created the player and his collisions. Went straight to his movement code from there. Later I\u00a0tried to implement a finish line flag, but couldn't get it to work right. After learning how to make traps that reset the player, I applied that to a world boundary below the map. Finally, I went back to the finish line and coded it to send the player to the main menu. Overall, I\u00a0know it's not much of a game. I'm really just happy with how much I\u00a0learned trying to make it, and am looking forward to creating my own personal game in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c1e7a221436ad6d3051d555e9bbd006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flex"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
