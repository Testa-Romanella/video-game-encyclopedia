The goal was to take a classic game, add a feature, prototype it and create a whole technical documentation. I took the opportunity to make a weird arcade game. The goal is to use boomerangs to score, but in\u00a0tortured setting based on the Werter Opera, with a protogonist slowly falling into madness. From love to nightmare in 5 acts.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Marc-Antoine Archier: Music</p>\n<p>- Christophe Galati: design, programming, art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T02:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f4231c66d2f5a7da80891da0d9e5314d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisDeneos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
