It was originally launched by ITE Media in Denmark as Hugo Vulkan\u00f8en (&quot;Hugo: Volcanic&quot;) in January 1999, and was promptly licensed and broadcast in many other countries.[1]</p>\n<p>In this scenario, the friendly troll Hugo&#39;s the arch-enemy, the evil witch Scylla (Afskylia in the original Danish version), has moved to a jungle island, where she teamed up with the local tyrant Don Croco. Scylla then once again kidnapped Hugo&#39;s wife Hugolina and the children but this time she keeps them captive in a cage in her new lair, located at a top of volcano in the center of the island. The player controls Hugo, aided by the monkey Jean Paul and the toucan Ferdinand, as he needs to complete a series minigames (&quot;hugocopter&quot;, ostrich jockey ride, liana climbing, volcano lava chase, etc.) to reach and defeat the witch and free his family.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T10:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cbbb36d3ce66981c725a75d04671643.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interactive Television Entertainment", "ITE Media"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["ITE Media", "Interactive Television Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
