Only FIGHT!</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to control, escape to exit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Die a Hero would have been made as part of the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge, if timing had been better. Instead it was made as a personal project started some weeks before the challenge, and finished on March 27, 2021. The game was made in Processing. Credits to kenney.nl for initial sprites, which were later scaled up and redrawn and/or replaced. Game is provided as is. Support is not guaranteed, and no updates are planned. It is published under a Pay What You Want model, in case you want to leave a tip for itch.io, but payment is 100% optional.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/7926a96c4f99f56359f665c8939759a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["carnalizer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
