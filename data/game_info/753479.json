The idea was that you would clean a dirty mansion and instead of monsters, you would encounter dirt, grime, cobwebs etc that increased daily. Being a clumsy idiot, you would have to watch out because failing an attack roll would mean destroying things like vases, etc.</p>\n<p>After about 6 days of development, code was becoming too difficult to manage, and to do something as simple as creating a monster, it had to be added in 3 different places. Unfortunately, the gameplay is very minimal.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD / Arrows / Numpad: Move</li><li>Q: Spawn 20-50 critters</li><li>E: Spawn 1 critter</li><li>R: Reroll stats</li><li>C: Close door (or window)</li></ul>\n<p>Bump into critters to \"shoo\" (attack) them away from the manor! There is no win condition but you might set a personal goal to remove all the critters (except one :&gt;)</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>\n<p>All the code is released under the GPL v 3.0.
