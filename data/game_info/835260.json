Ghosts and demons are a common threat. While the poor struggle to defend themselves against the demonic, the rich can simply afford to hire someone to take care of any problems for them.</p>\n<p>You were hired to clear out a billionaire's mansion. In order to waste as little money as possible, you have been given only a spirit box to help you. If you are successful, your family will be able to survive for the next week. If you aren't, your family will starve and someone else will be hired to replace you.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Spirit Box is a horror game made for Wowie Jam 4. The ghost and demons that threaten you are almost always invisible, so you'll need to use your spirit box to locate them. You can ask your spirit box multiple questions, and the answers you get will be crucial to your survival.
