You can jump from a rocket to a destruction ball, to a futuristic racing car. The game is still very early in development so only a part of the content is downloadable/playable. All levels have been unlocked for playtesting purposes but in the final version of the game, you'll have to unlock levels by finishing the previous. XtremAthlon is a game inspired by <strong>Mirror's Edge</strong>, <strong>Mario Odyssey</strong> as well as <strong>Portal</strong>, even though this inspiration is less understandable this early in development.<br/></p>\n<p>You can message me if you want to talk about the game, I'll be happy to answer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87a/87acf2ffc449427f0f5ce5c0d5c4cb3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sagaan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
