The theme of the jam was Mythology. We have chosen David vs Goliath, where a simple shepherd with only a sling was able to defeat an armored giant (Goliath).</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Move David to the battle area (on the right) using WASD keys. When a \"Quick Reaction\" event is triggered, just select quickly the required keyboard button. There is a first demo of that when going close to the pillar at the entrance of the battle area. The quick reaction event is to dodge Goliath attacks and after a few attack he becomes tired and then David will attack automatically.</p>\n<p>Press Alt-F4 to close the game.</p>\n<p>Game developed using Unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Developer:\u00a0https://devwilliamhardy.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Graphics Artist:\u00a0lazanja.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Sound Artist:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/tolemak84</p>\n<p>Developer:\u00a0kamaleon70 - itch.io</p>\n<p>Free Megascans from Quixel</p>\n<p>Free Base Mesh from Daz3D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a85/a8507a32b08bd6940f0d6a16c716dd50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazanja", "William Hardy", "kamaleon70", "Tolemak84"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
