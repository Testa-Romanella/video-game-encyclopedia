We were given the task to create a simple but effective game that teaches students the basics of what DNA replication consists of which is what we've done with our game \"DNA Replication\".\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The player is tasked with running through a simulation of what it is like to replicate DNA using the two main polymers that are involved in the process of DNA replication including Helicase (The Unzipper) and Polymerase (The Builder). This is done by controlling the player with the WASD keys and using the mouse left click to drop off the polymers at the correct locations on the DNA strand. Once dropped of in the correct location the DNA replication process is automated to give players a visual representation of what goes on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/158d687cccd87dfcd8cad2c599adcbab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fklau", "awoodrow"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
