The goal is to find the best solution to create an algorithm that takes these robots into victory capsules.<br/><br/>In this videogame, the player is introduced into a 3d world filled with levels where the main objective is to help one or more robots to reach the capsules by assigning commands or actions (such as to forward, to turn, to jump, and others) that are logically programmable and iconographic, the latter to facilitate the understanding and learning of the player.
