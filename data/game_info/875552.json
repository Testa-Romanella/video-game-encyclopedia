{"id": 875552, "slug": "oga-gallery-escape", "name": "OGA Gallery Escape", "name_original": "OGA Gallery Escape", "description": "<p>You dosed off in the OpenGameArt Gallery and woke up to find the door locked. You know the drill...</p>\n<p>This is a short escape game made for OpenGameArt Fall Jam for the theme gourds. OpenGameArt/OGA is a site where anyone can\u00a0share open source game assets. I have no affiliation with the site beyond a small user account. This was just a fun way to fit the jam requirements of using OGA assets while spotlighting some of my favorite assets from the site.</p>\n<p>I had a busy schedule and a long bout of writer's block, so I did not start on this game until the last few days of the jam and threw it together a lot quicker than most of my escape games. I had been wanting to try something different with my escape games and\u00a0since I was short on time, I decided to experiment with an inventoryless game with everything\u00a0set up to be unlocked by combinations or buttons as opposed to items. Here's hoping this system ended up with the right level of challenge without being impossible or glitchy :)</p><p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p><p>Point and click room template</p>\n<p>Modifications were made</p><p>Author: crazyduckgames</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/point-and-click-room-template</p>\n<p>Old wood frame</p>\n<p>Creator:Charles CFandM</p>\n<p>http://www.publicdomainfiles.com/show_file.php?id=13965495025609</p>\n<p>Doors</p>\n<p>Author: SpiderDave</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/doors</p>\n<p>Asian Mountain Forest BG</p>\n<p>Author: Crisisworks</p>\n<p>Source game: https://evilartbunny.itch.io/spirit-of-the-wind</p>\n<p>OGA: https://opengameart.org/content/asian-mountain-forest-bg</p>\n<p>Oil painting landscape Cold Mountain</p>\n<p>Author: JAP</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/oil-painting-landscapes</p>\n<p>Mountain at Dusk Background</p>\n<p>Author: ansimuz</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background</p>\n<p>LPC: Interior Castle Tiles</p>\n<p>Author: Sharm (Lanea Zimmerman)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-interior-castle-tiles</p>\n<p>Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC) Base Assets (sprites &amp; map tiles)</p>\n<p>Submitted by bart, created by Leana \"Sharm\" Zimmerman and Stephen \"Redshrike\" Challener.
