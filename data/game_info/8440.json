It is also an interactive poem, and a slow-paced experience in ambient delight. Explore a world, and enjoy the sights and sounds of it as you do.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Meadowland you take the role of a faerie, and you are free to explore the world as you see fit, in any pace you deem necessary. As you explore the landscape you will come across magic, secrets, people, and hopefully, a purpose. The point of the game is relax and enjoy the experience provided.
