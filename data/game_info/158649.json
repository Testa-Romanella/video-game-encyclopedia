You are on a search for food and water when the area around you starts to shake and rumble. Searching for the source you notice a rock, pointy and sharp had risen out of the earth. Being curious you go over to the the rock and investigate. Before you could get even 3 feet in front of it it attacks!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>find a way to escape!</p><p>Controls</p><p>Space to Jump</p><p>Development Process</p><p>I wanted to make a side scrolling game that transitions after a couple of seconds as you have to avoid hazards. The wolf was an idea from a friend that suggested i make a runner for animals out in the wild. I wanted to take out the realism and use rocks instead of a predator for a more fantasy feel.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>SinWeaver for wolf Sprite</p>\n<p>https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/sins-little-bit-of-everything.4...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/6326e3f69ea03bfe45fce067cf03cb46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["CryoC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
