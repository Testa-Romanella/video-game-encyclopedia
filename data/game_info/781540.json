{"id": 781540, "slug": "anyway-itch-coffox", "name": "Anyway (itch) (Coffox)", "name_original": "Anyway (itch) (Coffox)", "description": "<p>\"Anyway\" is a detective\u00a0<strong>text quest</strong> where you are welcome to become a high-technological robot dog whose main task is to help an actual detective to solve the case. What tasks are there beside the main one? That's up to you!</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so\u00a0<strong>what is there to know about the game</strong>?<br/></p>\n<ul><li>You play as a <strong>robot dog</strong> with a wide range of different tools to aid your partner in the investigation. For example, you can read the emotions of a person as they are speaking and later catch them on concealing something from the detective!</li><li>Still you weren't exactly designed to lead an investigation on your own so get ready to rely on your <strong>human partner</strong>. Good thing is that he is an ultimate specialist. Bad thing is that his character balances out his professionalism (and not in a nice way).</li><li>Lock down in a dystopian high block! You get lots of shops and few people, leave alone that one of them is a killer running free... <strong>tension is growing</strong> and by the end of the night people won't act the same way.</li><li><strong>Learn the story</strong>\u00a0of both the house and its residents. Maybe it will help you to scratch the surface of the secrets lying in these walls... or maybe you'll just get somebody to call you a \"friend\" and throw a frisbee?</li><li><strong>Beware of your own secret</strong>. Act careless and you may as well not see the sunrise... which, perhaps, can be better than other options.\u00a0</li><li>Even robots can <strong>have fun!</strong> Explore the house, play with the residents, mop the floor... see what you can do and try it all!</li></ul>\n<p>Currently the game is in the \"proof of concept\" stage and takes from\u00a0<strong>15 to 25 minutes</strong>\u00a0to play. Our team will decide whether to continue the development or not based on your feedback and ratings so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section!</p>\n<p>Almost all the key mechanics and characters are already present in game and waiting for you. :)</p>\n\n<p>OFFLINE version includes everything from the version you see here, it just allows you to play with no Internet connection.</p>\n<p>TEXT version has no images so it can be run on potato computer (just kidding but if you try please tell us in the comments how it went) and\u00a0doesn't take much space. Enjoy the ride!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08c599eb90a8fd8f1a85a289faf747b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Coffox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
