The goal is to remove all of your friend's pieces. The game unfolds in two phases, the\u00a0<em>Drop Phase</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>Move Phase</em>. In the drop phase you and your friend take turns placing your 12 pieces onto the board. Then in the move phase, you take turns moving your pieces to try and form three-in-a-row, which allows you to remove one of your friend's pieces.<br/><br/>Like chess, it's a game of complete information and *pure skill. If you're not that into defeating an opponent through superior strategy, then this game is not for you.
