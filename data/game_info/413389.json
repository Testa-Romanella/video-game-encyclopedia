Unfortunately, their spaceship was cut in half in an accident. Separated on the two parts of the ship, their mission is to keep the ship running for as long as possible, repairing consoles, extinguishing fires, and keeping the flower safe and hydrated.</p>\n<p>Going Home is a short 2-player coop game about making quick and efficient decisions to manage your time and the gradual degradation of the ship.<br/>Teamwork is essential, as tools are limited, and players will need to pass them around in zero gravity.</p>\n<p>Two players are required to play<br/>You can play with either a keyboard and a controler, or two controlers.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made under 48 hours as part of the 2020 Global Game Jam, with the theme \"Repair\". I made it alone for the most part, but I got some last minute help on floor and walls sprites, and most importantly, for the whole music. So thanks a lot Tanguy \"Last\" Perreux, Pierrick \"Aozo\" Charbonnier and Florian Texier for their valuable help!</p>\n<p>This version is slightly different than the one uploaded at the end of the jam, because i fixed a few minor bugs, and made it so that the difficulty actually increased over time rather than being constantly tough. <br/></p>\n<p>The first version is still available here:<br/></p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/going-home-3</p>\n\n<p>Inputs :<br/>KEYBOARD (P1)<br/></p>\n<p>- WASD or ZQSD\u00a0 to move <br/>- \"E\" to pick or drop an item<br/>- \"F\" to use the held item<br/>- Hold \"Space\" to prepare a throw, release to throw your held item</p>\n<p>KEYBOARD (P2)</p>\n<p>- Arrow keys\u00a0 to move<br/>- Numpad \"1\" to pick or drop an item <br/>- Numpad \"2\" to use the held item <br/>- Hold Numpad \"3\" to prepare a throw, release to throw your held item<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLER (XBOX, should be compatible with PS4 controlers aswell, but not tested)<br/>- Left stick to move around<br/>- \"A\" to pick or drop an item<br/>- \"X\" to use the held item<br/>- hold \"Y\" to prepare a throw, release \"Y\" to actually throw it</p>\n<p>The game is lost when the flower completely withers.<br/>Use the wrench on broken consoles to repair them<br/>Use the extinguisher to put out fires that come out of broken consoles<br/>Fill the watercan on the fountain, then use it on the flower to keep it hydrated</p>\n<p>There is no actual win condition, you need to survive for as long as possible<br/>Good luck, and enjoy :)</p>\n\n<p>PS: I have no plans on continuing developping this prototype further, but let me know if you catch any bugs so I can fix them!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/2542ee3341f5ff2e5159656a3811818c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scaelin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
