The main character is a clever illustrator caught up a series of murders at Kiersau Abbey over twenty five years. This character alone possesses the wits and will to expose the killers, but each decision he makes has lasting consequences and inexorably draws him closer to the center of an underlying conspiracy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T19:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f1d/f1d25c007b9b45c98b57ff9ebbca9692.jpg", "website": "https://pentiment.obsidian.net/", "rating": 4.23, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 74, "owned": 444, "beaten": 90, "toplay": 143, "dropped": 36, "playing": 21}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 106, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation 5", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Obsidian Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Xbox Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
