The theme for this jam was to make a game where jumping is the core mechanic. I decided to make a platformer where you can only move unless you are jumping or falling. You control the jump height by setting your jump power. W or Up arrow to increase and S or Down arrow to decrease. A and S or Left arrow and Right arrow\u00a0moves you in the air and Space is jump. You have hit points that you will lose if you hit platforms or the ground too hard. You also can run out of fuel depending on your jump power and the number of jumps you make. You can collect fuel to fill your meter back up. I only did one level as I\u00a0was unable to spend the amount of time I\u00a0wanted on the game during this jam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T09:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/339e8fa97efed933baca75fc865e01fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bondreal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
