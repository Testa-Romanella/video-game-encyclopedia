The townspeople are nice, though, and maybe reincarnating as a fisherman isnt all that bad.<br/></p>\n<p>And so begins his new life.</p>\n\n<p>Fishing Isekai is a grindy fishing simulator with life sim elements, made in a few weeks for IGMC 2022. It currently includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Custom pixel graphics</li><li>Fishing minigame with 15 catchable fish</li><li>An encyclopedia to catalogue your catches</li><li>6 romanceable characters (male and female)</li><li>2 unromanceable characters</li><li>No endings or storyline, just chill fishing and wooing love interests.</li><li>A dogboy with an adopted sea bunny daughter i really like him</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game is not quite in a finished state. I struggled a lot with motivation during the jam period, and I do think it's a miracle that I'm even able to submit something that's slightly presentable. Whether or not I'll fix it up in the future is in the hands of fate at the moment.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a few issues with the game at the moment, notably that text is sometimes too big for the text box by a few pixels. I've opted not to fix this for the jam release, as I've made sure the text is still readable. And the cow sprite looks bad, i've never drawn a cow before, do you know how hard it is to draw a cow. Do you.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you find any bugs or issues, and constructive feedback is welcome.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Art, eventing, concept, story : 65pts (with color palette by PineappleOnPizza)<br/>Music : Leonardo Paz<br/>Sound Effects: PanicPumpkin<br/>Plugins : CasperGaming, Masked, Shaz, Hime, Galv<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:56:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b352dfaacfc202b1f817da0549a7c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["65pts"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
