I quickly had the idea for a game where you control raw ingredients to a cake, and this game was the result of that idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The surprise limitation was that only two buttons were allowed to be used. For this game, the entire game is played with the left and right mouse buttons. The Esc key is also used to exit the game, but I didn't think that would count.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did most of the art, however, here are the credits for what I didn't do:</p>\n<p>Water textures:\u00a0https://rapidpunches.itch.io</p>\n<p>Wood Tiles: https://shubibubi.itch.io</p>\n<p>Music: https://xdeviruchi.itch.io</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: https://bellblitzking.itch.io</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e21da0e80f46a24dc1bcea87ac22fc47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chrygore"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
