It is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards and is closely related to other trick-taking games like Spades, Euchre, Whist, and Bridge.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score the least amount of points. You earn points for every heart you take, and if you are unlucky enough to get the Queen of Spades, then you are stuck with an extra 13 points. Maintain the lowest score to win.<br/><br/>HEARTS TERMINOLOGY<br/><br/>\u2022 Hand: The cards held by one player<br/>\u2022 Passing: Before each round, each player will pass three cards to another player. The direction of the cards passed will change each round<br/>\u2022 Trick: One card played from each player forms the trick<br/>\u2022 First Trick: Must be led by the two of Clubs; all penalty cards cannot be played on the first trick. This includes Hearts and the Queen of Spades<br/>\u2022 Trick Winner: The player with the highest value card of the led suit collects each trick<br/>\u2022 Following Suit: Players must follow the suit of the first card played in each trick, if possible<br/>\u2022 Breaking Hearts: Hearts cannot lead a trick until a Heart has been discarded on a trick<br/>\u2022 Discarding Cards: Players can discard any card if they are unable to play a card of the led suit<br/>\u2022 Voiding a Suit: When a player no longer has any cards of a specific suit, that suit is considered voided.
