A player will have to roll a 6 before he or she is able to navigate a colored piece from its starting point to the starting square. After that, in each of the subsequent turns the player navigates a piece forward for one to six squares as indicated by the dice roll.<br/><br/>When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player has to forfeit his/her turn which then passes to the next player. <br/><br/>In cases where the player has rolled a six, the player may also choose to separate the chances if both pieces are active. For example, he or she can navigate one piece by 6 houses and another piece by 4 houses. Conversely, both the chances can be played using one single piece only; i.e. the player may navigate one piece for 6+4=10 houses.<br/><br/>Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be re-entered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. A player's home column squares are always safe.<br/><br/>When a piece has navigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home pocket by an exact roll. The first player to move all 4 pieces into the home pocket wins.<br/><br/><br/>Get ready for the crazy adventure Ludo All Star is going to take you to, with it\u2019s best ever in-game features.<br/><br/>Download Ludo All Star now!
