{"id": 325828, "slug": "rot-zzle", "name": "Rot-zzle", "name_original": "Rot-zzle", "description": "<p><strong>Rot-zzle</strong> is an action packed single player puzzle game which requires the player to move and turn their puzzle piece while aligning themselves with the corresponding piece and rotation. Snap the pieces together and build the complete puzzle to win! Touching an incorrect piece or the correct piece at the wrong angle will induce a penalty and cause a number of pieces to disintegrate and get shuffled back into the fold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made by <strong>Jason Peterson</strong>, <strong>Nolan Sadowski</strong>, and <strong>Dan Weber</strong>. Unfortunately we couldn't utilize the whole time of the event because we had work and various other life things going on at the same time.</p>\n<p>This was made specifically\u00a0\u00a0for the <strong>Extra Credits Game Jam #4</strong> and the theme was <strong>\u201cConnect\u201d</strong>.
