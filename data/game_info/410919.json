{"id": 410919, "slug": "twenty-minutes-too-early", "name": "Twenty Minutes Too Early", "name_original": "Twenty Minutes Too Early", "description": "<p>\"Twenty Minutes Too Early\" is a choose your own adventure game where every choice you make changes how the story progresses. The player wields a time traversal device that has the power to bring the player to multiple different times in the past encountering classic historical figures as well as a few you wouldn't expect. When you get to your destination the TD breaks and you must find a way to repair it potentially putting yourself in harms way to do it. The goal of this type of game is to make choices based on what you'd do in that situation not what you think you should do. Have fun and don't take the game too seriously!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d60288e0f795354e5ea067d4b3fe0afa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nathan.Raia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
