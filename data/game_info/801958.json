I based some of the design decisions on my experience playing EverQuest back in the day.<br/></p>\n<p>Super early prototype where I'm mostly testing combat scripts for my cyberpunk RPG.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Short term development goals:</p>\n<ul><li>Add functional Friends and Guild list that act as \"save slots\" for the random players generated on the Who list each session. Even some of the players you meet but don't add to friends will stick around and be persistent NPCs you interact with.</li><li>Add leveling (for sure) and loot (maybe) as rewards for grinding mobs. As you progress in levels, you'll need to travel to the next zone or next camp as your XP gains fall off from being over leveled.</li><li>Add idle features both for active play (e.g. you could assign someone else in your group to pull and then just sit back and AFK, watching your party do the work) or offline play (based on your reputation with your party, they'll let you AFK soak XP for a while and you'll get those rewards next time you play).</li><li>Add skills/spells - I created some design space in my head for this, but I this part of game design I find more tedious, so I end up putting placeholders in (e.g. the Firebreath spell from the Dragonborn Guards).</li><li>Add true role functionality and allow the party leader to set party composition. Healers will heal as long as certain triggers are met and tanks will do their best to hold aggro. I currently track each mob's personal aggro table, so I'd like to show that, as well.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Long term development goals:</p>\n<ul><li>Implement the various specialty stats you can see on the Who list. These are for special raid bosses where, like in a management sim, you aren't directly controlling your guildmates in combat. Rather, you're assigning people with high leadership skills to be party leaders to improve performance, or if there is a critical mechanic, having someone with good boss mechanics memory able to cover. Funneling gear to your best dps with highest class mastery, but maybe another key player is greedy and will leave the raid if their item level falls too far behind.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T10:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/575/5750989812be42a612fb9271416da5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Board Golem"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
