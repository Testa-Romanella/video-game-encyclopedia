You will play the game against randomized characters with randomly rolled dice. You can choose a two-person game or a four-person game. Try to last as long as you can. You can try to bluff your way to victory or call your opponent a \"liar\" if you think he is bluffing. The loser of the round has to drink a round. Beware, for the more you drink, the harder the game gets. Who will end up under the table, you or your opponent?<br/><br/>Made by Alex Gyzlov, Brendan Halstead, and Cy Pabis for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T15:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/252/252a185e9203a921c4b99d22219b58dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustAGuyNamedCy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
