Our 3rd LD around, I think we finally got the hang of scope.<strong> Hope you like the game, and don't forget to share your scores!</strong></p>\n<p>Civilization has given us many wonders, but it has deprived us of some of the simpler joys. This game is a throwback to the good old days of shepherding, when you didn't have to worry about anything but the grass under your feet and the sun on your face. Oh yes, and the sheep. The kind, caring, sensitive, wise, compassionate sheep, that do nothing but run around eating things that poison them. Those sheep. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the harmonies of the Symphony of Baahs.</p>\n<p>P.S. Please try to keep the sheep away from those scary-looking bushes. <strong>You may find your cattleprod (LMB) and your fences (RMB) useful.</strong><br/>Good luck, and may the force be with ewe.</p>\n<p>(Run SheepWrangler.exe to play the game)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a0835bebb373184e1670d0479dec3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elmo's Minion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
