The core gameplay consists of pushing and pulling cubes on a 3x3 grid made of similar cubes. The grid map is randomly generated at the beginning of each round. The cubes come in three different colors (red, blue, and green) and white. <br/><br/>The objective is to earn enough points to beat a high score by positioning\u00a0 similar colored cubes to adjacent spaces (diagonal positions don't count) on the map. This will trigger the set of\u00a0matching colored cubes to explode and earn you points for each one destroyed (a multiplier is added if more than two cubes are destroyed at once). <br/></p>\n<p>An\u00a0 explosion can have a significant impact on the map - transforming it to varying degrees. Especially if a chain reaction of explosions are triggered. White cubes are the only ones that don't explode when they're placed next to each other. <br/><br/>Be careful not to fall off the map. Be aware of falling cubes because they can kill you, as well as the spikes located on the ceiling. If you let the cubes pile to high on top of each other you will most likely \u00a0touch them and die as well.</p>\n<p>If you have an extra minute, I would really appreciate if you can fill out this quick survey about your play session: https://tinyurl.com/mrrpsrnk<br/></p>\n<p>Otherwise feel free to leave your honest feedback in the comments section below : )</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>***DISCLAIMER ABOUT GRAB MECHANIC BUG ***</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The grab mechanic can be wonky at times. I found that sometimes the grabbing a cube can sometime behave funny. Sometimes you won't be able to  move, or the camera will reposition itself in a weird angle that make it both difficult to move and see what's around the avatar. If this occurs, <strong>just release the grab button, move the camera around, and grab the cube again. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p><strong>(***XBOX GAMEPAD ONLY**)</strong></p>\n<p>Left Joystick - Move\u00a0Player</p>\n<p>Press Left Joystick - Sprint</p>\n<p>A - Jump</p>\n<p>B - Dodgeroll</p>\n<p>RB-\u00a0Climb</p>\n<p>RT - Push/Pull Cubes</p>\n<p>Right\u00a0Joystick - Rotate Camera</p>\n<p>Back Button - Return to Main Menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f582a8e764e7530537b4db2f19de91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["galloping_bull"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
