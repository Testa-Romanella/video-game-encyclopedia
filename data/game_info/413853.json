Deciding he\u2019d rather be doing literally anything else, Lucas begins scouring the school in search of a mysterious wind up toy he saw break through a classroom window. Join Lucas as he roams the halls of his high school after hours, and encounter a wide variety of eccentric individuals: some are friends, most are foes, and all are kind of idiots. Expect turn based combat, blunt dialogue, and a lot of arbitrary reasons to kick some people in the shins.</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>JRPG Turn Based Combat</li><li>No more than three additional party members</li><li>Naughty words</li><li>Approximately 45 minutes of gameplay</li><li>Occasional Need to Strategize</li><li>Bad Hairdos</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is my first attempt at a game which involves a fair amount of balancing and mechanic tweaking, so if you have any questions, problems,\u00a0or suggestions feel free to comment or email me!</p>\n\n<p>Plugins Used:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0KockaAdmiralac\u2019s Follow Up Skills</li><li>Galv\u2019s Message Sound Effects</li><li>Himeworks\u2019 Enemy Reinforcements</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Core Engine</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Message Core</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Battle Engine Core</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Battle Status Window</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T05:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31dbe6f0cd1dfc89326021fb982bd7c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
