I took me 9 months to make it. I do not know how to drescribe it.It is very abstract. I try to convey meaning through colors. In fact, the first name of the game was going to be \"Follow the Scpectrum\". However, it only has three colors. Thus, I decided to call it differently. </p><p>There is no Load option. So be careful. <br/></p><p>  Anyhow, I made it free so that everyone can enjoy. Feel free to comment and critique.However, feel free to support me any way possible. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9b44f180913eaa9d2787f61dd1014be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corintoluli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
