I'm a developer and the game as almost no code, so most of the effort were on everything else. It forced me to learn camera, design and UI skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge achieved</strong> : Extra Meme (Beach Ball) /\u00a0Extra Switcheroo (somehow)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and thanks</strong> : Free3d.com for the chairs, Google image for the ugly sweater, UltimateGameMusicCollection (assetstore) for the intro music, and special thanks to the community on Discord!</p>\n<p><strong>Team of one</strong> : Hito on Discord, I play with unity on weekends for 3 years now, this is my first Jam. I'm a web developer for 14 years, I've found out making games could be as fun as playing them.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements </strong>: The game could definitely use better assets, and other way of mixing kids, like hats, faces, shapes\u2026 A better sound design would also be a huge plus. It makes me want to make the next jam in a team.</p>\n<p><strong>OpenSource </strong>: I will upload the source of the game which I commented, maybe it will help. Anyway, I like to code thinking I could be judge by others, this force me to excellence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7c89b212e14ce49c03e571f5ab8b50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Edejour"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
