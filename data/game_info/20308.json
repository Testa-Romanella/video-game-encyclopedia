Each weapon has its own pros and cons as well as <strong>three different, separate basic attacks - and a special attack</strong> to finish off your target (or weaken someone else) once you have successfully hit enough with basic attacks. Smack them from behind and push them into lava or spikes for extra damage: let the beards hit the lava in a slow-mo gorey flight!<br/><br/>Just brawl - it's a party!Dwarven Brawl Bros is a brawler that <strong>doesn't limit your gameplay to class spesific skills or weapons</strong>. All the characters can use all the weapons and you can change your style and arsenal mid-fight: each dwarf can carry up to three weapons, replacable on-the-fly. The brawling is made <strong>non-restricting and insanely fun</strong>!<br/><br/>Spice it up!If you enjoy specific gameplay, like playing as a zombie or a fake-elf versus dwarves, there are game modes for that too. Matches can also be customized with different gameplay settings, such as setting hit points and special attack unlock damage.<br/><br/>On top of that, stages are destructible, making individual bricks break and platform structures collapse by the weapon hits, projectiles, and explosions.<br/><br/>Couch-friendly party game<strong>Just sit back, grab gamepads and beverages: this is a perfect party game to play with your friends (or foes).</strong> Team up and go co-op, or fight alone against others!<br/><br/>Dwarven Brawl Brosis fully controller supported, meaning that it can be played through the menus and the gameplay with a controller.
