Entrusted with the elemental cards, can you prevent the destruction of all London?</p>\n<p>Cardolon is a turn-based card game featuring strategy elements, where you must prevent the destruction of London using the four elemental cards (listed below). Rather than earning a score as the game goes along, you start off with as high a score as you can ever get. At the start, all tiles are worth 100 points. As a tile burns or is destroyed in some other manner, it's worth slowly decreases. At the start of each turn, it is possible for a special event to occur, such as a dragon attack or the river flooding.</p>\n<ul><li>Fire - Burn a group of tiles, preventing fire from spreading there</li><li>Water - Put out the fire in a group of tiles</li><li>Earth - Build a wall, entirely blocking the fire's path.</li><li>Wind - Change the wind direction, impacting the fire's spread.
