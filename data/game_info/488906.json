Bring a new apple to the box. New apples grow on one of the three trees around you.</p>\n<p>- If a duck is well fed, it falls asleep. Bring it to the resting zone.<br/></p>\n\n<p>A small game for Haunted PS1 Summer Of Screams.</p>\n<p>It's a game about feeding monster ducklings. If there is no food... you become the food!!!</p>\n<p>The spoopiness in this one is lagging a bit though. I hope you enjoy it anyway :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game does not yet have a propper ending, because I\u00a0had to finish it in a very small amout of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the mouse sensitivity feels off for some reason, I reccomend downloading the standalone build. There seems to be a weird bug with the mouse sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>Game Design by Marcus Horn and Ronaldo Bammann</p>\n<p>Music: Pet Park by\u00a0https://www.playonloop.com/<br/></p>\n\n<p>One last thing: Please be aware, that you should never feed whole apples to ducks. :) Apples need to be cut into pieces first, and you need to make sure there are no seeds left in the apple.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b23db74e4731cbc33155658baa589ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Siactro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
