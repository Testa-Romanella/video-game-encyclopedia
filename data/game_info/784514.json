Since the original game was already entirely black and white it looks\u00a0surprisingly faithful to the original.</p>\n<p>The controls and gameplay are\u00a0quite straightforward, without any instructions even young children will rapidly understand the rules, but it takes quite a while to master. As in the original, the shooter angle rotates automatically back and forth but if you choose to pop on the Playdate crank you can also dial in a precision shot.\u00a0 \u00a0If you're\u00a0 Playdate console hasn't yet arrived\u00a0you can\u00a0totally play this on the\u00a0Playdate SDK Simulator\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>The game itself is quite small (1.7MB\u00a0including original sound and music). Additionally the\u00a0complete source code is also available on Github\u00a0so feel free to play around and see how it works.\u00a0 Please note, this release is not affiliated with Wouter Visser (the original author)\u00a0and is just a tribute to one of the\u00a0greatest game ever made.
