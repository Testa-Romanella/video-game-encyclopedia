You thought that you need the entire crew to drive such a vehicle? Then you were right.<br/>But not in this game! You have to switch between seats inside the tank in order to win. It is not a super realistic simulator but a casual game based on historical equipment. Put your multitasking to the test by trying to complete the tasks of up to 5 crew members just by yourself. Simultaneously drive, navigate, aim, load and look around - and most importantly - survive!<br/>There is also a two-player co-op mode.<h3> Choose ammunition! </h3><h3> Blow up your opponents! </h3><br/><br/>Achieve victory in four different tanks on dedicated maps:<h3> Sd.
