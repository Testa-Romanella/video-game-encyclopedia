{"id": 256763, "slug": "doctor-slime", "name": "Doctor Slime", "name_original": "Doctor Slime", "description": "<p>This is my entry for the 10 event / 1 map challenge. The game, which is only slightly more than a narrative, is a spoof of Doctor Strange with a few re-imagined characters as slimes. Don't expect an epic journey, or a massive story in multiple parts. The actual purpose of this title is just to provide the player with a chuckle. In fact, it is so small that combat would likely have gotten in the way of the short little narrative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To fall under the fair use clause for a parody the following must be stated: I make no claim of ownership of the source material (Doctor Strange); furthermore, this derivative work is meant to be both free and a compliment to the source material. Finally, any likeness to persons real or fictional outside the scope of the parody is purely coincidental.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>Features:\u00a0\r\n<p>Play as a Slime! Play as a slime with a\u00a0HAT! There are not many other features to speak of, but this short narrative should be fully functional. The game uses several plugins, and a nifty common event that allows plumbing to be used for navigation. The game has only one real purpose, to provide the player with a few laughs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babde97ccf3f572c8ec01a8357f4cb6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Failsauce GameWorks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
