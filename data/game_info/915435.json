The course contains almost all of my recoverable previously made assets that were made for games both released and never finished.\u00a0Select from a variety of right off the bat available skins for you to try out and navigate your way through the course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>Drag to shoot. Slingshot style. <em>(May implement drag to shoot in the same direction if requested)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fun facts:</strong><br/>Cuboidal Control 2\u00a0is the successor to Cuboidal Control which was made for the annual GMTK game jam in 2022. This project was also used as a school submission where one must upload a web application that uses AWS integration. Obviously, I treaded on thin wire here with submitting a WebGL build of a unity game but I got the approval of the teachers. This is also my first game that features a skin changer</p>\n\n<p>This game may receive some updates if the developer isn't so fucking lazy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T08:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c37/c378b8fd01cf19e984e010589a39b04e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UnscriptedLogic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
