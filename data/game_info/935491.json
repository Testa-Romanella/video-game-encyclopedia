Instead, they see through a drone flying overhead, a canon reason for the top-down perspective. This idea lead to a challenge where if you are unable to see yourself, you start to lose your sense of self, and therefore lose the game. You are tasked with downloading information from a far away source, only possible by staying there for long enough. To succeed, its not a difficult puzzle to figure out how to utilize the zoom well, it's just very tight timing.<br/></p>\n<p>In honor of the creator of the clone, Bennet Foddy himself is the win condition. I'll have you figure that out yourself.<br/><br/>#CONTROLS:<br/>WASD to move; SHIFT to toggle camera\u00a0\"decouple\"; X and R to zoom in and out;\u00a0\u00a0E to speak and ENTER to continue speaking. (Making it the same key broke things ):)\u00a0</p>\n<p>#CHANGES?<br/>Honestly, its a pretty tough challenge, but I was able to do it consistently enough that I kinda felt bad making it easier.\u00a0and I wish I made it more dramatic when you experience ego death.<br/><br/>#CREDITS<br/>The fantastic music is curtesy of K3BK, a chiptune cover artist who I asked permission to use the tracks. The songs featured are his covers of Polyphia's \"Paradise\" and \"Ego Death\" (fitting).
