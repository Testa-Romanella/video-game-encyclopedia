Using his ability to project his soul and warp to its location, The Thinker must master puzzles of motion, patience, and precision.</p>\n<p>I built this game over a period of several months while working on Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Though it is technically completable, I was not satisfied with I Seem To Be A Rock and didn\u2019t have the time to truly finish it. I submitted it to the IGF in 2011, but only released it publicly in 2014 (so you can consider it somewhere between done and cancelled). Feel free to read a post-mortem and/or dev diary on its making\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Click to fire out your soul in the direction of the mouse cursor. Click a second time to teleport to your soul\u2019s location. You can right click to cancel a shot without teleporting.</p>\n<p>Hit space bar to bring up an in-game menu if you want to quit or restart a level. Restarting is especially useful if you\u2019re trying to master a level, as dying does not reset your shot count.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll let you figure out how the obstacles in the game work, this is a journey of discovery, after all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/1215ca7d70913a86e14b44b03fc4d376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Zuhn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
