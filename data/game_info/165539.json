Occasionally combat, but mainly just the serenity and solitude of space.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0used to load up Eve Online at work at just have it sit there on a second screen with my mining ship sitting in an asteroid field somewhere just drilling away. Eve Online isn't really a very serene place though, with someone always coming along to cause trouble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game gives you that safe place in space to call your own, where the only danger is being able fall into self-reflection.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Next?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is certainly playable as a clicker game, but there are still plenty of things to do.
