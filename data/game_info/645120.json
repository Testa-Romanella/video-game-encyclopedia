One day he goes outside to pick from<br/>his banana trees only to be levitated up from the ground and abducted by egg aliens.<br/>Filled with rage and egg hatred he must make his way through floor after floor of the<br/>mothership. Blasting egg aliens and spilling their yolk all over the walls in this endless<br/>sidescrolling shoot-em-up roguelike! This game was made in 9 days for the Newgrounds<br/>July Jam hosted by @Figburn. We had a lot of fun developing the game and are really happy<br/>with the end product!</p>\n<p>PLAY ON NEWGROUNDS!</p>\n<strong>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>CONTROL SCHEME 1:\r\n</li><li><strong>Up</strong> - <em>Aim Upwards</em>\n</li><li><strong>Down</strong> - <em>Aim Downwards</em>\n</li><li><strong>Left </strong>- <em>Move Left, Aim Left</em>\n</li><li><strong>Right </strong> - <em>Move Right, Aim Right</em>\n</li><li><strong>Z </strong>- <em>Jump, Confirm</em>\n</li><li><strong>X </strong>- <em>Shoot, Cancel</em>\n</li><li><strong>X + Down</strong> - <em>Interact</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li>CONTROL SCHEME 2:\r\n</li><li><strong>W</strong> - <em>Aim Upwards</em>\n</li><li><strong>S</strong> - <em>Aim Downwards</em>\n</li><li><strong>A</strong> - <em>Move Left, Aim Left</em>\n</li><li><strong>D</strong> - <em>Move Right, Aim Right</em>\n</li><li><strong>K</strong> - <em>Jump, Confirm</em>\n</li><li><strong>L</strong> - <em>Shoot, Cancel</em>\n</li><li><strong>L + S</strong> - <em>Interact</em></li></ul>\n<p>Arrow key layout is recommended and the game is intended to be played this way.\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD was an afterthought, hence why the UI shows the arrow key layout.</p>\n<strong><strong>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></strong>\n<p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\"The game runs slow!\"</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>If the game is running slow, check to see if 'Hardware Acceleration' is enabled on your Browser. Chrome has been booting with it disabled recently, for some reason. You can also turn on 'low-spec mode' in the options, or just downloading the game.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\"Will the game be updated?\"</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>There is a two week judging period, so we aren't allowed to add anything to the game until that is over. We've got a big list of things that didn't get added to the game and we might squeeze a couple of those in after the judging period is over! Cross ya fingers! &lt;3</p>\n<strong><strong>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></strong>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>SlickRamen (Programmer) : Twitter | Newgrounds | Itch.io<br/>POSTBOY (Artist) : Twitter | Newgrounds | Youtube<br/>Dieswyx (Music) : Twitter | Newgrounds | Bandcamp<br/>Stepford (Programmer) : Twitter | Newgrounds | Itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T05:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/769/769a4f605cd1915936082caba74275b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stepford", "SlickRamen"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
