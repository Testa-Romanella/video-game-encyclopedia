The theme was Internet and the Limitation was Everything must die in one hit. The game\u00a0ended up being way less polished then i would have wished for, so sorry for that. The game plays a bit like Tetris, there are blocks falling down and you have to arrange them to create a binary code that is equal to the decimal number shown on the right of the \"playingfield\".\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>PS: There may be still be some bugs in the game but they shouldn't make the game unplayable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T04:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e93/e93aea3b61ed9880b2f67c5b19ec09f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cowgummiboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
