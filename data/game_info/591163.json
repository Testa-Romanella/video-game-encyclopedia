E.g. if one of them requires digging and the other doesn't, the bait will be ignored and the first one will be selected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f29087a89f976614919bf62c93e524b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holy Black Cat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
