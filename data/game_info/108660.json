At first the player is overwhelmed and confused (as I'm sure you would be if you were suddenly plonked in my shoes and expected to handle my life) but soon after their fifth game I notice a shift in the attitude of people at the controls of SS100: they stop seeing the game as an unmanageable mess, and start seeing it through a steely gaze of concentration and determination.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey enter a trance-like state. Their actions are automatic.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game introduces the simple tasks to you one-by-one, and before you know it you're managing more than you ever thought you could, but are still doomed to fail.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSystem status 100 is a metaphor for how busy my life gets at this time of year, and how woefully unprepared I am for it.</p>\n<p>\n<em><br/>\n</em></p>\r\n\r\n\t\"It's a wonderful and horrible game of trying to concentrate on more things than you can reasonably concentrate on, and trying to recover from mistakes.\"<br/>                                                   -Alice O'Connor, Rock Paper Shotgun<br/><br/>\n<em>\"@_jrap gives us control of every game, all at once.
