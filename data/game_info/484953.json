Just touch it, you don't need for headbutting<br/></li><li> Run in place to receive point multipliers!<br/></li><li> If you want to switch out an exercise during play double tap the new exercise twice in the exercise selector to your right.</li></ul>The optimal time to hit the cues is when the marker that rotates around the cue touches the second one.<br/><br/>Upon start you will see several different blocks. Touch one of them at the desired difficulty spot to select a level and difficulty. To disable exercises switch them on/off with the switches to your left.<br/><br/>Exiting a stage during play: On the top of the left blue pole is a sign to exit a stage.<br/><br/>Play with your own music in Freeplay mode* Put on some music in the background (maybe using the nullnMusic player) and hit the blue drum in the main menu to the beat of the music.
