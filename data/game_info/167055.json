It cannot be defined by just one's gender, race, creed, nor nationality.  That is one of the reason that I am using Ball People in this game.  You cannot tell if someone is a bully by what they look like.</p><p>In this game you will find that characters use compliments, friendly jokes, and praising instead of attacking.  When successful, the bully gets closer to being a friend.  The bullies attack through insulting and some may try to reduce willpower.  Characters have Will Power (WP) instead of hitpoints (HP).</p><p>Come join Ballden, as he collects Friendship Tokens and converts bullies into friends, so that his friends Shellie and Limeon can help him face the Bully Boss.</p><p>This game attempts to implement 'Tru 2D', where there is no depth dimension.  The 4-sided die that is 'rolled', and is viewed in dialogue box is an exception to this concept.</p><p>Note: If there is a demand for MacOS version, I will depoy it, and make it available.</p><p><strong>Available Games:</strong></p><p>A Ball People Winterfest </p><p><strong>Ballden Facing Bullies Board Game Adventure</strong> </p><p><strong>Finding Hope Board Game Adventure</strong> </p><p><strong>Fun Vision Park Board Game</strong> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f81/f81c4d7a7a3889f8dee6781301cf6aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MinisterJay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
