At its core, It's a 2D arena fighter where combining elements can save or take away lives. You can knock someone off the stage or just blast them away with a rock outright. There are spells that you can use to defend yourself as well!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have some unique characters that change the properties of the spells based on their affiliation to an element. For example, Jamal turns all his earth and fire spells into lava spells. These spells mostly stick to the ground instead of flying through the air.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/257d262c4ddd068fb27b6fd249cfb749.jpg", "website": "http://sundrydstudios.com/cast/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sun Dryd Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sun Dryd Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
