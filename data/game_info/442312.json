The goal of the assignment was to create a game of a different genre using the Unity Roguelike tutorial assets. Students had to reuse the assets to produce a game in a genre that was not roguelike, while also developing a feature that was not of the chosen genre. For my assignment, I went with developing a Tower Defence game using the assets, the feature that is not prevalent in the Tower Defence genre that I developed was the ability for the user to gamble the in-game currency. The project I developed has 5 playable levels, all of which lead on from each prior level and are available after a minimum level is reached. Students had the choice to develop the UI using our own\u00a0assets, I went with minimalist colours;\u00a0like the Battlefield 1 Menu UI, and a retro game font. The name 'Rogue-You-Like, derives from a mispronunciation of Roguelike, I believed this mistake to be comical and decided to make that the name of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0The largest influence for the game was Bloons TD, with being one of the most popular tower defence games. For the last level of the game, it was supposed to mimic Warcraft 3 Tower Defence, where the user has a clean world to build towers; giving the ability to build the path the enemies make. This was planned to be implemented but ultimately was not.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38efb044456b0b6d4b5ebe1124af35b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flapjackiechan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
