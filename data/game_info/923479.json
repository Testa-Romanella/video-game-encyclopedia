The game is short because it only has three levels. The character picks up three powers, one of them is the meteor strike, this is used by jumping once and while in the air pressing the ''X'' key near enemys. The game comes with a ''README'' file where there is more information. Good Luck!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Requirements: windows, 2ghz processor and 256mb graphics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca4e704355417120cc0d26ea17a5646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FranX"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
