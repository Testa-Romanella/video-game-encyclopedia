People started playing it and making youtube videos, some of which racked up over a million views over night. We had not anticipated this type of response and feel incredibly fortunate and grateful.</p>\n<p>We now want to iron out all the kinks, expand on the game's feature set and rework parts of the game design to ultimately release a fully featured version of the game.</p>\n<p>Check out a Let's Play video...</p>\n<p>In order to receive the funding to continue development, we have created a crowd funding page for the game. The game will always remain a free download but we would like to allow fans to support development so that we can build new features and release updated versions in the future.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support us, please head over to http://pledge.barbershopsimulator.com and help us out. Ever bit is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a294a21a09f09a56e39c8865643a42cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shavetastic"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
