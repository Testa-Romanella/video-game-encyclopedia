His main task is to get to his ship, which is many kilometers away. You will have to show considerable skill to help him reach his goal. On your way you will meet strong opponents with whom you will have to fight. The game has parkour, as well as triple jumps and, of course, our main character is well armed with his galactic shotgun, which throws energy balls at the enemy.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Music by Teion<br/></li><li>graphic by Jikkol<br/></li><li>exciting adventures</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T06:00:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2446fda945d22e52c706a861f676f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Realgame"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["khukhrovr"], "esrb_rating": null}
