{"id": 838874, "slug": "bernard-sleepingpanda", "name": "Bernard (SleepingPanda)", "name_original": "Bernard (SleepingPanda)", "description": "<p>You play <strong>Bernard</strong>, <strong>a naked hermit crab</strong>, lost in a polluted sea where waste can be used as shells.</p>\n<p>Solve puzzles, avoid obstacles, and guide Bernard to his beloved crab family.</p>\n<p>This game was made for LowRezJam 2022, and has been done in 15 days during my free time (approximately 2-3 hours per day).</p>\n<p>I didn't really got enough time to complete my 30 levels goal, but debugged a lot instead. You might still find some glitches here and there. I'll probably update the game with bugfixes and additional levels later after the jam voting period.</p>\n<p>I went to Bretagne (France) this summer for two weeks and watching hermit crabs on the beach gave me this game idea. Hermit crab is translated to \"Bernard l'hermite\" in French so yes that's why I named this game \"Bernard\". ^^</p>\n<p>Ratings &amp; feedbacks are very much appreciated as usual!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Thank you for passing by and I hope you have fun.</p>\n<p>Oh, please..\u00a0<strong>Post a screenshot of the ending screen with\u00a0your favorite shell.. \ud83e\udd2d \u2665</strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u2014 Antoine, aka SleepingPanda\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard (QWERTY)</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJump\r\n\t\t\tSpacebar, Up arrow key, or W\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStop moving\r\n\t\t\tS, or Down arrow key (release key to move again)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRestart current level\r\n\t\t\tR\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<p>Keyboard (AZERTY)</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJump\r\n\t\t\tSpacebar, Up arrow key, or Z\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStop moving\r\n\t\t\tS, or Down arrow key (release key to move again)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRestart current level\r\n\t\t\tR\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<p>Gamepad</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJump\r\n\t\t\tA, or B\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStop moving\r\n\t\t\tDirection pad down (release key to move again)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRestart current level\r\n\t\t\tSelect/Back/View button\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<p>Mouse</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJump\r\n\t\t\tDouble left click\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStop moving\r\n\t\t\tHold left click (release to move again)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRestart current level\r\n\t\t\tR keyboard key\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<p>Touch screen</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJump\r\n\t\t\tDouble tap anywhere on screen\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tStop moving\r\n\t\t\tTap anywhere on screen and hold (release to move again)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRestart current level\r\n\t\t\t<em>Not possible yet</em>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Code, &amp; Art: Antoine Gu\u00e9d\u00e8s,\u00a0@__sleepingpanda</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX: Mickael Blum,\u00a0@BlumMickael\r\n</p>\n<p>Font: Chunky Monkey, by\u00a0@damienguard\r\n</p>\n<p>Color Palette: SuperFuture25, by @ENDESGA</p>\n<p>Tools:\u00a0Construct 3,\u00a0Aseprite, and\u00a0Famitracker</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653ffbcd5c61c1ab5474b6b30ede5394.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SleepingPanda"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
