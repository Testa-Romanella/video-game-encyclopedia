From the perspective of Ed Malayo, the aforementioned cafe's senior barista, that's the most interesting thing to happen in months! Join Ed and his coworkers as they brew up some drinks, scout for new employees, and not do a whole lot much else.</p>\n<p>This game is, admittedly, not much of a game. The mechanics are underdeveloped, and the entire thing can be completed without ever figuring them out.\u00a0It is also nowhere near a complete narrative. It\u2019s very short, and it kind of just ends out of the blue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More than anything, this project is a test of mechanics and ideas whose existence will make the eventual creation of a final, complete game easier. So if anything seems out of place, inconsistent, or superfluous, it probably is.</p>\n<p>Either way, please enjoy this small snippet in the continuing story of La Piovosita, the Italian Cafe!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee81d8d24c1c0f2443697ff228fd457b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
