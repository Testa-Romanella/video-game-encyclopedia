Each scene presents a new challenge which must be completed to unlock access to the next lift. These challenges are tailored to fit with the theme of each scene, and can range from shooting targets, escaping enemies, and solving puzzles. There are a total of four playable levels thus far, and I plan on adding more in future releases.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eaeac06eccafff2d6fbdb71cc0db6164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamerbog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
