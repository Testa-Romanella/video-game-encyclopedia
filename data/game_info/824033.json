Unlike normal enemies, they do not drift off the map and will continue to pursue your ship until they succeed or are destroyed. Minibosses are much more difficult to take down and are\u00a0rumored to carry\u00a0an unknown power source. More data is needed.</p>\r\nSHIP SYSTEMS\r\n<p>You can level up your ship by collecting XP loot from enemies to add new systems and increase their power.

There's a chance it will pop up every time you level up. When activated, your trusty Drill bot\u00a0will begin following your ship around. If you are within range of an asteroid, the Drill will automatically mine the asteroid until it breaks to reveal materials.</p>\n<p>Gather materials to purchase higher level (3+) S-GEAR from the shop. You can increase your cargo size with the Cargo upgrade\u00a0so you can carry even more. The normal max is a 25 material limit per mission without a Cargo upgrade.</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<ol><li>Watch out for\u00a0opportunities to damage minibosses while moving around<br/>\n</li><li>Choose damaging upgrades to gain an early advantage<br/>\n</li><li>Focus on enemies you can destroy in one hit to maximize XP<br/>\n</li><li>You will\u00a0need to slow down fast-moving asteroids to mine them<br/>\n</li><li>Zippers\u00a0have a chance to drop really\u00a0rare items</li></ol>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Art, music, design, and programming by maigi.</p>\n<p>This game was made using the\u00a0Kaboom\u00a0JavaScript library.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>maigigames.com<br/><strong>Find us on social media:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T11:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41bb69c1c830d76861737eef93d0fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maigi Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
