She might still be out there somewhere. Thankfully, you have a way to find out. Explore two routes and six different endings to the story!</p>\n<p>This is a short narrative horror game about a missing sister, creepy mermaids, and a really, really deep lake. Made in 72 hours for Minijam 109: Depths, with the special limitation \"health as a tool\". Music, art, and scripting is all by me. There will probably be some typos and other issues due to the time limitation. Feel free to leave a comment if you find anything!\u00a0I will add a downloadable build after the jam is over and I have time to do a proper proofread.</p>\n<p>Wave sounds from Noted451 on Freesound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Noted451/sounds/531015/</p>\n<p>Music made with Beepbox\u00a0https://www.beepbox.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee79d7fb2e9d3976d7d4d163e7745da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nightsparrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
