Exiting back to the main menu and restarting the game fixes the issues.**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T04:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/28216cd49f0940bc8aa398ac2c29398f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mortis Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
