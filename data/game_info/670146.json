Merciless giant bosses will challenge the hero and must be defeated in order for him to reach the conclusion of his difficult journey. Powerful weapons are accessible since the very beginning of the game with more and more of them becoming available as the story progresses. 'Netherprime' can be collected from opponents defeated to enhance the various aspects of the prototype 'Netherpiercer' spaceship, allowing for greatly varied upgrades experimentation after every single boss vanquished. The game features random enemy swarm formation making every single playthrough different than the last one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T05:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a668b4997fb57bfca48d15bd23b2a4b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["althael27"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
