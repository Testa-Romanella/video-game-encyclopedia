What are you waiting for? Come on and start rockin' the raceways!</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>12 different characters!</li><li>3 unique tracks!</li><li>Singleplayer (vs. AI) and online multiplayer!</li><li>Retro look and feel!</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use your mouse to navigate the menus. Default car controls are WASD and spacebar (for handbrake).\u00a0R to put your car back on the track (in case you get stuck).</p>\r\nHave fun!\r\n<p>Feel free to post LFP (looking for player)\u00a0comments down below. Please share any videos as well, I'd love to see them!</p>\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE\r\n<p><strong>I'm using the free version of Photon networking which means only 20 people can be playing concurrently (i.e. at the same time) in MULTIPLAYER.
