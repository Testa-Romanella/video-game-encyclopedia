If you don't like this art style and give up, I totally understand.</p>\n<p>I worked alone in this game, so this game could have some bugs that I haven't discovered. If you guys find any, just leave a comment below or send an email to me at\u00a0here. I will try my best to fix it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong><br/>In this game, the gameplay is simple, the storyline is common, the art style is retro, but <strong>to collect the full list of achievements requires logical thinking, trail, and sometimes creativity.</strong></p>\n<p>I will upload a full achievement guide later (maybe after one week), but for everyone who unlocks all achievements in this game before the official guide, you can have the opportunity to play my next game one week earlier than others. I am currently developing another 3D adventure game with my friend for my thesis project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876cde63e38ad9bd5ebcfbecd1eab620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jingyi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
