Your enemies want it back.</p>\n<p>Your mission is to navigate dangerous terrain and rescue as many civilians from the area as possible and deliver them to various checkpoints.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will\u00a0utilize your overwhelming firepower against your adversaries, which are numerous. Combat uses classic turn-based roguelike mechanics, so positioning the direction of\u00a0both your tank and your weapon will be critical.</p>\n<p>If you linger too long in one area, you are bound to be targeted by aircraft - best to keep moving and save as many as you can.

I am using first and foremost the amazing rot.js library, and have forked the engine and other elements from\u00a0 my existing in-development game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/043a0c6f2aba53d9fe09703310591daf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["heroicfisticuffs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
