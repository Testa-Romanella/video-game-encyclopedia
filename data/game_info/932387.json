Now you've found it\u2014but is that a good thing?\u00a0It's\u00a0adrift, with no signs of life. You're a smuggler, and the code in the <em>Achilles</em>' engine could be your biggest score ever. But what if whatever killed the crew of the <em>Achilles</em> targets you next?</p>\n<p>This is a\u00a0Twine mystery/horror game set on a seemingly abandoned starship. It should take about 1 to 2 hours to complete, and has a few different possible paths and endings. While it's a text game, it's designed to mimic a classic adventure game, with a map, an inventory, and an environment you can wander around freely, plus a few not-too-difficult puzzles.</p>\n<p>Note: Clicking on the arrow in the top left right off will display the map, which will be very helpful in navigating the game. This game can be played on a phone, but works better on a tablet or a desktop as that leaves more room for the map.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Warning: This game has mature themes involving violence, murder, and the afterlife, and is also intended to be somewhat creepy at parts.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T16:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c2dd45404528e87b6ccecc27c9d8cbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["davidesky2"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
