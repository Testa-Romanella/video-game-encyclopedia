Fill toys into like-colored boxes to score points. Mismatching colors or trying to put a toy in an already filled box will count against you. Rack up enough errors and it's Game Over. Consecutive fills without an error will result in an impressive combo Streak that further multiplies your score.</p><p>In addition to Normal Mode, there is Perfect Mode, where you must continue on without allowing a single error. Listen to two different wintery tunes and choose from 3 different starting difficulties.</p><p>Use the stylus to slide toys up, down, left, and right. Tap the chute button to send the lowest toy down into the present box waiting below on the conveyor belt. Press Start (or just close the lid) to pause the game.</p><p>Built for the DrunkenCoders.com Third Annual Christmas Game Coding Competition.
