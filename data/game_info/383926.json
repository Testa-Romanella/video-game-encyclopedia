The jam theme was \"One for all, all for one\" and we incorporated the theme by making the game centered around your two weapons, the \"Gun for All\" which does low damage in a large radius, and the \"All for Gun\" which charges up its damage by killing small enemies with the Gun for All, and is used to take out the larger enemies. Every aspect of the game was developed in a 48 hour period, and the build has not been touched since it was submitted for the jam. Controls with keyboard and mouse or a PS4 controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T04:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/43158fdf13996bc0dddc0516a0ea56d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrendorTheEndor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
