You can walk on the walls and ceiling (the areas where you can do this are tinted black) but if you stay up there for too long you will run out of magnetism, so you need to collect magnet packs i spread across the arena. And the only place you can get health is the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0A few minor details, the revolver is a 1 hit ko but takes a while to reload, the rifle can reload quick but takes more effort to kill an enemy and the shotgun never has to reload but is only viable at close range. I forgot to remove this but you can right click on a magnetizable surface (indicated by the crosshair spinning or it being tinted black) to flip to it.</p>\n<p>I'm going to include a credits.txt sort of thing in the zip folder so if your interested in the creator of the music or what i used to piece together the sounds\u00a0check that out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T02:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d37c9cf1f0af1b007a3f703a6853fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AceRed"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
