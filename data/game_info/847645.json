In each area find hidden keys and bulkhead wheels to progress. Attempt to complete the game within the time-limit for your selected difficulty setting.<br/><br/>Uses one CC0 photo from Pixel, a photo of one painting by my wife (Bee Kenner) done before the jam and several audio files from zapsplat.com. Otherwise models are self-made in blender with procedural materials and using some textures from unreal starter content. This is an Army of One entry, with everything made by myself with the above exceptions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T16:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/1983dbddad186a6933e5c35420be9afd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mkenner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
