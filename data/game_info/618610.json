This is my first time using PuzzleScript, and I really like it!</p>\n\n<p>New features include:</p>\n<p>Sticky blocks- blue crates that stick to each other but will separate when put under stress.</p>\n<p>Swapping blocks- purple crates that will swap positions with you when you push them.</p>\n<p>Mimic blocks- pink crates that move with your player.</p>\n<p>Holes- your player cannot pass through these tiles. However, pushing any crate onto one will fill it in and turn it back into a ground tile.</p>\n<p>Gates- yellow walls that allow your player to pass over them, but will stop crates from moving through.</p>\n<p>Other than that, all of the normal Sokoban rules apply- move your player and push all of the\u00a0crates onto the goals, and walls\u00a0stop your movement.</p>\n<p>This game has 20 levels. See if you can make it through them all! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81b/81b6299a201320a7de2c26ecd2abada6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MegaProgramGuy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
