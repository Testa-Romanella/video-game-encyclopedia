Would rather it not be voted on if possible. Thank you for understanding)</p>\n<p>Living Death is currently a short branching horror adventure, originally built for the Pixel Horror Jam held July 1 to October 31 2017 . \u00a0It currently has:</p>\n<ul><li>One \"guide\" (was going to have two; will re-implement the other later)</li><li>A total of 3 maps</li><li>at least 2 good endings (maybe more depending your opinion on \"good\" and \"bad\")</li><li>3 \"bad\" endings (this is more due to the fact that I don't feel I have the time to implement all the story I wan to; will come back later and expand on all these)</li><li>Hopefully minimal jump scares (I can't stand them, and I'm sure others are sick of them too)\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>I'm not sure if I have to put this or not, but it has themes of isolation, and there's very minor violence (nothing is shown, just heavily implied)\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Pixel Horror Jam logo in-game isn't technically the right one but that's because I didn't realize that they'd changed the logo and I recently bought a new computer that's having a bit of a problem working with my removable hard drive (which is where I store my RPG Maker Projects) If I manage to transfer the project over okay I'll fix the logo, but for the time being I'm leaving it due to concerns of not wanting to corrupt the game files.\u00a0</p><p>Update: Made a really quick fix to enable saving (I think the script I was using didn't like the fact that I was trying to separately call the save and load screens so it broke) not sure how to deal with the lag in the menu, though.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b3ba0e281a1234b6a3c754e8f2b8e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lemongreen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
