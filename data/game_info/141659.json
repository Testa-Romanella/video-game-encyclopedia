Well I decided to say \u00a0competitive roll-a-ball tutorial. For those who do not know Unity, a very popular game engine, has a set of tutorials, one of those being the roll-a-ball tutorial the most simple tutorial unity has to offer, the concept is simple you move a ball around and collect points until you win. Well my friend asked how that was even supposed to work, and so I explained to him how it would work and the concept was born.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 I wanted to keep the concept simple like the roll-a-ball tutorial and also I wanted to keep it very pure like the roll-a-ball tutorial and so from the very beginning I decided that there will be no way to directly affect the other player(except pushing them of course) the only want to win is by picking up power ups.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 the game took 8 days on and off to make and this my project I ever put effort into. However, I am aware that in the state it is now it is bad. I will probably never charged money for the base game no \u00a0matter how far it gets in development. this is meant to be a learning experience for me and I hope to get a lot of feedback, I encourage you to call out my game for missing, bad, or broken features by contacting me in any way you see fit and I will hopefully fix it in the next build(which should come out on a schedule I am thinking every two weeks ). I will try to keep you informed on all new progressions or ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few notes when playing that I should probably convey more clearly in the base game:the drop-down under the game section of the options menu is used to manage which way to control the player 1 or the purple sphere(either by keyboard \"wasd\" or controller) also the top left player, player 2 or the red sphere(either by keyboard \"ijkl\" or controller) .</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for taking time to read this and enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c278eea8de1cf58ca8557fa7fbcbc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rieou"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
