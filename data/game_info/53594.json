Like the much earlier Super Robot Wars Gaiden, the game features no licensed mecha or characters at all - instead, it uses only Banpresto&#39;s own creations, in an original story. The games sold well in Japan, and later adapted for a short animated OVA called Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Animation, which takes place after the second game in the series. A television series, Super Robot Wars Original Generation: Divine Wars, retells the story of the first game. Original Generation was released in the United States on August 8, 2006. It is the first game in the Super Robot Wars series to ever be commercially released overseas, since, unlike the rest of the series, it contains no characters from other media, therefore, no legal entanglements were involved in a foreign release.<br />\nA sequel, Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2, was available on February 3, 2005 in Japan and was released in North America on November 21, 2006. On June 27, 2007, Super Robot Wars: Original Generations, an enhanced remake of both Original Generation games, was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T07:06:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d34/d34853b4f14debc1734a74584bc63d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 27, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Banpresto"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["505 Games", "Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
