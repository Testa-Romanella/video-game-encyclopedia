And welcome to one of my first big projects: ArtHeist, developed via the course \"Videogame Development in Unreal Engine with C++\" from the company Arkde.</p>\n<p>In this game, you will take control of one of the most famous robbers of the world. Your objective? To infiltrate the renowned art museum and retrieve a very rare statue located in the main hall. However! The museum security won't make it easy for you. Watch out for guards, spherical robots that explode when they are near you and landmines that instantly kill you!</p>\n<p>Lastly,\u00a0 it's important to give credit when credit is due. So in the following link you can see the credits for some of the assets used in this game:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOl6dUmXZjmG2v3U0kzZ__Trpjq4SU4o5mGsR7mzj64/...</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a prototype, not a fully developed game.
