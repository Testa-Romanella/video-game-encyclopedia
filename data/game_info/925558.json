The town lives with minigolf, and folks all around the town love the game. Unfortunately, a reserve of oil was found underneath the town. A rich oil magnate wants to transform the lovely minigolf town into an oil city. The townsfolk are angry about it, and to stop the oil magnate, they will use what they know the best - minigolf.</p>\r\nGolf Town\r\n<p>The town itself was founded a long time ago and ever since has been a symbol of peace and calm to any visitor. The people of the town were always peaceful and caring. Since the city residents discovered a game known as minigolf, everything else seems to freeze in time. Everybody stopped to be interested in all the wild west stuff and started to play minigolf. The town seemingly thrived from all the minigolf tournaments and events until the age of the oil mining boom. Since then, many oil magnates started offering vast amounts of money to the town's residents to buy out the land for oil mining, and the town's mood and willingness to play minigolf deteriorated. Everybody is just waiting until someone accepts one of the generous offers, and there won't be anywhere to play minigolf.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Detailed world design with two separate interior scenes</li><li>Meaningful dialogues (implemented custom dialogue graphs)</li><li>Four story quests</li><li>Minigolf</li><li>Golf ball collecting and random spawns</li><li>Explosions!</li><li>Custom horse animation (lol)\r\n</li><li>Giant golf ball easter egg (oops, now you know...)</li><li>VR support (Warning: Try on your own responsibility)</li></ul>\r\nWant to know more?\r\n<p>Visit the game's GitHub repository where you can find whole project documentation (it's also very useful if you want to try the game), lore, source code, and a ton of images from the game.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDisclaimers\r\n<p>This game has been developed as a semestral project for two courses. I led a team of 6 people that developed this game during one semester, but almost all the work was done by 2-3 people. None of us had done any game development before and this was our first time using Unity. <br/></p>\n<p>VR support was a requirement for one of the courses and the game was initially designed for VR. However, a VR headset was provided only for a very short time during the semester. Therefore we had to create a non-VR version game (not an excellent match for the minigolf mechanics) and VR support was additionally added by one of the team members - however not properly implemented and not tested at all. Therefore the VR version of the game is pretty nauseating and unfinished (but interesting to give it a try for the additional mechanics).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:26:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767285ae1ee5ab4010dd89c1d7c2e12c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Envilon Script"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
