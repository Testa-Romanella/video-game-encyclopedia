Still pretty much the same bad camera. But different things to avoid and new object to find to win the game. This is a bad attempt at a horror game. This time I used some paid assets. Still nothing amazing. <br/></p>\n<p>You do not need to play Rupert's Journey to play this. There is no story for either of them.<br/></p>\n<p>Again this is just a silly game I am making awful on purpose, so if you like that sort of things play it and give it a try. But if not. Just move on. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>This game isn't for everyone. Just remember to have fun.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T05:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/574df7377ac22a97e6674935534587f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperGustadolph"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
