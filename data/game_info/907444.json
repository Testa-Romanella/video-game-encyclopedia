There's only one way to find out.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Block Jumper currently consists of 51 level, each of which increasing in difficulty ranging from Beginner levels all the way up to Advanced and even Expert levels. Each level contains a Coin Token which increases the Gold you obtain for completing the level, but also appears on your Menu to reward your sense of completion. Perhaps there are other Menu aesthetics that can be obtained through completion...?<br/><br/><br/>An Endless Mode is also available for you to tackle, throwing every level in the game at you one after another. You only get one life in each Endless attempt, so if you want a good score you're going to have to be careful. Additionally, collecting Coin Tokens throughout an Endless run will increase the Gold you obtain when you meet your inevitable demise. Can you survive every level in the game with one life? Good luck.<br/><br/>A Cosmetics Shop is also present in the game, taking Gold in exchange for Player customisations. Currently this is limited to changing the color of the Player and the Player's Gun Lasers, but there is much room to expand. Additional levels and Endless modes are also a future possibility, along with potential Event Modes, but only time will reveal what the future has in store for this simple little game.<br/><br/>Enjoy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T04:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f8784d4a445cb3c68c64b7dceb4b9c9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eager Unknown"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eager Unknown"], "esrb_rating": null}
