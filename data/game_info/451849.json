First there were crashes, then inexplicable bugs. These proved in the end not so inexplicable but rather the result of sloppy initial\u00a0programming, courtesy of yours truly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end I am pretty pleased with the results, in particular the use of some nifty HDR shaders and the computer's many hats. I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>All code, art and music created by Owl_Skip in the 72 hour competition period.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/74655f1be838382808cf7dfd1d00666b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
