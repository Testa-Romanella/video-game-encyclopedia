As my final project is a game which helps teach the concepts of programming, my aim for this assignment was to make a level which would teach the player about loops and conditional logic.</p><p>The player must complete the first puzzle while staying out of sight from the first version of AI, this is to loop through camera footage to get the security ID, which is needed for the next puzzle. The next puzzle is to use the security ID to unlock the door. Finally now the player has to replace the footage while avoiding the second version of AI in order to complete the level. If spotted at any point it will be game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f14c22ade1f3328a99991857814e178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GMichaelW"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
