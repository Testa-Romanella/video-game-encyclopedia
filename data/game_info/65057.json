Bridge Trek provides you with a safe environment to conquer your gephyrophobia or acrophobia in virtual reality. Build your way up from the pillow padded foot bridge, to the perilous glass bridge in the sky!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA friend of mine confessed a crippling case of gephyrophobia (fear of bridges), so I created a VR \u201cBridge Simulator\u201d where she could face her fears in a non-threatening virtual environment. The first bridge is only a foot off the ground and surrounded by pillows. Each bridge is increasingly more intimidating; rope bridges, bridges that cross fish-filled water, bridges made of glass. Gephyrophobic or not, it\u2019s pretty intimidating, but you're only a glance away from the safety of your living room! Conquer those bridges!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you're a mental health professional, and you're interested in using Bridge Trek in your work, please reach out to me, I'd love to work with you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/161095a343e79938976f941c2c30fc27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 105}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Another Planet"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Another Planet"], "esrb_rating": null}
