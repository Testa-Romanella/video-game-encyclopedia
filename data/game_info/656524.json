Humanity has evolved and devolved to the point where it has become a shadow of its former self. You are a banana. Collect monkeys, silly banana.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"I wasn\u2019t always like this. Many centuries ago I was a wealthy and influential lobster, the lobster half of me, obviously. The other half was a fairly generic blob. After the great merge, the standard unmerging and the rather disappointing third merging which had managed to skip the second merge altogether, officially justified with the fact that the second in any series of things tends to be on the weak side, I found myself in my new form in a land obliterated with constant chaos. I had a plan. I needed monkeys. I would try to figure out a use for them further on.\"</em> - The Blobster\r\n</p>\n<p>\"<em>\u00a0Banana</em>\" -Banana Man</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design/Tech</strong></p>\n<p>Aaron Colledge\u00a0 \u00a0&amp;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Justin\u00a0 Beasley</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong></p>\n<p>Daniel Smedley, Rachel Lablaine, Jake Marriott, and Becky Farr</p>\n<p><strong>Music\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Ivy Albury\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SFX</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Nathan Haywood</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/614/614695bb0350b32761470711a26f6393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["goatfrog"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
