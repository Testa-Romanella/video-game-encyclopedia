Can you endure all \"poisons\" and discover what comes after them?<br/><br/>Some examples of the \"poisons\":<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Only one hit:</strong> you're easy to kill<br/></li><li><strong>Only one enemy:</strong> it's a good thing, right?<br/></li><li><strong>Only one way:</strong> it's not like you were going to return anyway<br/></li><li><strong>Only one key:</strong> don't need more than one for that door, right?<br/></li><li><strong>Only one room:</strong> no more wandering around<br/></li><li><strong>Only one potion:</strong> it's better be a good one<br/></li><li><strong>Only one head:</strong> see in the direction you move only<br/></li><li><strong>Only one eye:</strong> narrower vision<br/></li><li><strong>Only one form:</strong> all enemies are skeletons... or are they?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ca/9cabb5483edc58c72f9f854ba210e32e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ranmantaru Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ranmantaru Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
