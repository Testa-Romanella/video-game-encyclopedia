Limit your strokes by matching pairs and getting a Hole In One. Take the fewest strokes and go for the lowest score after 9 Holes.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Each player is dealt eight cards with a discard pile and draw pile at the center of the table. To start the game each player flips two cards face up. Moving clockwise each player draws from either the deck or discard pile and has an option to replace one of their face up or facedown cards. If a player does not want their drawn card they may choose to flip one of their facedown cards for their turn. Players work to match vertical pairs of cards to reduce their number of strokes. Just like the game of golf the person with the lowest score wins the hole. <br/><br/>Additional game instructions can be found in the app as well as an in-game tutorial that provides all the details on how to play.\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Find the physical card game on our website or Amazon.\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Visit us on the web:\u2028<br/>https://www.playnine.com<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Like us on Facebook:\u2028<br/>https://www.facebook.com/playninecardgame/\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Follow us on Instagram:\u2028<br/>https://www.instagram.com/playninecardgame/<br/><br/>Terms of Use: <br/>https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T03:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/94434cf036f79c79cce072a73eb2ae05.jpg", "website": "https://playnine.com/pages/app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bonfit America"], "genres": ["Casual", "Card"], "publishers": ["Bonfit America"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
