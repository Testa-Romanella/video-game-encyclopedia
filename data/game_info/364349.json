You wake up from a bed in a big house, without any idea who you are and where you are. Perhaps someone lives there. Your condition is bad, and therefore it could be nice with some friendly faces willing to help you out. You will quickly discover that\u2019s not the case.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As you progress you will find some interesting objects. Some objects are collectable and some are useable. The crosshair will turn green, if you look at objects of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>The inventory: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The objects you have collected, will appear in your inventory. All objects will have a COG icon. This is for using the item on other items or yourself. The MAGNIFYING GLAS icon appears on items with deeper information, for example a book to read.\u00a0As you hover over the current item in your inventory, a tooltip will describe the item.</p>\n<p><strong>The journal: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you will come across several events. Therefore, you will have a journal to keep track of these events.</p>\n<p><strong>Puzzles:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the game there are some puzzles. Most of them are important, because the will unlock your progression.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Some of the puzzles do have some clues.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Movement: ASWD\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sprint: Shift\r\n  </p>\n<p>Interact: E\r\n  </p>\n<p>Light: F\r\n  </p>\n<p>Journal: J\r\n  </p>\n<p>Menu / Close: Escape\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Game in development</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game is a demo version. you will come across several items and objects which aren\u2019t really necessary, for completing the demo. Furthermore, I am aware of certain bugs (UI), but they will be taken care of, when time allows it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The full game will contain more areas, like an outside area containing a harbor, lighthouse, forest, church, crypt and more. The game is an open world game as we know it from games like Skyrim etc. which will give the player more freedom to navigate.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I have been working solo on this game for almost a year, and finally I have something to release.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I am looking forward to get some feedback, constructive criticism &amp; suggestions from you guys.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>allantorndal@hotmail.com\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/aces/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://www.bricksite.com/aces/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T05:56:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a892a68172d7ed7bf4242fb9f1da73b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aces Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
