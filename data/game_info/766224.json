At first, I actually wanted to make a digital version of my Jam 1 tabletop game. But after I watch a lot of tutorial videos about map making, RPG, interaction, and character movement that are really overwhelming. I soon realize I don\u2019t have enough time and any programming knowledge to make a game that is that complex. So I changed my ambition to a simpler game without that much programming. I watched the Brackeys youtube How to make a Video Game series to have an idea of how to make a workable game.\u00a0 I have seen many obstacles and maze mobile games like the classic \u201cTemple Run\u201c. So I want to make a game like that. So I want to make a game that is a maze and doesn\u2019t touch the wall combined. I want to make the game like that because I haven\u2019t seen or played any of this type of 3D maze+don't touch the wall game that is published yet. So I think this kind of gameplay style will be kind of unique and pretty save on the design part. I use the default object because the game is a simplified game so it doesn't need to make the texture and the object too complex.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is easy. Basically don't Touch the red brick.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Press WASD to move around.</p>\n<p>Press E to fly. \uff08it\u2018s a cheat)</p>\n\n<p>Making this game is quite overwhelming at first. I was worried about if I can make it in time. Because it is an untouched territory for me both the unity and programming. But later on when I have a clear idea of what I want to make and continuous tutorial. It became less overwhelming and I start to understand a little bit of the C# language. I even can modify it to my liking. For example, the WASD and E\u00a0 Which is quite a sense of achievement for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:45:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14dada93c25b9769bf67fd96705f3109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex.Chen2022"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
