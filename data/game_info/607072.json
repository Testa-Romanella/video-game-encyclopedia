If you lose all bases you will fail. You can use space bar to turn your force field on/off which protects you from incoming laser bolts. You won't be able to shoot while your force field is up so you will have have to switch back and forth. You must also use the force field to keep fire balls from getting past you, if all 5 get past, you will fail. Once all enemies are destroyed you may enter the second stage, the pong boss battle.</p>\n<p>The objective of this second stage is simple, first to 10 points wins.
