I've worked on it in the beginning of 2020 at Ludo Educativo with a team of up to 5 people. The game has\u00a03 mini-games that aim to raise awareness about the coronavirus, in the first game you learn how to wash your hands, the second is to show the importance of wearing masks and the third is about social distancing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contra Corona was made by a partnership between Aptor Software, Batatando Games, University of S\u00e3o Carlos and FAPESP (Research Support Foundation of the State of S.
