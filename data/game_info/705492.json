By completing the commission, you will earn enough money to pay for your kid\u2019s birthday present. On your way out you learn that there is actually two monsters causing problems instead of one. This poses a problem for you since you only have time to defeat one of the monsters and you don\u2019t know which one is for your commission. It\u2019s up to you to decide which one to defeat so you can make it back for your kid\u2019s birthday.</p>\n<p>How to Play:\r\n  </p>\n<p>For keyboard:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>-Move: WASD keys or arrow keys\r\n  </li><li>-Jump: Space bar\r\n  </li><li>-Attack: Left CTRL button\r\n  </li><li>-Slide: Left Alt button\r\n  </li><li>-Heal: Left Shift button\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>For controller (based off Playstation 5 controller):<br/></p>\n<ul><li>-Move: Left joystick\r\n  </li><li>-Jump: X-button\r\n  </li><li>-Attack: Square-button\r\n  </li><li>-Slide: Circle-button\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Heal: Triangle-button</li></ul>\n<p>Art Design: Ansimuz, , Brackeys, Clembod, Jakub Varga</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Mixkit, Time Catch Sounds, Sounds Recorded</p>\n<p>Background Music: JP Soundworks</p>\n<p>Design and Programing: Kebiruto</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3cf8ff0666c2f80816182c4884fcf19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kebiruto"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
