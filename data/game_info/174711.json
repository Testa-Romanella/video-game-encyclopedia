This game currently lacks polish and features like Bank, Turn, &amp; Special Maneuvers.  If there is interest in this project, I could put some more time into flushing it out to be a more complete game.  I would also be interested in open sourcing this as well (through GPL), but I didn't even have time to create a git repo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db82801ab0ca4eab71de37da4b50a995.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["monkygames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
