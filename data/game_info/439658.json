There she will make new friends and learn about the clan of sorceresses who from time immemorial guarded the world. Subsequently, she will become one of them.</p>\n<p>I did not have enough time to write a worthy ending and it turned out to be a long start, so it might seem that the story is not about sorceresses, but I will expand the story in the updates, so if you like it, stay in touch!</p>\n<p>A couple of features:<br/>5 original characters;<br/>original story (hopefully);<br/>sendings;<br/>clumsy translation into English;<br/>ginger song in the finale.</p>\n<p>All characters and events are fictitious, all coincidences are random. I apologize for the inaccuracy of the translation into English, all claims should be sent to Google.
