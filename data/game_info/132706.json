Made with Clickteam Fusion 2.5. I recently replaced the tennis court to a premade perspective rather than using the perspective object. This makes sure it will be mobile friendly. I also added an umpire that closely watches the ball, and added speech bubbles to explain umpire calls. The crowd is also now more lively, which improves the atmosphere.
