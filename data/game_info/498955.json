In this momentum based 2D platformer, you play through the level and collect as many diamonds as you can. Sadly, I\u00a0couldn't figure out how to make diamonds respawn; so after you complete the level, you play through the level backwards and must return all the diamonds you collected the first time.\u00a0It's really important that you put all the diamonds back otherwise the game will break!\u00a0Your score is calculated based on the number of diamonds you collected and the time it took to collect them all and return them. As a result, you may want to consider not collecting all the diamonds as some of\u00a0 them will actually hurt your score as they may take too long to collect.</p>\n\n<p>Move with the arrow keys.
