Made with concept artist Ben Jones who was a constant input for the visuals. All 3d models apart from the environment were made by myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept is you pilot a scout ship, that can transform into a mechanised walker when on world, travelling to the 'Red Planet'. The planet is inhospitable filled with acid pools and infested with small hostile aliens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wanted to do this ship walker concept for years now so glad to finally get it into a project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:13:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d8d9ca21bb45159fd45fad0ab315214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLS_Designs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
