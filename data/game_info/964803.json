You aren't sure how you got here but you know what you must do, escape! If you can. Alchemist:  The Garden is a first-person puzzle game with one goal, to leave. The path is simple, but nothing is as easy as it seems. Do your best to figure your way to freedom. Learn the rules of the garden if you wish to escape. Once you have figured out how to leave the garden, challenge yourself to see how quickly you can leave. Caution - this game is simple but challenging! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlchemist: The Garden is a first person, open world escape room. This place is supposed to be safe, but then again, you aren't supposed to be there. So safety is not guaranteed. You can save your progress but be warned, there is a single save slot. And if you wish to beat the game with a high score, you must beat it without saving. It can take roughly 15 minutes, but that is easier said then done. Explore the garden, unlock its secrets, and see how fast you can escape.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo welcome to the garden. Please leave.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T02:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef18a2be6a61d46adc6abf8a87828bc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lost In Creation Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Lost In Creation Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
