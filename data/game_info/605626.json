But this time you move much faster, unless the circles of light roaming in the world don't catch you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen in order to move fast again, you have to collect orbs which grant you speed for a limited time. After you unlock all the altars in the level, a huge sphere appears, and you need to catch it so the gate to proceed to the next level opens again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSave progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T03:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de698ff8e3f224c560d5da875028786e.jpg", "website": "https://tongucbodur.com/loverowind", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "esrb_rating": null}
