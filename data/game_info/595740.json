But they dug\u2026 actually  they dug very appropriately deep. The whole thing was very sustainable.  Then the operation got bought by a trade guild who demanded higher  productivity, and things got messy. It\u2019s now your job to make sure  everyone gets their favourite drinks, by delivering barrels from rest  stop to rest stop down the huge mine shaft.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a short, sweet  game inspired by the cargo elevator sequence in Metal Gear Solid. I  decided to switch the theme around a bit as fantasy tends to be a little  easier for people to latch onto visually, guns make design complicated,  and it\u2019s easier to make something cute.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s systems  overlap in a way I\u2019m quite happy with - with more time I\u2019d add different  barrel types, more obstacles, more enemies, and more items (one thing I  was sad to cut was flaming torches and dark sections, where you could  throw torches to ignite oil or the elevator itself). But I think what\u2019s  here isn\u2019t too bad for the time spent.\r\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve not entered Ludum Dare  in six years! It was great to get back into it. I was pleasantly  surprised at how much faster I work now, although definitely out of  practice. I really hope you enjoy the game!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ce4ee6ceb5d3ea3788126e7fdded7f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
