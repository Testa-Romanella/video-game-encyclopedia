World is randomly generated. Amount of rooms can range from\u00a05 to 8. You can press to R key to restart current level.</p>\n<p>You will notice a box, once you start the game, if you shoot that box, you will spawn your first party member. \u00a0You can switch to that character, by pressing C. Every\u00a0character will have their own\u00a0strengths and weaknesses, for example they will shot 3 bullets instead of one, however they will shoot slower and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Current issues this prototype has:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes enemy placement can be unfair, because as soon as you enter enemies will start shooting and can be really close to you</li><li>There are only 4 type of rooms you will encounter.</li><li>There's only one level.</li><li>Has no music.</li><li>Has no boss(es).</li><li>Lack of GUI, no score, very barebones minimap, etc.</li><li>Party system is not fully implemented, it will probably\u00a0break if there's more then 2 characters in your party.</li><li>The game is way too similar to The binding of issac. It must have some mechanic to make it more\u00a0unique.</li><li>Pixel art may need some improvements.</li><li>Procedural generation sometimes will not make doors, if\u00a0rooms are next to each other, but it a rare occurrence.</li><li>This game, will only work on PC, there's no support for controllers and touch screen.</li><li>There's no challenging way to get a new party member, a good idea would be a mini boss, and after you win, you will get a new party member.</li><li>Party member will just teleport to you, if they get spawned, maybe make them not do that?</li><li>When, player dies, he just disappeares, basically no game over screen.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Will I\u00a0continue working on this Game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Probably, I don't have really good game idea based on this though, I\u00a0will need to do some more prototyping to test out ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>What will I plan to do if I\u00a0continue working on this Game?</strong></p>\n<p>Rewrite the whole game to organize the code better,\u00a0after I get a good core idea. and fix those Issues I listed.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my prototype!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93a/93aacf84b79a998558f8e7bfbe42bcc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["surrealegg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
