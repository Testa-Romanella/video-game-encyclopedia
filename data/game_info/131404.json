You will take your turn and try to make actions, every action can fail when it is executed. There's a combo system (avaible only as first action) where you can take the chance of making a 5 hits combo, if you correctly hit all buttons in the same order they appear, the combo can also fail when executed, but worth a try.<br/><br/>You will need a friend to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/352/352da836397bf7c6e2b102a089c146f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pigdev Studio", "Henrique Campos"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
