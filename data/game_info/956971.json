You are working at the public utility company of a small town,\u00a0and your main task is to provide the town with enough power for the citizens.\u00a0But beware! The citizens want you to emit as little CO\u2082 as possible.\u00a0The more CO\u2082 you emit, the lower your reputation becomes and the less money you will get.\u00a0If you do not have enough money, you can not keep up with the growing power demand\u00a0and will be replaced by someone, who, contrary to you, does a decent job.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nInputActionQ/E/middle-click + drag\u00a0rotate the camera\u00a0W/A/S/Dmove the camera\u00a0R/F/mouse wheelzoom\u00a0right-clickclear building selection\u00a0left-clickplace/Select buildingsspace\u00a0\u00a0pause/Unpause the game.increase the time speed,decrease the time speed-reset the time speed\r\nPlot Controls\r\nInputActionleft-click + drag\r\npanning\u00a0\r\nmouse wheel\r\nscroll vertically\r\n\u00a0mouse wheel + Shift\r\n\u00a0scroll horizontally\r\n\u00a0mouse wheel + Ctrl\r\nclear building selection\r\n\u00a0left-click\r\nzooming\r\nright-click + drag\r\nbox zooming\r\ndouble-clickreset view\r\n\r\nCore Mechanics\r\n<p>The game time is split into months.\u00a0Each month has a power target and a maximum CO\u2082 emission target.\u00a0At the end of every month, you get money based on your reputation and your CO\u2082 emissions.\u00a0You gain or lose reputation depending on the amount of CO\u2082 emitted.\u00a0If you emit more CO\u2082 than you are supposed to, you will lose reputation, otherwise you gain it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You start with limited technologies which will not allow you to satisfy the CO\u2082 constraints in the long term.\u00a0By researching new technologies (which costs money) you might be able to emit less CO\u2082 and satisfy your customers.</p>\n<p>Generating too little power will make you lose the game.\u00a0You will notice a red progress bar appearing in the bottom right corner if you produce less power than is demanded.\u00a0The greater your power deviation is, the faster you lose.\u00a0However, the progress bar will reset each month.</p>\n<p>To open windows like the plot window or building options, simply click the corresponding icons at the bottom left of the\u00a0screen.\u00a0If you do not know which icon corresponds to which window, hover over the icons to see their tooltips.</p>\n<p>The game is paused at the beginning. Place your buildings first and then choose a game speed you like (either using the buttons at the bottom\u00a0or the keybindings).</p>\r\nBuildings\r\n<p>The only way to generate power is to place buildings.\u00a0Each building emits CO\u2082 when built and some also emit a significant amount of CO\u2082 each month after being built.\u00a0Buildings can be placed through the buildings window.\u00a0Once you selected a building, simply click on the terrain to place it.</p>\n<p>Clicking on an already placed building will bring up a little menu.\u00a0There you can choose between destroying or upgrading the building.\u00a0Destroying buildings can be useful to meet the CO\u2082 targets, but keep in mind that destroying buildings also emits CO\u2082.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upgrades cost money and in exchange offer more power (for renewable energy sources)\u00a0and less CO\u2082 emissions (for fossil ones).</p>\n<p>The previewed building will be green if you are allowed to place it.\u00a0If you do not have enough money, if there already is a building,\u00a0or if the building can not be placed on this terrain type, the previewed building will be red.</p>\r\nCoal Plants\r\n<p>Coal plants are fairly cheap to build considering the amount of power they generate.\u00a0However, they emit a lot of CO\u2082.\u00a0Coal plants can be placed anywhere except on water.</p>\r\nGas Plants\r\n<p>Gas plants are basically coal plants, but better.\u00a0They generate slightly more power while emitting less CO\u2082.\u00a0Gas plants can be placed anywhere except on water.</p>\r\nSolar Arrays\r\n<p>Solar arrays emit a negligible amount of CO\u2082, but do not generate that much power at day and none at night.\u00a0It is recommended to compensate the lack of power generation at night with batteries.\u00a0Solar arrays can be placed anywhere except on water.</p>\r\nWind Turbines\r\n<p>Wind turbines, like solar arrays, do not produce a lot of CO\u2082, however they generate more power than solar arrays.\u00a0Their power generation varies, since it is influenced by the wind.\u00a0Wind turbines can be placed anywhere, but they produce more power if they are in the water\u00a0and even more when they are on mountains.</p>\r\nBatteries\r\n<p>Batteries enable you to store surplus energy.\u00a0This energy is fed back into the power grid, if too little power is generated.\u00a0Batteries can be placed anywhere except on water.</p>\r\nPlots\r\n<p>Plots help you to plan ahead.\u00a0They display e.g. your current power production and the power demand for all future months to come.\u00a0This allows you to decide when to build new buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are five different plots:</p>\n<ul><li>CO\u2082: Displays the CO\u2082 emissions as well as the CO\u2082 emission targets of the past and future.</li><li>Power: Displays the current power production as well as the power demand of the past and future.</li><li>Energy: Displays the currently stored energy as well as the maximum possible stored energy.</li><li>Money: Displays your money.</li><li>Reputation: Displays your reputation.</li></ul>\r\nResearch\r\n<p>Most of the buildings require research before they can be built.\u00a0To research a technology, click the corresponding button in the research window.\u00a0You can also expand the limited building space you have by researching new rows or columns.\u00a0Some technologies, like wind turbines, require other technologies to be researched first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Researching costs money, so pay attention to not spend too much on researching a technology that you then can not build.</p>\n<p>Technologies which can be researched will be marked light green,\u00a0whereas technologies which already have been researched will be marked as dark green.\u00a0Technologies which can not be researched,\u00a0either due to a lack of money or due to dependencies which have not been researched yet, will be marked red.</p>\r\nShipping Options\r\n<p>Shipping options affect the overall costs and CO\u2082 emissions of buildings when placed.\u00a0There are four shipping options: bicycles, electric cars, big trucks and standard.\u00a0For more information see their corresponding tooltips.<br/><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy</p>\n<p>- https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui</p>\n<p>-
