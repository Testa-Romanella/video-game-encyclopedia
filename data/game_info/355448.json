Slow down on a wave to stick to it (bind speed requirement depends on the boat downforce, sometimes you have to slow down more). If you keep the gas pressed, you'll jump off the waves. You can stick to water before the wave begins, but if you re-accelerate on a straight line, you'll un-stick.<br/><br/>Releasing the gas while in the air will make you fall faster.  <br/><br/>Obstacles and Power-Ups:<br/><br/>If air drag makes you quicker by staying on water, sometimes it's best to jump. It could be for grabbing a power-up, avoiding an obstacle or a tricky set of waves.<br/><br/>Combat:<br/><br/>Fighting with opponent brings a whole new dimension to the game.  It not only adds action, but also tactical aspects, which quickly becomes a key for victory. For instance, slowing down to get behind an opponent to avoid being hit and let him deplete his bullet on another boat.<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/>More Features:<br/><br/>- Career, endless and arcade mode<br/>- 15 racing tracks<br/>- 100 racing events across 7 types of race (normal, ceasefire, eliminations, demolition, carnage, last man standing, endurance)<br/>- 20 Licenses: series of mini-quests which unlock the next racing categories<br/>- 50 racing boats, each with its own specific upgradable configuration: find which boat is best suited for each event!<br/>- Over 20 types of guns<br/>- 4 racing classes: climb the ladders and become the world champion!<br/>- A boat editor with 3 custom hangars where you can craft your own boats!<br/>- One-button racing mechanic + 2 offensive/defensive buttons<br/>- Power-ups: boost, ammo, shield, coins, repair<br/>- Trophies system for replay value: finish first in all races to collect all gold trophies<br/>- Game Center: leaderboards (based on best lap time and trophies earned) and achievements<br/>- Cloud save with manual upload/download and 3 save files syncing with the iPhone, iPad and Mac versions<br/>- MFI and other controllers support<br/>- Rich original retro soundtrack", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:35:50", "background_image": null, "website": "http://www.xperimentalzgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["XperimentalZ Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Xperimentalz Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
