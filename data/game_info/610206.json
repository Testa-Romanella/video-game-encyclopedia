You're a squire to a knight, following behind the trail of monster carcasses he leaves in his wake, carrying his equipment and collecting new weapons you find as you traipse through a dungeon. But that's not all: you're also responsible for preparing his loadouts for each beast he has to face! Pack his weapons, armor, accessories, and potions as tightly as you can, but be careful to consider what items are best suited for the battle at hand! Succeed and proceed to the next room; fail, and...well, that's not really your problem, don't think about it too hard. He was kind of a turd anyways.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>You have a 60 second time limit to run around and collect items for your next battle! (Movement - WASD).</p>\n<p>Place items in your bag as you pick them up (Pickup - Space Bar)\u00a0and drop them as needed if your bag is full (Drag &amp; Drop - Mouse). Once the time limit is up, all the items on the ground disappear, but take all the time you need to customize your load out and pick what you think will work best. (Open/Close Bag - E/Esc).</p>\n<p>Talk to the hero (Space Bar)\u00a0when you're done and see if he lives or dies!</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>Right now the game goes on forever, so feel free to stop whenever you feel like you have played through a couple rooms. Also there were features planned like being able to see what monster is coming up in the next room so you can better prepare your items. Also the balance needs to be adjusted on the items :P</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> </p>\n<p>Drag &amp; Drop Items -\u00a0Mouse\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pickup Items &amp; Talk to Hero - Space Bar\u00a0</p>\n<p>Open/Close Bag - E</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art by D4yz [Jerico Landry]\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming by Steven (@Steaf321)</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by Zachary Pinkham (www.zacharypinkham.com)</p>\n<p>SPECIAL THANKS to Dmitry Barbashin for letting us use his concept art!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3qKVA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde9911983677849885774d7a5e87acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steven", "D4yz", "Zachary Pinkham"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
