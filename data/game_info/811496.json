You play as an ink blob who is stuck in pages of novels. The only way for you to escape is to scribble out\u00a0words and use them as platforms.<br/></p>\n<p>There are six levels.\u00a0Try to escape with as few missing words as possible!</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>There are two modes:\u00a0<strong>play</strong> and\u00a0<strong>edit</strong>. To toggle between them, press\u00a0<strong>A</strong>.</li><li>In\u00a0<strong>play</strong> mode, use the\u00a0d-pad to move\u00a0\u00a0your character and the\u00a0<strong>B</strong> button to jump</li><li>In\u00a0<strong>edit</strong> mode, use the d-pad to move your cursor and the\u00a0<strong>B</strong> button to redact words</li><li>You have a limited amount of ink in each level, indicated in the\u00a0HUD. If you run out of ink, you can restart by using the Playdate menu option \"Restart level\"</li><li>Use the crank to scroll up and down</li></ul>\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\nThis is a prototype and there are some bugs that I know about:\r\n<ol><li>When you complete the game, you go back to the first level. You may experience a crash when going to edit mode.</li><li>The best score field in the HUD only updates properly on the first level</li></ol>\n<p>After the jam I plan to fix these issues and possibly create something more full featured. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T11:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15e/15e49db6ae39a52c6f8691f899198e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen Jue"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
