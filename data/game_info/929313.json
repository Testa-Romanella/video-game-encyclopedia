The game that no one has been waiting for.</p>\n<p>It is just a crappy FNAF fan game about crazy animals in a shut down animal saving facility. The pay is high so you apply for the job as a security guard.</p>\n<p>There are 4 animals: Seal The Pup, Baern The Polar Bear, Pengin The Hacker and Monke The Monkey. They are trying to kill you and it is your task to monitor them through the cameras and not let them into your office by closing the door or window, but you can't keep them closed for long as it will drain your power and if your power hits 0 then the animals will get in and you will be killed. You also have a mask provided by the sponsor of the company which is Fazbear Entertainment. The mask scares off Pengin's hacks and Monke. But it is made out of toxic rubber that you can't wear for long, and you can't look at the cameras while wearing the mask.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T09:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b31a82562614c089e913412c3dd3772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boris309"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
