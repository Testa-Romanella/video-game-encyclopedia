I\u00a0used\u00a0ChipTone\u00a0for the sound effects, and I spent a couple minutes in\u00a0Bosca Ceoil\u00a0for the music. Since there were no relevant game jams for me to participate in-- and I'm not yet at the skill level to do it in those time limits-- I made this according to my own personal goals I though I could achieve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>If you are to play this game, I\u00a0only ask that you tell me what you think of it in the comments, and let me know of any issues or questions you might have. And remember: if you find any sort of bug or problem, let me know about it and how I could recreate it, so I can make my first game the highest quality that I can achieve.\u00a0</p><p>Also\u00a0send me a screenshot of your high score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbddcdef66bdf01b69a93c42479f3ae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Paraxenos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
