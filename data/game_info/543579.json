After your car breaks down on the side of the road in the woods, you find a path that leads to a cabin, but that is where your terrifying journey begins.  You are armed with only a flashlight and your wits.  You must figure out what happened here if you are to escape. With a wide range of game interaction and unique terrifying locations, your heart is sure to be pounding out of your chest the whole time.  This is a very early access of the game and I am still implementing a lot of new features, enemies, systems, and visuals.\u00a0 P.S. All profits are going to be used to help further development of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5e0e45579a77991447a84af790a2b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gregomon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
