{"id": 773756, "slug": "a-life-worth-living", "name": "A Life Worth Living", "name_original": "A Life Worth Living", "description": "Summary &amp; Setting\r\n<p>New Pine Creek, or just New Pine, was an idyllic little country town with more\u00a0 farms and farmers than you knew what to do with. Every season was picturesque there, especially winter. It snowed every year, and looked like the picture off of a holiday popcorn can every holiday season.\r\n</p>\n<p>You lived in New Pine since you were a baby. For a while, you were one of the only \u2018younger kids\u2019 in town, since the kids that moved in tended to be eight and older, or babies that you couldn\u2019t play with. Really, people moved in and out all the time; it became a normal part of your life that kids didn\u2019t tend to stay. Until the weekend before winter break, that is. Two new families moved in; one next door and the other across the street. And a girl your age started visiting more, since her brother started visiting more. These three kids were all your age, six. Unlike the others, they became a staple part of your life. But, did you really get along with them? As you grew up, did you remain close?\r\n</p>\r\nCharacters(As of childhood)\r\nYour family;\r\n<p>Your Dad, Fox: (he/him, 30) A tall man with black hair and bronzed skin. He works hard to make sure you and your siblings have whatever you all want. He\u2019s sunny and sweet with a sharp edge that he turns towards people he doesn\u2019t trust, though you don\u2019t see that much. He explains everything he can to you &amp; your siblings, and if he doesn\u2019t understand he isn\u2019t afraid to ask for help! You don\u2019t see a lot of adults do that! Some people are put off by your dad, but you don\u2019t understand why.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your Older Brother, Dante: (he/him, 10) A boy with Dad\u2019s hair and bronze skin. He doesn\u2019t have his height, though. He strives to be just like Dad, and greatly enjoys sharing his hobbies. He hopes to stream video games online, like your Dad does now. He also makes you follow him around, ever the protective older brother. He takes an interest in the things you like, too. Even if it was frilly pink dresses or the scariest horror movie, he\u2019s willing to follow you through it all.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your Younger Sister, Monica: (she/her, 4) A toddler with dark magenta hair and pale skin, She doesn\u2019t care about much. Your sister\u2019s goal right now is to destroy her toys, roughhouse with your brother, and run wild. Too bad she can\u2019t do that last bit, but she can do everything else!\r\n</p>\r\nThe Abrams\r\n<p>Dagon Abram: (They/them, 6) A excitable kid with curly fawn colored hair and matching brown eyes; their pockets are seemingly endless, with how much stuff they carry with them all the time; a pack of chalk, candy, a pinecone, a mini shovel? A live frog?! A-anyway, Dagon is more than happy to follow along with whatever you want to do. They, like your brother, are more than happy to indulge in your interests, even if they aren\u2019t really enjoying it. With how hard they try, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve never had a friend before\u2026\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nThe Laaksonens\r\n<p>Markus Laaksonen: (He/him, 10) A boy with dark brown hair and deep blue eyes; He lives to cause as much trouble as he can. He\u2019s been a part of your life forever now, since he\u2019s your brother's best friend. He lives on a farm just outside town, but rides into town everyday to hang out with your brother. He\u2019s grown protective over you and Monica, and has started bringing his sister with him to visit town.\r\n</p>\n<p>Tindra Laaksonen: (She/her, 6) A shy girl with platinum blonde hair and deep blue eyes, she reads more than she talks. She is a loner who prefers animals to people, but is willing to talk to you if you strike up a conversation. She carries a stuffed owl with her everywhere; in fact, owls are her favorite animals! No one hangs out with her at school, they say she\u2019s \u2018weird,\u2019 but you know better than them! \u2026Right?\r\n</p>\r\nThe Bernes\r\n<p>Laverne Berne: (he/him, 6) A boy with teal colored hair and green eyes, he isn\u2019t very approachable. He doesn\u2019t talk, either, instead he uses sign language and a notepad to communicate with others. You do know that he likes snowboarding, anything about snowboarding makes him open up. He gets mad easily, but this seems exaggerated. You wonder why?\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Play as male, female, or nonbinary; straight, bi, gay, ace, aro, or demi!
