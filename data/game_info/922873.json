Are you ready to shakedown the new car in the French Alps?<br/>\n<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Made in a custom engine written in C++.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a very very early state of the game, this is not even early access, everything will change in the future. I've hurried to release the game to coincide with Rallye Monte Carlo which is happening right now. I'm planning to add a new stage for each event as it happens in real life.</p>\n<p>Please send feedback as I have no idea how well the game works on other machines!</p>\n\n\n<p>A big chunk of the engine and the game has been written and modeled live on stream, which you can find on twitch. Follow me there as I will stream more in the coming days. You can also find old streams in this YouTube playlist. Aaaand, join my discord if you wish to discuss this game and other projects or just rant about C++.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>What it does have and doesn't right now:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>One car</li><li>One track</li><li>Not even any kind of a  menu.
