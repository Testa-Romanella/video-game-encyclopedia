These features will then be improved and integrated into the \"Steam Edition\".<br/>In\u00a0<strong>Dytrinxy\u00a0</strong>you fight in different arenas against different types of monsters that always spawn in waves. In the first wave, there are only 5 monsters you have to defeat, there will always be one more per wave!</p>\n<p>Each arena has a different \"main enemy\" by killing the monsters you get Coins, Fragments and XP. With these Coins and Fragments you can buy Items in our Item shop ! You can also build your own level in the Level Editor ! You can choose different types of walls and statues and pillars, after you build your level you can Play your own level !<br/></p>\n<p>In the near future I will do a design competition, you can build a level and send pictures of it to me. Then I choose the best one and the best one will come in the game for everyone! The test versions really helped me a lot to optimize and adapt the game, also very good suggestions were made what could be added. Thanks to all testers! But now it's your turn ! Download, try it and say me your opinion about my first game !</p>\n<p><em><strong>Known bugs :<br/></strong></em></p>\n<ul><li>Coins and fragments collected in the round are not displayed in the \"Died screen\".</li><li>The mouse cursor is sometimes a cross.</li><li>Menu anchor bugs</li></ul>\n<p>Join our Discord and give us feedback or chat with the developer !<br/>Link : https://discord.gg/3NRxHUG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd28cba347444e670cf9c29bbace6d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Faithlux Studio"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
