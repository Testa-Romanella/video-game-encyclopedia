The game follows shortly after the events of Mega Man X5 in which planet Earth was devastated by an attack by the \"Maverick\" leader Sigma and the protagonist Zero sacrificed his own life to save it. As the world recovers, a Maverick known only as the \"Zero Nightmare\" has begun spreading chaos. Zero's comrade Mega Man X, curious of its name, seeks out this new threat.
