To fix this, I made a debug build that can be downloaded here. I didn't change the code in that build, I only changed it to be a debug build. Because of this change, our entry is disqualified from winning the game jam, which I think is completely appropriate. I only want people to get the opportunity to see our work.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You are Vitus Lucretius, master thief and public enemy number one in the Roman Empire.
