But thats not our strength.\u00a0<br/><br/>We tried with this game to create an atmosphere from Nintendo64, the old classical style. Enjoy the Game. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:22:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/895a7e01642e5697c57fa11c9bac6ff5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tootooni"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
