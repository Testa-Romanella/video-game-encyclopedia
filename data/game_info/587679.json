You will awaken in derelict the depths of Mars Site-113, the most advanced off-world facility The Foundation has ever created, to discover what happened during your long hypersleep and piece together the solution to the single most devastating event humanity has ever seen. Who or what you find in the facility will ultimately determine your fate. Choose your path wisely.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIncluded SCPs and Characters:<br/>\r\nWe plan include classic and of course brand-new SCPs that will have their own unique looks as well as unique interaction styles to ensure combat and stealth gameplay strategies are both viable and variable depending on the situation you find yourself in. There also may be some characters that you will be able to interact with, which can even include SCPs that traditionally have been portrayed as hostile. Platforming and puzzle solving elements will be mixed into the gameplay to create a challenging and fun interaction for players throughout the experience. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMultiplayer:<br/>\r\n For the first time ever, you will bring the fight to SCPs in their natural habitats. The Hunt gamemode will allow you to contain and destroy SCPs around the world. You and your team will need to gear up, customize your weapons and plan your containment or elimination strategy carefully to ensure you make it back to base....alive. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe SCPs will have to ensure the MTF is unable to deploy and maintain their containment field-generators while working together to eliminate the MTF entirely. Elements of each round will have various random elements (weapons, spawning, equipment, etc) to ensure each round is fresh, fun and replayable.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T02:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef5/ef52592515bc8e9e6cfc7df6d952c8e1.jpg", "website": "https://www.hstgamestudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HST Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HST Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
