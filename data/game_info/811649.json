The playground can also be seen as a gallery/museum of my previous projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1aec0966da86afd25b746b47e39d5cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jwiebbelling"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
