They&#39;re slimy monsters that are holding space colonists captive aboard seven alien starships. This super action game challenges you to free the helpless hostages. Search each ship&#39;s deadly levels, using flamethrowers and laser cannons to vaporize alien scum. Look for maps to help you find your way. After you&#39;ve saved all the captives from one ship, you must destroy its powerful leader before you can move on to the next ship. Remember, to the aliens, you&#39;re slime. And they want you good... and dead!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T09:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cba/cbad2332a8fd497b4031684d18d6df44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 379, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "NES"], "developers": ["Sanritsu Denki", "Softek", "Sims Vincent"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Tengen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
