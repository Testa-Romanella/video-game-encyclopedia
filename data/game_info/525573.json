We'll just harvest a few souls and craft some minions! <br/>\r\nHypercide is a VR game where you play as the villain to the human race. You pick up monsters and throw them through the veil of reality and onto earth where they will automatically begin their attack. Beware though, you have limited mana to send minions so you must pick wisely. The humans are not so weak they will not resist either.  They will send their strongest.  Cops, Soldiers, Super Soldiers, Tanks, Heroes with magic swords, Super heroes, even shonen protagonists; wipe them all out! Then use the souls you gathered to level up your minions so you can attack the more resilient cities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was inspired by working customer service and IT jobs for many years.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T02:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/0273ba3d6c0169fc095a76f409e7525e.jpg", "website": "https://hypercide.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Albert Guo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inverse Tower"], "esrb_rating": null}
