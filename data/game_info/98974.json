With conviction they hunt, seeking prey in the chill of darkness, feeding in a cloak of feathers, and sight honed with critical purpose. The free only escape when hidden, yet out of site the hawk still remains.\"</p>\n\n<p>Extech is an Hand drawn platformer game that clings to the line of art, politics and culture. It is the year 2025 and in the years prior Americans elected a dictator, the resulting years led to war, disaster and famine for anyone with a pulse. Only those without a heartbeat survived. Extech puts you in the middle of a great war between robots some time after the earths destruction. A world after mankind, a world beyond the clutches of human war and in a world where the fittest still survive... Only now Mechanics Thrive. A mix between Run and Gun and platformer this game will keep you entertained with odd looking characters and a storyline about Bots unintended departure on an adventure against the powers of corruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Story Line:</p>\n<p>Bot grew up amongst the most loving of families. They were a small family when his father left to fight Biomech, they were made smaller yet when he didn't make it back. Bot, a timid robot thrust into disaster, set out on an impossible task. His objective is to unite two competing robot groups Extech and Biomech. Meanwhile, Voltaire seeks to divide the two by pitting their very instincts to survive against each other .</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>\r\nkeyboard:</p>\n<p>AD=Move Left/right<br/>\r\nW=Jump/Duble Jump<br/>\r\nSpace in air=kick attacks<br/>\r\nSpace on ground= Punch attacks<br/>\r\nSpace on wall= Flip attack<br/>\r\nSpace While sliding= Flip attack<br/>\r\nDown arrow= Duck<br/>\r\nDown arrow/ A or D= Slide<br/>\r\nDown While in arrow= Ground pound</p>\n<p>Mouse:<br/>\r\nLeft Click=Shoot/selection<br/>\r\nRight Click=Skip Dialogue</p>\n<p>Debug:</p>\n<p>R=restart</p>\n<p>F1= Full screen</p>\n<p>Here are some process drawings of Extech ready to be imported into the game and detailed.
