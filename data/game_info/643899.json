Deciding to take one for themselves and mold\u00a0it to their own image, each planet became home to plethora of wonderous creatures and industrious sentient life.<br/><br/>This is the grimdark fantasy world of Tarrece.\u00a0You wake up on an uncharted island, the only survivor of a tragic zeppelin malfunction. You must use your wits and bravery to survive and explore the landscape in search of some way home.<br/><br/>Tales from Tarrece: Castaway is a minimalist survival adventure inspired by games like Kingdom: Two Crowns, Rust, and Dark Souls. With a hand drawn 2d aesthetic and intense pixel perfect combat, I'm aiming to deliver\u00a0modern controls and a satisfying gameplay loop in a small package.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8bd7e287dc7baa45c12d28bf0423b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SomeNerdyDude"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
