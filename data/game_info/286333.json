So, Fire - Fire - Water Gem - Fire Gem will destroy the Water Gem, as will Fire - Fire - Fire Gem - Water Gem. But note that the Fire Gem is\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>destroyed, as it is not touching three of the opposing element - only one.</p>\n<p>You can clear groups vertically or horizontally.</p>\n<p>If you clear under a stack of elements, they will fall. Gems will not.</p>\n<p>Elements can be used to clear up opposing elements in the \"wrong place.\" If an element touches multiple of the opposite element it will destroy them all (not gems).</p>\n<p>An element connected to a line of opposing elements will clear all the opposition -\u00a0<em>unless\u00a0</em>they're touching a gem of the same type. So, Fire will clear Water - Water - Water - Water. But if it's Water - Water - Water <strong>Gem\u00a0</strong>then only the first Water will clear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c491c0c0d09128b2f83ff923353f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joshua McLean"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
