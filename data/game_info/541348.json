Replace towers with trees to restore the environment and generate energy to fuel your attacks. Level up to take on greater challenges as cities grow and defend themselves. <br/><br/><br/>Battle against a rotating cast of procedurally-generated cities and watch them expand and adapt to your assault. Obstacles like meteor-intercepting missiles and wildfire-fighting water tankers will require careful consideration to defeat - or an overwhelming show of force.<br/><br/><br/>But you have more in your corner than just raw power. Combine disasters to overcome obstacles and outmaneuver crafty defenses. Use the environment to your advantage, cratering the ground to deny your enemy territory or manipulating the seas to trigger massive tsunamis.<br/><br/><br/>In this game, you\u2019re not a city builder. You\u2019re a force of nature.
