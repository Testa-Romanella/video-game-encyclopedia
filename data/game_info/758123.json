On your way home from school, you go to a store near you to buy groceries for dinner, but you are being followed. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Yuri and her mother live alone in an apartment only a few hundred meters from their school. Her mother separated from her father two years ago after many incidents of domestic violence and cut off all contact between him and her daughter. A month ago he ambushed Yuri in front of the school to talk to her. When he grabbed her shoulder, she ran away in panic because she hasn't forgotten the violence. She didn't tell her mother about the incident, nor did she tell the empathetic young man in the shop. When she used to tell people about her problems, they often downplayed her. That's why she has become more and more withdrawn since the incident two years ago and only talks superficially with her mother.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Emono is compatible with Keyboard/ Mouse &amp; XBox 360 Controller.</p>\n<p>WASD/ LSB - Move</p>\n<p>Shift/ LSB (Press) - Sprint<br/></p>\n\n<p>100mb of free space</p>\n<p>Dual Core CPU</p>\n<p>2GB RAM<br/></p>\n<p>256MB VRAM</p>\n<br/><strong>Game Page https://lolscrubs.itch.io/<br/>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwrSfc2UKrp1QKaEkBt3mFw<br/>Twitter @MediaMegabyte</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a57afce272636eb4c7a99f3544b49a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lolscrubs"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
