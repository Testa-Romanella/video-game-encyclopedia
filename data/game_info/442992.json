The player must manage their personal\u00a0needs while also studying for their upcoming online\u00a0test and avoiding confrontations with their alcoholic father.<br/></p>\n<p>A child's perspective informed the visual language of this game: vibrant, low-poly, and cartoonish, but as with a\u00a0\u00a0neglected child, there is \u00a0an underlying \u00a0sadness that I hope I have evoked through the music, setting, and tone of the gameplay.</p>\n<p>It is in a very rough prototype state at the moment. Important elements I have yet to implement are win/lose conditions, saving/loading features, start/pause\u00a0menus, and most importantly\u00a0the\u00a0father.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move, mouse to look, space bar to interact. Try to manage your needs without letting them drop to 0...or don't, currently there are no repercussions. Just check out the setting and see what things you can do. And maybe take a\u00a0look out the window every so often.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Movement Controller</p>\n<p>Status Bars</p>\n<p>\u00a0Crossfade</p>\n<p>Music Player</p>\n<p>Day/Night Cycle</p>\n<p>Trigger insights from my class videos</p>\n\n<p>Some low-poly assets from\u00a0Kenny or found on the Unity Asset Store, others made by me</p>\n<p>Music from R3 Music Box</p>\n<p>Sound effects from Freesound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cbcd299dfd0c6a127d749b87117ee5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jincks"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
