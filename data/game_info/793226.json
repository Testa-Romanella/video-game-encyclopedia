The game was originally intended to be satirical and not particularly educational but I\u00a0pivoted towards an\u00a0educational angle towards the end.\u00a0I'll let you be the judge of if any of the satire that I\u00a0left landed (though there wasn't much to begin with).</p>\n\n<p>This is just a prototype and I imagine it'll stay that way, except for maybe some bug fixes and a couple of features in an update. I might not update it at all though. This was\u00a0originally planned to be more fleshed out but time constraints... I'll probably release the original design document and other things later on though if you're curious to know what got cut and how it changed.</p>\n\n<p>If you're curious to see how I made the game, I'll probably make a full devlog series on its development soon. But in the meantime or if you want a closer look, the source code is available on my GitHub under a GPL 3 license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known issues (I\u00a0might fix these at some point):<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Saving and loading doesn't work (it's not implemented at all yet :P)</li><li>The light gets stuck in the dark state in DNG if you hold click</li><li>Some of the facts are probably inaccurate :/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:47:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/12793913b35fc6570da6203557271802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Nico Clack"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
