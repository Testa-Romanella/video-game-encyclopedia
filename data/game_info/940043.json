I came up with a pretty solid idea on day 3, but sadly I didn't have enough time to complete it. Despite it being unfinished, I still wanted to submit to at least show my idea.<br/><br/>I will be continuing to add features later this week, so let me know what features you think I should add. Also, tip for fellow unity enjoyers: don't use Task.Delay() for webgl builds. Apparently it uses multithreading capabilities of some kind (which causes webgl projects to not run).<br/><br/>Next time I need to work with an artist...
