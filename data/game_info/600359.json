Use the keys 1, 3, 7, and 9 to move Qbert from tile to tile.</p>\r\nCore Features:\r\n<p>1. Qbert that can step on tiles to win the round.</p>\n<p>2. Red balls that can kill Qbert on contact. The red balls do not chase you however, they simply hop down the pyramid randomly and kill themselves by jumping off the map if they don't end up hitting you.</p>\n<p>3. Green balls that freeze enemies in place for several seconds and give you points</p>\n<p>4. Coily the snake - that starts out as a purple ball, and chases you when you get to the bottom pyramid.</p>\n<p>5. Wrong way - hops along the side of a pyramid, behaves much like the red ball in that he can kill you, but he has no perception to chase after you unlike Coily.</p>\n<p>6. Ugg - same as wrong way, but he hops in the opposite direction\u00a0</p>\r\nLeaderboards\r\n<p>Can you beat your friends? Try it out, only the top 10 scores are visible which makes for a competitive experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/1379130084a50016d89c53f80ed7900c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DemonKing715"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
