With the power of imagination and the emotions felt through the songs listened, the environment was able to change and help the child find a way home. In a mystical forest full of creatures to explore with a beautiful cel shading aesthetic, with great soundtrack to relax to, the player can experience a calming time.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Keyboard controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera Control<br/></p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>1/2/3 - Change Music</p>\n<p>M - Mute Music</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Xbox gamepad controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Right Analog - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Analog - Camera Control<br/></p>\n<p>A - Jump</p>\n<p>X/Y/B - Change Music</p>\n<p>Share - Mute Music</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Playstation gamepad controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Right Analog - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Analog - Camera Control\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2715\u00a0- Jump</p>\n<p>\u25a2/\u25b3/\u3007 - Change Music</p>\n<p>Select - Mute Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:40:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0bedc7e891bfa2e6640a2e60c382e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gon\u00e7alo Pinto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
