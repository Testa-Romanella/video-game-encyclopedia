{"id": 55026, "slug": "formula-one-grand-prix", "name": "Formula One Grand Prix", "name_original": "Formula One Grand Prix", "description": "<p>Formula One Grand Prix (known as World Circuit in the United States) is a racing simulator released in 1992 by MicroProse for the Atari ST, Amiga and PC created by game designer Geoff Crammond. It is often referred to as Grand Prix 1, MicroProse Grand Prix, or just F1GP. Although the game itself was not affiliated officially with the FIA or any Formula One drivers, team liveries and driver helmets were accurate to represent the 1991 season, but the names were fictional. The game is a simulation of Formula One racing at the time and was noted for its 3D graphics and attention to detail, in particular the players ability to edit the teams and drivers and set up their car to their own personal specifications. The game was ranked the 27th best game of all time by Amiga Power.</p>\n<p>Grand Prix's success spawned three sequels, called Grand Prix 2, Grand Prix 3 and Grand Prix 4. These were exclusively PC games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc0c2f53f1fffe5b8864300199feaaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MicroProse"], "esrb_rating": null}
