Fusing a unique hand-drawn aesthetic with exciting combat, rich detailed environments and a thrilling story, join Freja in her perilous journey through lands of monsters, giants and gods!</p>\n<p>This project is unfinished due to financial issues, hopefully one day we will be able to return to it and complete it.</p>\n<p>My team: Frank, Romy, Myself (Lasse), Martinique and others devoted so much time and energy into this project. I\u00a0would like to thank them for their thankless devotion and hard work.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the development is on hold for now but I hope that this demo can bring some small pleasure into your life in some way.</p>\n<p>To our backers on Kickstarter:\u00a0Thank you all so so much, we are so sorry for putting you in this position. I know Kickstarter comes with an inherent risk but I honestly never thought we would be the people to let our backers down. All our physical rewards should be sent out (please let us know if you havent received yours yet). We will put together a small soundtrack as well to go out to you all. If you are a higher tier backer, we will still be sorting out your outstanding rewards (such as the artworks etc). I still dream of making a game and my pledge to you all is that if our studio ever releases any game, now or in the future, you will all get a free copy of every game we ever make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c78b3a9d4e2edbfafa452698f6edd6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unsigneddoublecollective"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
