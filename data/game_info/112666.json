Players each have a deck of 40 cards, or spells, and 100 life, the first to knock their opponent down to zero life wins!</p>\n<p>The way players do this is by chaining their Spells together, as players take turns drawing cards and playing spells. Each spell has a chain number ranging from 1 to 5, 1 being the start of the chain and 5 being the end. Players must start each chain at 1 but can then go up to 5 if able.</p>\n<p>Players can also build and save their decks within the game, to allow players that extra bit of customization.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a8bbb3e139b40d37aa8c6e0c86fc29d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scottxciv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
