In this milestone, I have implemented basic AI, GameMode, GameState, and a PlayerController.

I've added a death state and widget screen that pops up for that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The outline for the level is still\u00a0rough, but hopefully I will be able to implement more detail and interaction with this level.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>W -&gt;\u00a0Move forward</p>\n<p>D -&gt;\u00a0Move backward</p>\n<p>Mouse -&gt; look to go in the direction you want</p>\n<p>Spacebar -&gt;\u00a0Jump</p>\n<p>E-&gt; Interact with objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96073523582f0bc8c113dead66c20d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grackishi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
