It was a peaceful day in Myyrmanni everything seemed normal and the mall was packed with life until a man-made bomb accidentally went off creating something horrible. You suddenly wake up in a very dark and abandoned mall. The explosion in Myyrmanni was no ordinary explosion. It accidentally created a portal between realms which sucked in select people including you the player to an alternate realm where all kinds of unimaginable horrors roamed the land of Myyrmaki. The portal only selected a few people and closed soon after for good. And now it is up to you to get back to the realm of humans. In the game, you play as Pentti, a \"pro-amis\" 17-year-old vocational school student from Finland. The portal selected Pentti and now you the player must figure out how YOU can survive the horrors of the mall and Escape from Myyrmanni.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For now, the game will be set in an improvised Supermarket but I want to model the whole Myyrmanni Mall sometime. I will continue this project after this game jam.</p>\n<p>Audio settings work only in the main menu for now.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>ESC - Back to MainMenu</p>\n<p>WASD - Move around</p>\n<p>Shift - Run</p>\n<p>Mouse2 - Zoom</p>\n<p>CTRL - Crouch</p>\n<p>E - Pick up Item</p>\n<p>Q - Drop Item</p>\n<p>F - Toggle Flashlight</p>\n\n<p>Finnish College Jam #3 Submission</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T17:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84ac453cffe88b384ef098e10cee7e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dZy19"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
