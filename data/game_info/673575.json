{"id": 673575, "slug": "the-origin-system", "name": "The Origin System", "name_original": "The Origin System", "description": "What is The Origin System?\r\n<p>Origin is designed to be a free, rules-lite, narrative-focused, genre-agnostic, brutal survival, tabletop roleplaying game for groups of 2-4 people, that is easy to play both digitally and in person.</p>\r\nFree Forever\r\n<p>It is important to me as a creator that everyone always has unrestricted access to anything I publish. No one should have to miss out because of their financial situation. Origin and all its related content is and will forever be free and available for anyone who wants to download it, without exception.</p>\n<strong>Rules Lite</strong>\n<p>Origin is meant to be rules lite so it doesn't slow down play with complex mechanics. There are certainly more minimal systems out there, but the goal here is to provide a simple toolset that is easy to understand and remember.</p>\n<strong>Genre Agnostic</strong>\n<p>This system is meant to be flexible enough to support nearly any genre. Want a high fantasy adventure? Sure. Want a gritty cyberpunk mystery? Let's do it.</p>\n<strong>Brutal Survival</strong>\n<p>While many other systems and games out there offer a power fantasy, Origin is offering something different. A more atmospheric experience, where the world is dangerous and any encounter can turn deadly. It's really designed for those who want a more challenging and slow-paced experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69e093389b07b2b22d191f24206fb40e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xandrstable"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
