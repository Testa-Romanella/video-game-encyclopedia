And of course LD47 was took place in October as well, so technically I did not have the whole month for this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a racing game with a taxi, where you collect coins and fares, and unlock abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a good idea to invest my time to this project. I cleared some part, used some design pattern, made the movement smoother. It was instructive and joyful, and of course some parts gave me a headache (no sounds, shaky camera movement, no UI refresh). But it was challenging and fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As my post-mortem I should reflect on the part to be productive, everyday. It was good to build some cool habits, but it was sometimes challenging. I'm a stay home mom with a 2 years old, with some love for gaming and game development. Usually I did it as a refresh/change from diapers and toy trains. Load my batteries and do some brain exercise. Some day it was hard to manage some work, and not just play some game, or watch something, or just take a nap after lunch with the kid :)\u00a0So in the future (because I'm tent to keep) I think some 6 days of work every week could suit my life now. And the other thing, I've already mentioned in my Tweets, you should do a time tracker, and declare a goal, like 60 minutes or 90. And sometimes watching tutorials, or read some dev stuff count as well!!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/search?q=%40kregames%20%23devtober&amp;src=typed_query<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db07113f364a954cea77d5f1ede89c76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KR\u00c9"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
