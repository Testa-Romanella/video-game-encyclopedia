Quite silly but I am proud of it. Mainly a music composer, I decided to make a simple game and add some music and sfx as a demo reel. One thing led to another and this is the result.</p>\n<p>It is a basic level and waves of mushrooms spawn from two locations. There are 5 waves and a boss wave, and it goes on and on. Every time the cycle repeats, enemies become more difficult to kill and give you more points.</p>\n<p>Considering the fact that there are no items that fill your health bar, it is getting harder and harder pretty fast.</p>\n<p>When you lose all your lives, game resets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c4565c8b4e6e98f50fa117acb584ec5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["andreastmusic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
