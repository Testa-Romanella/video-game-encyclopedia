Back then, a nuclear reactor meltdown had caused an evacuation, which had split up the character's family, uprooting them from the complex that multiple generations had lived within. You, the character, find themselves here after you found an old shoebox of photos your grandfather had taken, but dormant family issues and drama rekindled. You hope to understand the bigger picture more clearly. The apartment is dilapidated, and, as much as it could be in arid New Mexico, is beginning to be reclaimed by nature. Not everything could be packed up and taken. Stories are uncovered here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/081/081b087e555e983af8005662bbb4586f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneRedShoe", "gavmil1", "AbDaug", "daifukuu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
