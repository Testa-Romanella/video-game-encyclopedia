You can wallrun by touching walls while in the air. Jump, move away from the wall, or stop moving to stop wallrunning. Mouse to aim, left click to shoot, R key to reload. Press P to respawn if you fall off the map or something and ESC to go back to main menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/3395b640d55022faa4332af2b0f92f80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Steven"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
