The feature set is limited but well-rounded.</p>\n<p>As this is a side project, I may or may not invest more time and money to add features or polish. The probability of further investment rises with community interest and feedback, so please get in touch if you have feedback.</p>\r\nMay not be appropriate for children\r\n<p>The word pool contains some explicit words, which were automatically extracted from large bodies of text.</p>\r\nDoes not teach touch-typing\r\n<p>The game aims to improve your existing typing skills, as it does not contain a touch-typing tutorial.</p>\n<p>There are many great resources if you are looking for a touch-typing tutorial. Some examples of those are listed here:\u00a0https://beebom.com/typing-software/.</p>\n<p>I can't recommend any tools for learning the basics personally, as I learned touch-typing decades ago. Thus, I have not taken the time to evaluate the currently available tools in detail.</p>\n<p>For switching to a non-standard keyboard layout (which involves a lot of re-learning), I found the following tools very helpful:</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.keybr.com/ is a free online tool designed for (re)learning to type on a non-standard keyboard layout. Instead of the typical typing drills based on letter placement on the QWERTY keyboard, it introduces letters one by one from common to uncommon. The introduction speed is based on your typing proficiency with the current set of letters. keybr has helped me get back up to speed after switching keyboard layouts.</li><li>https://monkeytype.com/ is a free online tool for typing practice. It has tons of options that allow you to shape your typing practice precisely to your liking. Additionally, it features a rich set of statistics to keep you motivated.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c455694ffc319258751370b50e21bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kristian Bergmann"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
