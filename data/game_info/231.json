Choosing which to equip requires strategic thinking - the way you lay them out is crucial, and some must be sacrificed because cards are also the precious resources you need to heal and use powerful abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCareful though because baddies can loot you! The cards they steal drop into other players\u2019 games. When you defeat an Elite Baddie you\u2019ll get another player\u2019s card: will you return it or keep it for yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEither way, prepare for a visit from that player's Holographic Helper to shower you with thanks or terrible vengeance - Loot Rascals is a tale of friendship, loss, and redemption!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery game is different in this procedurally generated roguelike: gather Loot Cards, show the Thing Below who\u2019s boss, and fly Big Barry to victory!", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T09:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5f176f373dd716541ed2a0e6de778a.jpg", "website": "http://lootrascals.com", "rating": 2.11, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 316, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Hollow Ponds"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hollow Ponds"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
