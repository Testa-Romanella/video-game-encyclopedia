Your job is to select the right part from two randomly picked options for each part of the weapon, and aim to build the right weapon for the job.</p>\n\n<p>The game itself was made in\u00a0Unreal Engine using Blueprints, and the models were made in Maya and textured with Photoshop. All sound effects were made using FMOD.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Developer/Programmer: Diermas</li><li>Artist/Modeller: Equi Bot</li><li>Sound/Music: Stuart Cunningham</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb09ee4ae5d0cb44279e425ef392404.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diermas", "Equi Bot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
