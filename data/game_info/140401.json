The board consists of 9 cubes (at the beginning, on the next levels there are 16, 24 and even 36 cubes), whose colors you have to match. After tapping, each cube changes its color in a specific, predefined order (red-yellow-green-blue-violet). Matched (two or more) cubes are automatically picked up from the board. Your goal is obviously to clear the whole board of cubes. What are you waiting for? :) There are 500 levels to complete.</p><p>This is a PC/Mac port of the mobile game, available on App Store and Play Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/58627d0ad0a28fae69b960f08b0afe9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Szymon Kosok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
