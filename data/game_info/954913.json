If not, thanks to this game, you will have the opportunity to feel at least a little bit like you are there. You will have the privilege that the locals currently do not have - the opportunity to \"ride\" the Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram (PST) route, which has been undergoing renovation for over half a year. Various obstacles will await you on the way, which you will overcome with a modern Pozna\u0144 tram. In addition to the main levels, you will have the opportunity to play various mini-games, including stacking several \"toitoi\" on top of each other or fixing broken pipes to save the PST from further flooding. Don't wait, get on the tram today! Thanks to you, the route can become passable again.</p>\n\n<p>Also if you want to exit game, you have to do alt+f4. Yeah, i again forgot to program proper menu. Enjoy\u00a0 :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/eddc5a6d9909081b03aeb6856d615493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosinus215", "DAX.PL", "karmeloova", "wikson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
