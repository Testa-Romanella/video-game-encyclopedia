However... Some creatures lurk in the foliage... so tread carefully... or you will not get the Planet Embars back to the Doc in one piece.</p>\n\n<p>The Other Planets is a game inspired by many other games with a retro sci-fi genre and art style. The game will consist of bright contrasting colours such as orange and blue and be pixel by art design. As mentioned, there is a lot of inspiration, and The Other Planets aims to be a mini-mobile platformed top-down game highlighted by The Outer Worlds (Bethesda 2019). The game will be developed via Unity as this specific engine is one of, if not, the best 2D game development tool as of current. The game will most likely be an exploration objective game with some enemies to raise the risk factor and help beef the game\u2019s content.   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/5713df9197590afbb7e26e6fd1766b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Findlay4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
