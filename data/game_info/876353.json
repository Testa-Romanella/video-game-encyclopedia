However, there is a bug where you can't actually put an appointment on 11:30 or else you'll lose. Basically you can put an appointment anywhere in the given time range except for exactly on the end of the range. Also, you can't place anything on 5:30pm.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE TO RUN ON WINDOWS:</strong></p>\n<p>We made a mistake and changed the name of the exe file after exporting so now it doesn't run. To run it, you have to change the name of the\u00a0Calendar.exe file to\u00a0berkeley_game_jam_2022.exe</p>\n\n<p>Credits to our team:</p>\n<p>Programming team:</p>\n<ul><li>Jack Liu</li><li>Arthur Facreyn</li><li>Radin Ahmadi</li><li>Leo Jiang</li><li>Casey Stanford</li><li>Daeseo Lee</li><li>Gordon Feliz</li></ul>\n<p>Audio and Sound FX:</p>\n<ul><li>Euan Tandiono</li></ul>\n<p>Art and Graphics:</p>\n<ul><li>Selina Gong</li><li>Devyne</li><li>Ashrita Kantamneni</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca55751449621d023d783843c87c9b8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jackxuanliu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
