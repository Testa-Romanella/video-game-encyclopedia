The player moves through three distinct perspectives: trout, mayfly, and larva.</p><p>This project is, in part, an attempt to subvert anthropocentric representations of non-human avatars. You can read more about the making of the project on A MAZE magazine's Animals issue (page 16-17).</p><p>Thanks to Seth S. Scott for audio work, Karina Popp for the tutorial art, the many friends who have given feedback on the game, and everyone at the NYU Game Center for their help and support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/830c2846df55f3487a28608e900399aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alex Duncan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
