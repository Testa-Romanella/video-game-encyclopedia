Yes, I know, it was bad, I'm really sorry :/)</p><p>Game for MashUp\u00a0Game Jam, made within 72 alone.  You're a farmer who gets money for planting fruits and selling them, but don't get too greedy carelessly: the more crops you have, the more crows come take a bit of your delicious purple oranges! After all, size matters (theme of the jam for those who don't know).</p>\n<p>Although I couldn't do everything I wanted, the game is perfectly functional (as far as I know,\u00a0I playtested it half a dozen times). Anyways, if I'm gonna keep working on it or not only time can tell, but if you insist, maybe I can continue.</p>\n<p>I did this completely alone, all assets are mine (except fonts), made since the jam started. It's not obligatory, but if you could mention me if you use this game somewhere, I'd be really happy :D Anyways, this is my second jam, and I dedicated something around 35 hours on this (and still couldn't do a soundtrack), so I'd love to hear/read what you guys think about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My high score is 240, beat me ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T09:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f00d8a806be4f12b64e7dda79b92ce6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AMS7ED"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
