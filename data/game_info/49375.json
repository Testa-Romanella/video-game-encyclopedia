If you enjoy simple games about flying and speed, look no further! The controls are super intuitive and easy to learn, and there is an endless amount of procedurally generated maps for you to explore.<br/><br/>GrizzlyGames is a very passionate but small team of three students, so please keep that in mind when you think about buying Superflight. It\u2019s not a huge game with hours and hours of content.
