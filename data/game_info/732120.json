The idea of the competition was to create and develop a C64 game, which after compression fits 4096 bytes or lower. This was the first of two entries that were submitted in the competition back in the day.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Playing the game<br/><br/></strong>This is a simple little run around and shoot 'em up. Your task is to help your school boy fight the deadly robots. In order to do this, you have to use a water pistol. Also please be warned that the evil robots will also attempt to capture your pet dog.\u00a0<br/><br/>You will have a limited number of robots to destroy before you move onto the next level. The further you progress into the game, the more tougher the game will become. Can you help your schoolboy save himself (and his pet pooch) from the torment of those rabid robots?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Code and sound effects by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics and design by\u00a0<strong>Alf Yngve</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/>(C)2018 The New Dimension</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da2f2570ed723a9877bf79df57d8f180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
