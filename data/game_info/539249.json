Bring them over to your garden, then drop them (release click) onto the crops. This will kill the enemies you're holding and feed them to the crops they dropped on.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your goal<br/></strong></p>\n<p>On the left of the screen, you'll see a box titled \"Mutation Progress\" - this shows how many crops have been fully grown into each mutation type. You win once all mutation types have reached 100%.</p>\n<p>Note: The \"Mutation Progress\" box also shows\u00a0<strong>\"Speed\"</strong> at the bottom. This is your character's movement speed, which increases when you pick up hearts (dropped by enemies).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Programming by myself</p>\n<p>Music by myself and cats#7175<br/></p>\n<p>Art by cats#7175<br/></p>\n<p>Sfx by myself<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Technical Info<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Programming: Java with the LibGDX framework</p>\n<p>DAW: Reaper<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85eb54eab9329d9c8fa5b93506773769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jordanb84"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
