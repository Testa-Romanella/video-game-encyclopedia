And PIPES. <br/><br/>In this exciting brain game, you have to bring all your intelligence and skill. You need to lead the balls from the machine to the goal cup. Sounds simple, right? It\u2019s not! Because the pipes are disconnected, and it\u2019s up to you to reconnect them in the right way. <br/><br/>Get ready to be tricked, because the levels might contain decoys and obstacles along the way. Only a true pipe master will figure out how to solve these riddles. The more levels you complete (and the fewer balls you lose), the more skins and rewards you can unlock. So you have endless hours ahead of you completing levels, winning treasures, and dropping balls through pipes! <br/><br/>Ball Pipes is 100% free! We believe true skill should be rewarded, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t pay to unlock treasures. What matters to excel in this game are your ball piping skills, not what\u2019s in your wallet! <br/><br/>Go help these balls right now by downloading the game! You won\u2019t regret it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T01:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5ab33d840547fcd704625dfde825878e_Tw5asw8.jpg", "website": "http://popcore.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Popcore"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Popcore"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
