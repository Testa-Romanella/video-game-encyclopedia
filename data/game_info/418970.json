After two days of designing and two weeks of programming a turn based strategy game for the first time, we finally reached the stage of an intractive, but not yet really playable prototype. Some major functionalities such as a turn manager or AI acting as your enemy are still missing. The lessons learned while working on this project are invaluable towards future endeavors.</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>\"Your recently deceased grandfather left behind a heirloom: Your family\u2019s history documented in an old looking book.
