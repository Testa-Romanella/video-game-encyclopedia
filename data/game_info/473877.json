We hope to create very high-quality games, renders, and animations for people to enjoy. We also are looking to expand our team and eventually, hire more animators, coders, etc to speed up production and bring even better content to everyone. With your support, we can grow and become something you truly love to be apart of. We are here for you, so we want to make sure you are getting exactly what you are looking for. Join us on the journey and you won't be disappointed.</p>\r\nOUR CURRENT PROJECT\r\n<p>Our current project is a VN titled, \"Smut Story\". Smut Story is a highly interactive adult VN, about a guy who just got out of college and rents out a room in a house. You need to find a job, and make sure you pay rent on time so you don't get kicked out. From there, it's about what you choose to do inside the game and how you interact. You have the choice of being good, bad, or neutral. How you act and the things you say directly affects the game and goes towards a point system. Becoming fully good or fully bad has its advantages/disadvantages, so choose wisely.<br/><br/>Our goal is to add many new features that you don't see in other games of the genre, and to make sure the player is fully interactable with the story and the characters.<br/><br/><em><strong>The game features characters from different video games, parodied or altered with different names.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<em>\n<p><strong><em>Some Planned Features:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>High-Quality Blender Animated sex scenes with actual sound (and possible voice later). As well as all animated scenes, in general, will have sound.</em></li><li><em>Animated idle renders (so no more just seeing a girl sitting on a couch not moving that you can click on, she'll be moving and doing something).\r\n</em></li><li><em>Good, Neutral, and Bad choice interactions that can change the entire story and not just one line of text. These choices also go towards points, so you can be a bad dude the whole game if you want, and the story and how people interact with you will change.\r\n</em></li><li><em>Ability to buy and change your character's clothes (WIP).\r\n</em></li><li><em>Animated character stats screen.\r\n</em></li><li><em>Actual voice lines (this is a wip, for now the text has a sound effect and moves with the flow of the lines, but can be set faster)\r\n</em></li><li><em>Better interactions in general that are more meaningful every time you speak to someone, with multiple choices.\r\n</em></li><li><em>Animations for most things in general (progress over time).\r\n</em></li><li><em>Change positions during sex scenes (WIP).\r\n</em></li><li><em>Career promotions and rewards.</em></li></ul>\n</em>\n<p>Support<br/>For faster updates/devlogs/community consider joining us on Patreon and Discord.
