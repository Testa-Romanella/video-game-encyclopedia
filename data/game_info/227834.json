These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  <br/><br/>Features: <br/>\u25e6 Connect points by numbers or letters <br/>\u25e6 When points are connected, you will see the silhouette of a hidden picture <br/>\u25e6 Once all the points have been connected, you can color the picture <br/>\u25e6 Choosing a wrong symbol three times in a row will bring up a tip <br/>\u25e6 Blue, orange, green or pink stars make the game even more exciting <br/>\u25e6 Easy-to-use palette that allows you to put together your own unique set of colors <br/>\u25e6 Colored pictures automatically saved on closing the program<br/><br/>Connect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. <br/>Connecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you\u2019ll be able to color it.<br/>Those studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.<br/>The coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff68c85e1f7a9107925c47b4ba2cea91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Kedronic UAB"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
