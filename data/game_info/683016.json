You will play as a bounty hunter travelling from planet to planet looking for missions. Use your money to buy better weapons from traders and explore the galaxy!\u00a0</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>A randomly generated galaxy for each run</li><li>Fancy gun slinging action</li><li>Very minimalist pixels</li></ul>\r\nDeveloper note\r\n<p>The game is far from having all the features it should have, but I sadly could not use all the time that was available during the jam. The HTML version is a little different from the source code, since I\u00a0found out I had accidentally left on some developer settings, but I turned those off. There is no winning condition either, but I\u00a0hope you have fun regardless!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left Mouse - Shoot</li><li>Right Mouse - Aim</li><li>Scroll - Zoom</li><li>WASD - Move<br/>\n</li><li>R - Reload</li><li>Q - Select Weapon Menu</li><li>M - Map</li><li>E - Interact</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2335f23d46c16f142264c3cad355a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hare Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
