Not wanting to be alone in such a dark and frightful place, the wizard applied a spell of illumination (along with a touch of sentience) to his shadow. The further you get from the shadow, the darker the dungeon gets. Stray too far from the shadow, and the darkness will break your spell and consume you both!</p>\n<p>Although your shadow copies your own movements, this dreadful dungeon may force you apart onto different paths! Only you can walk across the glass walls, but your shadow can cling to shadowy platforms alongside you. There are also buttons which might only respond to your or your shadow to create even more platforms! Who knows, in this strange place, you might even end up carrying your own shadow!</p>\n<p>Can you guide the wizard out of the dungeon with the help of his enchanted shadow?</p>\n<p>(This game was made by Meepix and Scarfier\u00a0for the GMTK Game Jam 2021.
