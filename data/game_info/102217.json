No graphics, no menus, no point-and-click \u2014 you navigate a written story using typed commands, and read what happens next.</p>\n<p>Travel to the haunted coastal town of Anchorhead, Massachusetts and uncover the roots of a horrific conspiracy inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Search through musty archives and tomes of esoteric lore; dodge hostile townsfolk; combat a generation-spanning evil that threatens your family and the entire world. A sprawling, meticulously detailed setting, brought to life by finely crafted prose and illustrated with dozens of spine-chilling illustrations, ensures that the story will stay with you long after you finish playing the game.</p>\n<p><em>A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder \u2014 fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.
