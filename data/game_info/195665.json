It's <strong>puzzle adventure game something like Portal</strong>. Of course Portal is far better then mine.<br/></p><p>\r\n\tPlayer(you) is locked in a Maze and she must escape. When enemy's bullet runs toward to the Player, the time will get slower(time-freezing). And only player can move fast(think about Quicksilver from X-Man). Using this ability, you can break the maze. The bullet-time style effect is beautiful and powerful.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhen the time-freezing ability is activated, player can turn back enemy's bullet to them or turn on/off machines. Some people told me this game is difficult. But some other people enjoyed my game. And some guys cleared all the stages of my game. There are 25 stages. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a83/a83aeb3cb6ef00d03218928096edeb8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamyTyper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
