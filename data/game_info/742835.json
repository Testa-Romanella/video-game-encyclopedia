You can do heart transplants in an instant, you're just that efficient.<br/><br/>You love what you do, but the hospitals where you work at aren't too great with their room-layouts. Operating tables are scattered in the buildings. Now you need to not only transplant hearts, but also find the patients!<br/><br/>Anyway, have fun with this silly game.<br/><br/>I interpreted the theme as you as a surgeon only get one heart to make one person better. The original owner of the heart cannot also get a heart to survive. It kindof grew from there and in the end had multiple patients, which doesn't fit the theme as well as it did ;).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861fbefa9ed2abaaa9342b4d2f21c4d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FrozenCow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
