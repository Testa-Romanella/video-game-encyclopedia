We'd be mighty appreciative of your feedback in order to help us debug and make the best Wild West royale around!  <br/><br/><br/>Please note: <br/>- GRIT is currently in Pre-Early Access, and will contain bugs large and small. <br/>- Many features and improvements, from animations to FPS performance to everything in-between are still being worked on and otherwise optimized. <br/>- These playtest releases are not reflective of the final build quality as these versions have not undergone the full QA process.<br/>- Playtests are free.<br/>- We really appreciate you helping us test so earn Beta XP now, which will grant to-be announced bonuses when GRIT releases into Early Access.<br/><br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>This town ain't big enough for the two of us, and it ain't just the two of us looking for a fight. Ride or die in the ultimate Wild West battle royale, where there's more to winning than aiming true.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Saddle up and ride across town, building the best poker hand from found weapons to make a killing. Grab the best shooter to-hand and gun your way to infamy on the new frontier.<br/><br/>Explore the towns, oil fields and plains of the untamed west as you try to hitch a ride on the last man alive train.  But hold on to your 10 gallon hat - it'll protect you as you're shootin' up a storm!<br/><br/>If a gunslinger shoots you down, keep your hat on - a 1v1 Wild West showdown  could put you back in the game if you got a quick draw.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Wild West Royale</strong> -Saddle a trusty horse and venture across the frontier. Face off against gangs of gunslingers and the deadly Calamity in solo, duo, and squad showdowns.<br/><br/><strong>Perk System </strong>-  Look for weapons that build a Flush to gain special perks. Gather specific hands to craft different styles of play.  There's advantages and tradeoffs to be made depending on the cards you're collecting. Will you go all-in on gunslinging, focus on patching up your wounds after each skirmish, or find some other winning combination?<br/><br/><strong>Ride Through the West</strong> -  Bond with your horse, riding and controlling your trusty steed with multiple speeds. Feeling lazy? Use the equine beast o' burden as extra inventory. Horses are a great way to stay mobile, escape the all consuming calamity storm, and fire on-the-go.  If you're feeling daring and have the gumption, steal your foe's horse and ride like the wind. <br/><br/><strong>Tools o' the Trade</strong> - Over 20 weapons and a whole host of cowboy equipment are there to help you and yours to the top of the gunslinger rankings. Weapons are projectile-based, so you\u2019ll need to be a crack shot, lead targets, and account for gravity. <br/><br/><strong>All Aboard</strong> - Steal loot and a seat on the last train outta town. Take charge and use the locomotive to stay inside the battle royale ring.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T17:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be16ade9a0b4b7bc5dd536ced3f3b2d.jpg", "website": "http://grit.gg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team GRIT"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Team GRIT"], "esrb_rating": null}
