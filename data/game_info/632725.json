Actually means.</p>\n<p>The game presents '<strong>Lore Mode</strong>' AKA 'Story Mode',\u00a0as well as several other fun and tricky <strong>mini-games</strong> that you can brag about when and if you complete them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- <strong>Average playtime for the story mode</strong> is 1-2 Days.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Average playtime for the entire game</strong> is about a week. (Those last few mini-games are very tricky!)</p>\n<p>- The default <strong>screen resolution</strong> is 1280x720, and shouldn't be changeable, but if you do find a way to change the resolution, the UI (buttons, images and text) will glitch for 30%\u00a0of the resolutions. If your custom resolution is within that margin, just change the resolution back to 1980x720 :)</p>\n<p>- <strong>If</strong> you <strong>find</strong> <strong>any</strong> <strong>bugs</strong>,\u00a0<em><strong>please</strong>\u00a0</em>tell me (Developer\u00a0Jake) at my business email &gt;&gt; <em><strong>soulringshallcome@gmail.com</strong>\u00a0</em>along with a picture(s)/video(s) of the error.
