Instead of jumping, it switches the direction of gravity to fall from the floor to the ceiling.  Interestingly, it can only do this when it is standing on a surface or has just ran off one.<br/><br/><br/>To conduct my studies, I've formulated cookies that are both irresistible to a Hum and teleport it to the next experiment.<br/><br/>I've also created nanobots to test the subject's intelligence.  These are basic obstacles like a patrolling blade, a falling box, or a quad-directional laser blaster.<br/> <br/>If you can clear all of my experiments, there will be a great reward.<br/><br/>P.S. If you see any hexagonal chips, don't eat them.  Because um... The cookies taste much better!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T02:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc26cbf8a1062404eebc116e6c91ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hunter Hovanec"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hunter Hovanec"], "esrb_rating": null}
