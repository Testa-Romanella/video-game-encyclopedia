Use your brain first and, if necessary, your sledgehammer.<br />\nIn the &#39;50s Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll music was spawned straight from hell and was so evil that it turned dead people into Zombies!<br />\nThree survivors - Jack Foster, a construction worker, Foxy Jones, a traffic warden, and Mike Bacon, a perpetually hungry boy scout - have formed an unlikely alliance to protect themselves from the invading undead. Hiding in abandoned buildings, they build blockades, set traps and - as a last resort - use weapons to fight the Zombies.<br />\nOutlive the Zombie invasion alone or fight with your friends in split-screen cooperative mode.<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
