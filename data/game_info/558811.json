So every time you shoot you lose an amount of health. To restore health you can either shoot enemies or find energy packs scattered around the map.\u00a0\u00a0The combat is fast paste and challenges you with a variety of enemies and map layouts. So running is not always the best option. Gunning is the way to go most of the time.</p>\n<p>The game will be FREE since this is a small team of only 4 members and its gonna be the first fully developed game by us. So don't miss out any updates in the game dev log if you're interested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6fe7a85c7e8184a38bb3fa2b479ad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PolarisGamedevs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
