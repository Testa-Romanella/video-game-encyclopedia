Our first Ludum Dare is over and we are more than happy to present our game: 404: Space not found. Finishing with lots of bug fixes during the last hours we were a little worried of not doing it in time, but here we are, finished (for now)! To sum it up, we had an awesome jam, learned a lot and will definitely join the next LD.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are in space. As an interstellar delivery boy/girl, you gain control about a fleet of spaceships. During your normal working day you transport all kinds of goods to various planets and space-bases. As time passes traffic picks up and you start to run out of space... Watch out for your competitors, even if you don`t like them. Plan your routes carefully. Otherwise you might crash!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>LMB is the only control needed!</p>\n\n<p>Shoutouts to \"Vault Kid\", for the great sound design:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/iamVaultKid<br/></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/vaultkid<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f83f8974460bc955b3aaf6abfbeedb9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Squall413"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
