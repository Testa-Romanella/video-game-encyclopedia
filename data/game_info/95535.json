Check your health!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a demake to Game Boy style of the game Justice Bear: Equinox, available on Google Play Store and justicebear.com (and here in itch.io!). It took me way more time than expected to make the original game, as I couldn't find the time after work, so the GBJam was the perfect chance to prove to myself I could do something playable in just a few days (more like hours ^^;). Thanks for trying it and I hope you enjoy it. And now, the typical store description, bear with me:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Bearnard and his family are enjoying the Spring Festival, the peaceful village of Amber Town is suddenly invaded by an unknown army. With just seconds to react, young Bearnard decides to draw their attention to give time to his family to hide. Help him cross the town while it's reduced to ashes, avoiding bombs and debris, and jumping across broken streets and fire pits.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFeatures:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u2605 Easy controls, just press one button and jump. You can use up, space or the left button of your mouse. But be careful with the timing!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u2605 Power ups to help you avoid the void.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u2605 Classic graphics, sounds and music with an old school Game Boy style.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e830ed65592f3fe05b0b7aa1e538a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["CR\u00d8SS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
