Set on a hex map filled with diverse terrains, this operational-level strategy game presents a real high quality window into games of the past, with challenging battles, engaging character voice overs, and a competent AI opponent. <br/><br/>Battles take place on a hexagonal map and are regulated by our complex proprietary tactical simulation system \"Archangelus\" which for each clash considers multiple factors such as terrain, ZOCs (zones of control), morale, orientation, the combat fronts, the offensive and defensive power and the specific typology of each unit. <br/><br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of each battle you can deploy units that each represent hundreds of soldiers, but there are also unique units such as heroes and dragons. Each unit is similar in structure to a classic role-playing game character, with distinct characteristics and special abilities that can be improved by levelling them up thanks to the accumulation of experience points on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The plot unfolds within four compelling campaigns narratively linked to each other. In the role of a valiant general who finds himself in the midst of a devastating war that has broken out for unknown reasons, you will receive messages from Emperor Karl and the Grand Council of Mages that will guide you to discover a mysterious enemy plotting in the shadows.<br/><br/>Alongside you stand three mighty Heroes representing Humans, Elves, and Dwarves, ready to assist in your trials, challenges, and triumphs. Explore the great Empire of Adamantia, invaded by the forces of Kaos, and venture into mysterious uncharted lands as you seek victory and freedom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each campaign consists of multiple battles with primary and secondary objectives of escalating difficulty. As you progress, you'll unlock victory levels determined by completing objectives within time limits, with \"Epic\" Victories making you richer and more famed. Achieving higher levels rewards you with gold, fame points, and various benefits such as unit upgrades, resurrection of fallen troops, new powers, and expanded recruitment options. Visit the encampment after battles to level up your army.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lead your troops strategically by deploying them before each battle, considering facing and movement options. Engage in melee and ranged combat, utilizing spells and missile weapons to gain an edge. With 32 special abilities, 32 spells, and six different races, the tactical possibilities are vast. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Remember that you can only move one unit at a time, and combat follows a strictly symmetrical turn-based approach. Adapt to these constraints and overcome the scripted challenges that lie ahead.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Complex Battle System incorporating various tactical factors<br/></li><li>Immersive storyline inspired by European medieval traditions and fantasy narratives<br/></li><li>Four single-player campaigns with 25 epic battles, heroes, enemy generals, and side quests<br/></li><li>Over 70 unique units to recruit, upgrade, and unleash upon the battlefield<br/></li><li>RPG-like units with customizable stats and abilities<br/></li><li>Powerful spells to wield and hordes of enemies to face</li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363700/Eukarion_Tales_2/<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2482360/Eukarion_Tales_Origins/<br/><br/><strong>Developer Note: </strong><br/><br/>This game is part of AgeofGames list of re-released videogame artifacts, developed by a small indie team using the full potential and limitations of development technology now phased out of use.
