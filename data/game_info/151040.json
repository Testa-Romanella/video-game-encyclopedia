{"id": 151040, "slug": "featherrock", "name": "FEATHERROCK", "name_original": "FEATHERROCK", "description": "<p><em>FEATHERROCK</em> is a game I created for Ludum Dare 32 where the theme was An Unconventional Weapon. It was created with:</p><ul><li>Luxe</li><li>PyxelEdit</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Bosca Ceoil</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Sublime Text 3</li></ul>in the space of [less than] 48 hours in April of 2015. This was my first time using Luxe to create anything of consequence, and although the engine is still very much in alpha, it's pretty solid and I actually had a fair bit of fun programming with it!<p>Before I started, I swore I wouldn't let the programming get out of hand and that I would spend more time on art and level design this time. That turned out to be a total pipe dream! I spent too long on programming (as usual) and nowhere near enough time on level design and art. I did manage to make a neat little introductory cinematic however, so that was nice.</p><p>That said, I'm actually really proud of the mechanic and the \"feel\" of the game. I might end up fleshing this out a bit more when I have some time. Though I would definitely remove or heavily modify the timer mechanic, as most people did not like that one bit (which, fair enough.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d965e673b654c695546b2e5e04760ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlazingMammothGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
