Therefore, the development continued!</p>\r\nGreenlight campaign\r\n<p>On August 28th 2015 StevenHarmonGames put Ultra Dance Murder on Greenlight in order to have a chance at getting the game published on Steam. It didn't get enough votes yet, but nevertheless you can still vote now for the new rebuilt game!</p>\r\nPresent\r\n<p>The game's greenlight was a learning experience in marketing and is currently in a sort of limbo. The game was put on hold for some time. However, January of 2016 Steven decided to scrap all progress made on udm up to that point and remake the game better than originally envisioned. The remake of the game is now expected to release by Spring of 2017.
