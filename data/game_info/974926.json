You will have to explore spaces that are hard to believe exist. It's hard to say who could have built such a thing and why.  There are eight different levels available for you to explore. Each level of this otherworld is fraught with danger, and no matter what surreal place you find yourself in, you have only one goal - to survive and find a way out. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>One of the few descriptions we know of this mysterious place reads - \"If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you..\"</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>In Backrooms you do need to be careful. Remember that you're just a guest here and you definitely shouldn't disturb the inhabitants of this place. The deeper you go into the backstage, the more creepy dangers will come your way.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Graphics, sounds, post effects, as well as character and entity animations are as close as possible to the original \"Backrooms Found Footage\" videos. All these visual solutions create the atmosphere of a realistic journey through the backstage.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T08:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf6b72fbfae56a288f9b01c9cda61f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Performance Artist"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Performance Artist"], "esrb_rating": null}
