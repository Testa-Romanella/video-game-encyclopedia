They were linked from my Dropbox but I think that Dropbox may have messed up the data, so I just uploaded them straight from my HD.  Hopefully they will work this time.</p><p><strong>(2nd!) November 15th UPDATE</strong> - Well, something isn't working, with the Mac file, at least.  Hopefully you PC users out there are having fun killing ward rats by now... sorry Apple fans!  Not sure what to do.  I'll tackle this another day.</p><p><strong>November 16th UPDATE</strong> - Trying again by re-deploying the games and re-compressing them... figured what I did by directly deploying them into Dropbox might have screwed up the data.  Hopefully this is the answer!</p><p><strong>(2nd!) November 16th UPDATE</strong> - A PC user reported that the game functioned for him.  No news yet about how the Mac version is faring for others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb07686c98b93f92f69ddee501c0c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AsylumSquad"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
