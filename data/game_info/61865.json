Each delivered cargo can become a real trial. You must prepare your truck for the ride and estimate everything correctly \u2013 your route or how much gas you will need. <br/>\r\nThere is no place for cry babies here \u2013 this is a job for real men, therefore in the basic mode there are no navigators, no cameras flying after the truck and similar arcade gimmickry. How quickly you can deliver the cargo and park your truck depends exclusively on your skill. You will eventually be rewarded by universal respect and recognition of the others.<br/>\r\nIf you are ready for the trial, pick up the keys, get behind the wheel and show what you can do!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame features:<br/>\r\n-A huge open world! 100 square kilometers of scenery, more than 20 kilometers of roads!<br/>\r\n- Absolutely realistic movements of the truck and the trailer.<br/>\r\n- Disassemble your truck and reassemble it the way you like. <br/>\r\n- Buy buildings<br/>\r\n- Buy vehicles<br/>\r\n- Employ staff<br/>\r\n- Create your own cargo traffic company", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ecf2528007ed4acea4aeff82654a4ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Another world"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Another world"], "esrb_rating": null}
