On the left side, turtle babies will hatch from their eggs and start crawling towards the ocean. From the top and bottom seagulls will spawn periodically over time that want to eat the turtles.</p>\n<p>You can defend the turtles by building sand towers along their path. Towers are occupied by other crabs and have different kinds of projectiles or waves that will work as auto turrets for you. Towers can also be upgraded to further improve their efficiency and effectiveness.\u00a0For building and upgrading towers you need seashells which you earn by defeating seagulls. If you misplaced a tower or need space you can also destroy them which will give you their initial cost back.</p>\n<p>Additionally you can also detach and throw your own claw as a boomerang to attack seagulls yourself.</p>\n<p>If a seagull reaches a turtle, it will grab it and try to fly away with it. Once the seagull reaches the top or bottom border, the turtle is lost for good.\u00a0If you defeat the seagull before it can escape, the turtle will drop and continue crawling.</p>\r\nWin condition\r\n<p>You win the game if you manage to keep the majority of the baby turtles alive. If more than\u00a030 turtles die you lose the game.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTower types\r\n<p>The following tower types can be built:</p>\n<strong>Urchin Tower</strong><strong>Conch Tower</strong><strong>5G Tower</strong><strong>Umbrella Tower</strong>S<strong>eastar Tower</strong><strong>Bucket Tower</strong>Throws urchins that attach to seagulls and deal small amount of damage multiple times.The sound of this majestic conch slows down all seagulls in its range.Creates shock waves that deal damage to all surrounding seagulls over time.Shoots an umbrella over large distances.
