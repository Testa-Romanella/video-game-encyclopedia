The game has an original design and interaction system,\r\nbut some ideas for the elements had to be taken from other \r\nsources. However, each element is implemented in its own way \r\nand I think you will like it. In total there are 72 elements \r\nin the game, but there are also 7 additional elements in the\r\ngame for the author's friends.\r\nIn total, 2 months were spent on the development of the game, \r\nand I hope not in vain\r\nList of all available features:\r\n1.
