Essentially, in order to allocate processes to the RAM, you drag the processes from the process list to a free space slot in the RAM. If you see that you have enough total free space in the RAM if you add up all the free slots, but each slot does not fit a certain process, you may choose to do \"Compaction!\" to group all the free slots together into one huge block, which hopefully fits the process that needs it.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any feedback into the comments below! Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f23f8e0b451b49de1b3bb396e63b1cdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jayzonty"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
