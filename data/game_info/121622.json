Meeting Arith, a weird man inside the woods, it is your decisions that decide what will happen.<br/></p>\n<p>At best, you will have a nice trip. At worst, it will be your last day on earth.</p>\n<p>And if you watch your words, you might actually come to accept the things you refused to acknowledge. And finally set things right again.</p>\n\n<p>Denial is a short game (10-20 minutes, depending on your reading speed) that has a number of branching paths. Explore the different possibilities to find out other things and maybe the single right path to the true happy ending. Hints and walkthrough are included under \"What is Denial\" in case you need help.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any bugs or are having trouble, feel free to talk to me :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816a425fc3bda33836401fd88ac45fe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MaliGarnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
