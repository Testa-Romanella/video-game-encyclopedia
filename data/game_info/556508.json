Diagnosing prosopagnosia was a fairly challenging process for me, despite having a very obvious case. And even after official diagnosis, I have had neurologists call me fakers to my face, while holding the diagnostic paperwork in their hands.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game kind of is based on the question from philosophy: what decides that I am sick or if I am sick? Me? The doctor? What does sickness even mean, if it's in the ICD? Or is it enough if I feel bad? Why bother with labels/diagnoses for conditions that have no treatment available?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well at least for that last part I have a few answers. For one, in most societies you cannot get any state benefits for a disability if you have not been diagnosed with a disability. You can have a broken back and be fully irreversibly paralyzed, but unless it's on paper, you are officially able bodied. And even then, it is not uncommon for the state to come and bother you about needing to prove, again, that your back wasn't magically healed over the last year. If you do not bow to that demand, you will loose the support you need to survive. It is a gross power imbalance and it even can lead to mental health issues from stress of navigating being chronically\u00a0ill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made based on this Unity tutorial for making a Flappy Bird style game in Unity.\u00a0Idea, art assets and writing from me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f08927189a32a1b444b0af89021b31f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["singingstranger"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
