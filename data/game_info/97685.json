It's an exploration game about discovering things in a moonlight fantasy world. There is a light puzzle element involving herding some sun sprites into portals, but you're free to just explore and discover all the little interactions hidden throughout the world.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 32, and the theme was Unconventional Weapon. We didn't quite get the theme right, the unconventional weapon is the crystals you find on the plants around you, but it's a bit of a stretch. Our main aim was to create a dreamy atmosphere, and to give the player lots of little secrets to discover.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Mouse \u2013 You will move always towards the mouse cursor, but you can hold the left mouse button to move faster. When you have 2 crystals, pressing the right mouse button will start creating a portal and pressing it again will finish creating the portal.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Gamepad \u2013 Use the left stick to move around, and hold down right trigger to move faster. The A button will start creating a portal and pressing it again will finish creating the portal.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe yellow sun sprites are quite hard to herd into the portals, if you're having trouble then try creating a portal around a purple plant, as touching this plant will cause all the sun sprites nearby to fly towards it.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/66600a01a2589eefcbb37da6a5a965ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
