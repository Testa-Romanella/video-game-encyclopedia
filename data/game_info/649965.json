Download the game for best performance and experience!\r\nSpider Game\r\nDescription\r\n<p>This is a first demo for my little spider game where you control a procedurally animated spider that can climb on all surfaces, even upside down. Duh, it's a spider. \ud83d\udd77</p>\n<p>I will continue to work on this little prototype and add more features and mechanics over time. So please don't be to negative if there is not much to do in the game right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The final game should fall in the cozy game genre, which means there should be no combat involved. I want people to have a fun adventure with a cute little spider, because why not. \ud83d\ude09</p>\r\nCurrent\u00a0Features\r\n<p>In the current version of the game you can only walk and climb around in a rather small area, which will increase over time.</p>\n<p>You also have the ability to jump (Space) with the option of a more precise jump when holding down the right mouse button to aim better.</p>\n<p>So, your goal is to just explore this little island and if you are interested, leave a comment with feedback. I'm looking forward to any bugs you find (there are quite a few at the moment) and of course ideas that would make the game more fun in the future. You can leave a comment below or contact me on Twitter @FireTotemGames.</p>\n<p>No Gamepad support yet.</p>\r\nControls\r\nWASD\u00a0Character movementShift\u00a0Sprint (a little bit at least)Mouse\u00a0Camera movementMouse wheelCamera zoomSpace\u00a0JumpRight mouse buttonAim Mode (better precision for jumping)1-7 keys and F keyEmotesRRespawnGToggle Grass\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li><strong>Sebastian Uitz (https://twitter.com/FireTotemGames)</strong>\u00a0- Project Management, Game Design, and\u00a0Programming</li><li><strong>Michael Steinkellner (https://www.merlinnsound.com/)</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Music and Sound Effects</li></ul>\r\nChange History\r\n<strong>Version</strong><strong>Date</strong><strong>Comment</strong>0.114.08.2021First demo including climbing and jumping mechanics", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed6bb45183129051e2be02f9817ddbf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["FireTotemGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
