And only one ace pilot stands in their way:</p>\n<p><strong>STRATO RUNNER...</strong></p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>This is a prototype of a bullet-hell shooter I'm working on, with a 16-bit retro aesthetic. Right now, only the first level is included, and a few features (like settings) aren't yet functional. This demo includes 7 different enemies, tons of waves, and a boss.</p>\n<p>------------<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: mouse to move, space to fire, and A for shields. Pick up coins to refill your shield. Currently you can't rebind controls, but that will be added in future releases.</p>\n<p>------------<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming, graphics: me</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0Coder's Crux by Andrew McCluskey</p>\n<p>HLSL RNG function:\u00a0Keijiro Takahashi</p>\n<p>Music: Supernatural (Alex Beroza), Drive Fast (Three Chain Links), Andrew Anime (urmymuse)</p>\n\n<p>Give it a download!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e7/1e73c3dbd101ba5ae415c734865bce9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jonsm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
