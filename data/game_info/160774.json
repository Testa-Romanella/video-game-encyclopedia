The original concept had tight ship controls, but I think making the movement more momentum-based makes it more interesting.</p>\n<p>This is yet another game made from the same <strong>Unity course</strong> as most of my other games: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, because I was following along in Unity 5, and this section of the course was taught in Unity 4, a TON of the methods demonstrated to do certain things got lost in translation, and I needed to come up with my own methods for doing about 50-60% of all the coding. So actually, this game is more mine than most of the other minigames I've made.</p>\n<p>All sound effects were made using <strong>BFXR</strong>: http://www.bfxr.net/</p>\n<p>Music is <strong>\"Let's Apocalypse Later\"</strong> by <strong>Artofescapism</strong> via <strong>Free Music Archive</strong>: http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Artofescapism_1629/Arena_Electronic_Music/Apoc...<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a0310bfa0a29942b35a0b528afc53cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karbenstein"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
