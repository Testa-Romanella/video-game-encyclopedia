Unfortunately my artistic skills are not much to speak of, and the Demo is definitely missing a lot (including some BGM and sounds), but I hope you'll still be able to enjoy the little gameplay loop I've put together!</p>\n<p>My hope is to be able to continue updating this project in the following month or two, and then move on to create more small projects akin to this one.</p><p>Trello Board if you're interested to know about what I'm currently working on, and what future features I've planned!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d2748b001967445fd8ff65f64b4e8200.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zampa"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
