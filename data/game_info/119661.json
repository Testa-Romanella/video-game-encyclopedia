They argue that games development is hard, can I do better \u2013 in seven days?\" Whilst I will leave judgement to you, I have taken my skills in programming and basic skills in modelling and music composition and produced an indie horror game in just seven days and, despite bugs, I am fairly pleased with the game. Also, I could not use pre-bought game engine assets but I could use royalty free sounds and images (the work of over 50 other people is in this game).</p>Possible Questions<p>Length: Between 5 to 7 minutes.<br/><br/>Bugs: Yes, lots of bugs, although there should be nothing game breaking \u2013 the Unity engine has helped a long way in not allowing these bug occur.<br/>Performance: If The game seems to run at a very high framerate with no performance issues.<br/><strong>Isn't this like a game jam? </strong>Yes.<br/>Any respectful asks? I'd respectfully ask that you put a link of the game in the description if you make a video or some other form of content around this. Also, it was built in seven days, don't expect exactly amazing puzzle design or animation quality \u2013 especially given that I had no real prior experience with the Unity engine, modelling, texturing or animations.</p><p>Should be a good laugh. </p><p>I might update the game with a new version to fix any critical bugs - this will be clearly labelled as made outside of the initial seven days.</p>My Links<p>YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCviO-m6wi9zv1qp7J...<br/>Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/XancoGaming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f15efc391cda42295e1ddc6873482b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xanco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
