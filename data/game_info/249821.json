But as Mr. Tulip Head always says \"Zet hem op\" - you can do this.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing with a mouse over trackpad is recommended.<br/></strong>All of the instructions are covered during the game, but in case Mr. Tulip Head is on coffee break and you need a refresher.</p>\n<p><strong>Left Click</strong> - Place selected tile.<br/><strong>Right Click </strong>- Pick up tile: tiles that can not be picked up are slightly lower and grayed out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathway:</strong>\u00a0Must connect to each other. Must make a clear path from gate A to gate B without breaking.<br/><strong>Tulip:\u00a0</strong>The most charming plant, tulips score 1 charm for each\u00a0<strong>adjacent\u00a0</strong>path tile. Additional bulbs act as a multiplier for a tulip's charm score.<br/><strong>Water:\u00a0</strong>Must be placed near an already existing water tile. Water helps tulips grow:\u00a0one bulb for each\u00a0surrounding water tile.</p>\n<p>Tulips can grow up to three bulbs on a single tile.<br/><strong>Statues:\u00a0</strong>Not as narcissistic as they look. Cannot be placed near another statue and must be spread out.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This is my third game for my jam-a-month project. It was a week long jam (9 days) that\u00a0at times felt more like a weak, long jam. This game\u00a0is inspired by working with my father building and improving\u00a0his garden. It is a lot of fun making small gradual improvements to something with someone you care about and\u00a0eventually looking back and seeing the\u00a0big change at the end. I\u00a0hope that translated well into the design and you can enjoy that feeling with me.</p>\n<p>As always the project is developed in Unity and all graphics and code\u00a0 are made from scratch.\u00a0Music is by John Leonard French -\u00a0purchased under the \"Ultimate Game Music Collection\" from the Unity Asset Store.
