You're John Bishop, a swamped-with-work detective who tirelessly carries out your investigations late into the night. But tonight you are pulled from your precious few hours of rest, and a strange dream, by a mysterious call from an old \u201cfriend.\u201d Turning your fight to find the truth into a fight to survive the night.<br/><br/>Your police department is left without electricity. The security system has been hacked. All exits are locked. But that is not the real problem.<br/>Someone\u2026 something is following you. Red eyes shine from dark corners and the sound of shifting, clanking metal echoes through the once-safe halls. You know them simply as animatronics, but something unknown and horrifying is driving them. Figure out what is going on, survive the night, and remember - no one will care if you scream.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T06:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b73617b363b35b7f750847d724284c6b_6jkunw0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Walnut"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["VALNAT, OOO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
