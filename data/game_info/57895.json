Manage resources, unlock new job classes and uncover powerful relics to become renowned through out the land of Tevalles.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Chrono Clash is a tactics RPG with a unique turn-based system that uses time as a resource. Powerful skills may deal higher damage but take longer to recover from leaving the user open to attack. <br/><br/>Move about the battlefield to flank enemies (or attack them from behind) and deal critical strikes. But beware, that aggressive positioning could leave you in a vulnerable position as well.<br/><br/>Choose from up to 24 job classes (currently 14): classics like the Knight and Mage as well as new unique ones like the Dark Templar and Artificer. Equipment and skills can also be mixed and matched creating hundreds of tactical options.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/80334d366893f958444873ca4c4039ef.jpg", "website": "https://gamenami.com/game/chronoclash", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "iOS"], "developers": ["Gamenami Pte", "Tyler Projects"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Gamenami Pte", "Tyler Projects"], "esrb_rating": null}
