{"id": 437149, "slug": "genderfluid-tightrope-protoype-demo-1", "name": "Genderfluid Tightrope - Protoype Demo 1", "name_original": "Genderfluid Tightrope - Protoype Demo 1", "description": "<p>After multiple discussions with so many other non-binary, trans, genderfluid and other gender-nonconforming individuals about the lack of representation and normalization of our respective gender identities, I figured I started working on this project. After 8 total hours (over the span of two weeks, battling with issue), this is the playable demo.<br/><br/>It's a simple game about a genderfluid, nonbinary person who goes shopping for their \"normal\" family during a pandemic, walking the genderfluid tightrope, avoiding gender dysphoria.<br/></p><p>-------------------<br/><br/>Controls and explanation of the game are included in the game, but just in case something goes wrong:<br/>WASD to move (W is up, A is left, D is right, S is down), R to restart the level, Escape to close the game. Grab all the pickup items (little + cubes) without tipping the meter too far on either sides. Check out. Leave the shop.<br/></p><p>-------------------<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I'm not an authority on gender identity. I'm not an expert. Just someone with a lot of personal experience on the subject. I hope this oversimplification of that experience will help someone, somewhere, realize it's okay to be themselves. Have fun.<br/><br/>This prototype/demo is free, always will be even if I finish the project, and any donations I'll receive will be put into completing this project and feeding myself. If you feel like this game's message might help someone, please feel free to share it!</p><p>-------------------</p><p>Known thing: The meter's flag pattern is the nonbinary flag, not the genderfluid flag, as this project was initially about nonbinarity in general. I'm going leave it as is, as the character is both, but I will change it if I'm asked about it enough.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2c2572476d6c554a1ce639ab5c7caa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["enbyrielle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
