{"id": 552438, "slug": "gravity-reversed", "name": "Gravity Reversed", "name_original": "Gravity Reversed", "description": "<p>The idea is simple, you are in a world where gravity is reversed and the smaller you are the stronger the gravity will pull you to the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Controls: W/A/S/D or arrow keys.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the game is to survive as long as possible by eating the yellow dots and get the highest score you can. By eating them you will get bigger and the gravity will pull you less and less. Make sure you do not use all of your energy or you will not be able to move anymore and you will get sucked into the gravity void.</p>\n<p>Game made in about 3-4 hours for the Blackthorn Prod #3\u00a0Game Jam. If I\u00a0had more time I\u00a0would have added some UI and some more features as well as a bit more polished mechs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5a76d8e53a7c8fbd4b682e4bdf56f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MONSTA Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
