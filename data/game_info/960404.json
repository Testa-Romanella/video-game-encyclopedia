It happens.<br/><br/>Now there\u2019s a new reality, a world between worlds: The Bast.</strong><br/><br/>Remnants of the Rift is a roguelite tactics game where you can play, pause, and plan. You are Morgan, dimension-diving merc, delving deeper and deeper into The Bast at the request of the factions looking to exploit this new reality.<br/><br/>But you\u2019re going to need help to survive in the depths. Help, and a whole lot of skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Remnants of the Rift combines the tactics of grid-based strategy with the thrills of an action game. Each level plays out in real time, but you can pause the game to assess the battlefield, prep your attacks and plan your next move. Use mods and equipment to enhance your preferred style of play and overcome your interdimensional foes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Every dive is different: change your strategies on the fly to counter a dimension in flux. Study each of the procedurally-generated battles and adapt to by customizing your playstyle to defeat all enemies and reap the bountiful rewards. But don\u2019t worry, death isn\u2019t the end. So head home, re-equip, and dive back in.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You\u2019re not alone on your journey into The Bast. As a mercenary, you\u2019ll deal with close associates and vying factions: everyone wants a piece of this new reality. But going deeper means getting better, and you\u2019ll have to create unlikely alliances to procure the equipment you need to explore further.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1656050/Remnants_of_the_Rift/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T05:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49ed9ff5a66abd23013aa68d3591204.jpg", "website": "https://www.bromio.com.mx/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bromio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bromio"], "esrb_rating": null}
