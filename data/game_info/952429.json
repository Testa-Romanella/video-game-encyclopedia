The temperature of the ocean is rising, and you have to help the environment to survive as long as possible.<br/><br/>Every friendly fish that reaches the goal line on the right of the screen earns you Heart Points, which fill your Heart Meter (bottom of screen). But invasive species (red animals) will do the opposite,\u00a0and pollution (dark spheres) will cause the ocean temperature to rise more rapidly, which will make the game end faster.\u00a0<br/><br/>When you get enough points, you can buy items that help you: e.g., the 'net' item will trap invasive species and the 'sweep' item will remove pollution. The bubbles will serve as a guide to let you know something disappeared.<br/><br/>The longer you can keep the ocean healthy, the higher your score is at the end!<br/>And, if you haven't spent all your points, that's your bonus :)</p>\n<p>----<br/><br/>Thank you for trying Love Love Ocean. It's a proof of concept and work in progress made for the Aalto Games Now!
