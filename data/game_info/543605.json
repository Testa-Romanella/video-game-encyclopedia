This tech demo was built as a learning experience for working with the Steam API to use in future projects and there is no further development planned. The project includes a lobby system, Steam friend compatibility, and Steamworks relay feature that allows a player to host a game without having to port forward their router or reveal their IP to other players.<br/><br/>The game involves players building structures with resources to spawn different kinds of tanks to destroy enemy structures. Be the last player with a base standing to win! (Up to 4 players)<br/><br/>To play the current version of the game, register the CStrat executable as a game in your steam library and invite your friends who have done the same using the steam friends list.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3a19f1f4e64d78400ae6f619ed0c7e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gonnzo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
