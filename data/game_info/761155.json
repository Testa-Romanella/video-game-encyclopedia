Just hit the auto-throw button (North Button on Gamepad | Spacebar on Keyboard).<br/><br/><strong>Controls Recommend: <br/>Gamepad Controls\u00a0</strong>(Xbox layout) //\u00a0<em>Only able to test with an Xbox controller\u00a0<br/></em><strong>D Pad</strong>\u00a0| Movement\u00a0<br/><strong>A</strong>\u00a0| Jump\u00a0<br/><strong>X</strong>\u00a0| Throw Lasso (8 direction)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0<em>can bounce off of it twice until grounded again or hitting a swing\u00a0<br/></em><strong>X Again\u00a0</strong>| If the lasso is out you can recall it by hitting X again\u00a0<br/><strong>Y</strong>\u00a0| Auto-Throw (you'll see a reticle if you're in range and no wall is in your way)<br/><strong>B</strong>\u00a0| Bullrush (dash)\u00a0<br/><strong>RB/RT</strong>\u00a0| Shield (hold up to shield above, RB/RT\u00a0again to put it away)</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls</strong>\u00a0<br/><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0| Movement\u00a0<br/><strong>J</strong>\u00a0| Jump\u00a0<br/><strong>K\u00a0</strong>| Throw Lasso (8 direction) \u2014 c<em>an bounce off of it twice until grounded again or hitting a swing</em>\u00a0<br/><strong>K Again\u00a0</strong><em>| If the lasso is out you can recall it by hitting J again</em>\u00a0<br/><strong>Space</strong>\u00a0| Auto-Throw\u00a0(you'll see a reticle if you're in range and no wall is in your way)<br/><strong>L</strong>\u00a0| Bullrush\u00a0<br/><strong>H</strong>\u00a0| Shield (hold up to shield above, press Space again to put it away)\u00a0<br/><em>In Case You Encounter Any Bugs:</em>\u00a0<br/><strong>R</strong>\u00a0| Restart Room\u00a0<br/><strong>Hold Shift and press R</strong>\u00a0| Restart Game\r\n</p>\n<p>As Lasso the Cowboy Bull you'll bullrush through levels filled with killer cacti and treacherous jumps as you bounce off your lasso to pull off acrobatic stunts beyond the ability of any other bovine.\r\n</p>\n<p>Originally made for GDKO, a game jam tournament hosted by\u00a0Xanderwood.
