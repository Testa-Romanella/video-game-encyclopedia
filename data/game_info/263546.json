You are playing as a rocket pilot, and you are doing what a pilot should do: advancing in the expedition, collecting alien artifacts, planning your adventure route and maintaining the rocket. Challenges in six planets with unique landscapes and environments await.<br/><ul><li><strong>Exploration</strong><br/>Six planets are all with their unique features. The planet covered by lava can easily burn the rocket, and the one full of magnetic field can drive the rocket into a deadly zone. With careful piloting, well-organized exploration strategy and good knowledge of the planet, you could become the historical universe explorer.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Rocket transforming</strong><br/>With sufficient energy, the high-tech rocket can transform into the Float Mode. This anti-gravity and stable controlling mode enables the rocket to perform accurate movement to pass narrow gap or suspend in a strong force-field. Right timing of activating the Float Mode is always the key to success.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>You are not alone</strong><br/>You are not alone in the universe. Those floating capsules are the supplies left by other explorers and get them for your own advantage.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Alien artifacts</strong><br/>The Alien Gears made with mysterious glowing materials are hidden in the universe. Collecting them and then forging them into useful machine parts can hugely boost the rocket.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Upgrade</strong><br/>A bundle of upgrade options are in your own hand. You can improve the durability, shield power, environmental resistance and even the Float Mode. Enjoy the DIY for your own rocket.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5ad2f6b389db4782a922df29ce2272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ge Yin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ge Yin", "Y.L.Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
