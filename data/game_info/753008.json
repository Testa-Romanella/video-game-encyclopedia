So ask your friends to join or check in the game's discord link to find teammates.<br/><br/><strong>Bugs?\u00a0Hopefully not many!</strong></p>\n<p>Of course we went for the no-no route of multiplayer, please be gentle with the bugs you may encounter on the way\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Copy Room ID does not work</strong></p><p>Yep, we spent time creating that beautiful button in a combination of Unity externs and Javascript for nothing, we didn't anticipate it was not going to work here in Itchio :(</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial and How To Play</strong><br/><br/>One player is the Alien Shadow and the rest are the survivors in a space station.<br/><br/>The Shadow should \"touch\" all the survivors to deactive their lights and leave them in the darkness. If all the suvivors are deactivated, the Shadow wins.<br/><br/>Survivors should turn on all the interrupters and open the exit to the escape pods.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Team</strong><br/><br/>- KiwiArgo:\u00a0\u00a0programming, level design and Unity things<br/>- Chernita : UI design and illustrations<br/>- Zathmell: 3D art, texturing and animations<br/>- DarkThrone: Music and additional Javascript and webserver support\u00a0<br/>- Eritrocito: Lots of testing, reporting and searching for friend to have playtest sessions during the week.<br/><br/>Everyone participated in game design!<br/><br/><strong>Development</strong><br/><br/>We created this game for the UDC Jam 21 using Unity (of course :P) and Photon for the multiplayer.
