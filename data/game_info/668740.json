With Pumpkin Planner 2021, you'll be able to practice in a safe virtual environment surrounded by the calming sounds and atmosphere of autumn. Sit down, get out your knife, and start\u00a0carving!</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0:<br/></p>\n<p>Use the marker/eraser\u00a0to plan your design.\u00a0The marker can be used\u00a0on the outside shell of the\u00a0pumpkin and will glow when\u00a0placed under blacklight. Use the carving tools to\u00a0shape your pumpkin. Each\u00a0tool digs a little deeper\u00a0than the previous tool.</p>\n<p>Use the recycling sign\u00a0to restart your design.\u00a0There is no undo button.<br/>Use the note to change\u00a0the volume of music/SFX. Use the moon/sun to switch\u00a0between night and day. Use the camera to save an\u00a0image of your pumpkin in\u00a0your Documents folder.</p>\n<p>Once you're happy with the\u00a0design of your pumpkin, use the candle toggle to\u00a0illuminate your pumpkin. Use the blacklight toggle\u00a0to show the spooky maker\u00a0lines you've left behind.
