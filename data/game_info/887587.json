There are multiple special powers to collect and in a bit metroidvania style world exploration.</p>\n<p>Overall the game is relatively small. But I am happy with the result, even if it is a bit bare bones.</p>\n<p>There is no music. I didn't get to add the theme of the jam (which is optional, but will cost me score, I know).</p>\n<p>NOTE: The web version seems to have some focus bug. You need to click to a different window and then back to the game before keyboard input works.</p>\n<p>Both keyboard and controller should be supported. Keybindings can be customized from the options.</p>\n<p>Keys:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys: Move</li><li>[Space]/[Z]: Jump</li><li>[X]:\u00a0Action (depending on dino)</li><li>[Shift]: Mount/unmount</li><li>[Tab]: Switch power</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T12:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89d/89daef73046a43282da2211b755f833a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["daid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
