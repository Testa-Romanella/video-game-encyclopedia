I've rushed release so that people have something to do during the pandemic if they wish.\u00a0 if you notice any mistakes or have any comments feel free to contact me!<br/>**********</p>\n<p>Greetings\r\nnew Trans - Dimensional Gardening Guild Employee! You have taken on a\r\ngreat and important new vocation! Across every dimension and upon\r\nevery world there are special gardens that harbor the most important\r\nelements of life as we know it \u2013 wonder, imagination and magic! And\r\nit is now YOUR job to nurture and maintain these gardens!</p>\n<p>\tThanks\r\nto our wonderful (and proprietary) TDGG technology every quarter you\r\nwill be transported to a wondrous new garden to spend you time in the\r\nregular maintenance and upkeep tasks necessary for its existence and\r\ncontinued flourishing. And should it be necessary you will handle any\r\nemergency tasks that may arise, but if you and your predecessors do\r\nyour jobs properly these events should be rare and more than easy to\r\nhandle.  You will also, from time to time, be required to escort\r\nvarious dignitaries on guided tours and ensure the safety of the\r\ngarden from \u2026 sticky fingers, to put it delicately. Due to the\r\nimportance of your job and the fragility of the garden you will be\r\nunable to leave it, but do not worry; the garden will take care of\r\nyou and supply you with everything you should need to survive your\r\nquarter of caring for it in comfort.</p>\n<p>\tUnfortunately\r\ndue to the fragility of most life forms, and the volatility of trans\r\n- dimensional travel, you will only be able to stay in one dimension\r\nfor one quarter at a time (although you will be able to return after\r\na short absence) so it is VITAL that you read the logs of your\r\npredecessors and leave detailed logs for those who follow in your\r\nfootsteps.</p>\n<p>\tGood\r\nLuck, and Most Importantly, HAVE FUN!<br/></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The\r\nTDGG is  muti-single-player round robin style game, roughly based off\r\nof Takuma Okada's amazing \u201cAlone Among the Stars\u201d Each player\r\nwill start off in their own dimension on their own world in their own\r\ngarden. (Each dimension can have multiple worlds, but each world can\r\nonly have one special garden.) Each player will play through their\r\nquarter within their garden and once they are finished writing their\r\nlog they will trade with another player, who will read the previous\r\nlog entries, then play their own quarter, building upon the previous\r\nlore already created to build an even deeper and more imaginative\r\ngarden. This will continue through several players until everybody\r\nagrees that the Garden's story is complete. Or the game could be\r\nplayed more like a chain letter, where one person starts a garden and\r\nsends it off to another person, who plays a season, then sends it off\r\nto another and etc. until the garden eventually finds its way home to\r\nits originator. This game can even be a single player round robin,\r\nwhere one player creates multiple gardens and plays though them in\r\nsuccession before deciding each one is complete. I'm sure there are\r\nmany other different ways that you can imagine playing this game, as\r\nlong as you and your friends are having fun, I encourage you to\r\nexperiment and have fun!</p>\n<p>\tI\r\nwill be giving you a basic Inspiration Guide (Tables A &amp; B1-3)\r\nhere, but I encourage people the hack to their hearts content, mix up\r\nthe type or number of cards, or the type or number of dice, perhaps\r\ndifferent types of cards for different dimensions, and different\r\ntypes of dice for each world.  The sky is the limit! All I ask is\r\nthat everyone release content for this game as CC:BY-SA so that it is\r\naccessible to everyone who wants to play.  (also If you are planning\r\nto use several Inspiration methods, to make sure that everyone within\r\nyour group has access to the same types of tools for consistency's\r\nsake)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd8e94798c32a83ab869f89d1deae18c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alien_sunset"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
