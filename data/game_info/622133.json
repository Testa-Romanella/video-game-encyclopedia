{"id": 622133, "slug": "asteroids-revisited-v01", "name": "ASTEROIDS REVISITED v0.1", "name_original": "ASTEROIDS REVISITED v0.1", "description": "<p>This is my recreation of the classic 1979 arcade game: Asteroids.\r\n</p>\n<p>And you're looking at the first release!\u00a0It's over to you and I'd really appreciate your feedback. How does it feel to play? Do the controls respond the way you'd expect? Does it look right? Does it sound right?</p>\n<p>I've designed 12 levels. Whereas the original gets harder by adding one more large asteroid per level and making the small flying saucer appear more often, I've taken a more curated approach which should be more nuanced. Let me know if it's too easy, too hard and whether it progresses at the right pace from level to level.</p>\n<p>I plan on addressing issues and fine-tuning the balance ready for the 1.0 release. So don't be shy. I welcome straight-talking feedback as it will help me the most. And if you like it please make a noise on social media! You can find me here or on Twitter @paulmasri.</p>\n\n<p>Asteroids is one of the first games I played in the arcades when I was a teen. I would have been 10 when it first appeared. I know 8-bit pixel art is all the rage, but I love the smooth vector graphics of this game and I've tried to recreate that feel here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've been faithful to the original but not rigidly so. It should look, feel and sound\u00a0like the original, but I've asked questions like \"Why should an asteroid only split in two?\" or \"Why should there only be one flying saucer on the screen at a time?\" \u2014 you'll have to get to the higher levels to start seeing these changes.</p>\n<p>Why have I created\u00a0Asteroids\u00a0Revisited and released it as a free game? This is my first videogame, created in Unity which I learned last year. I have an original game in mind but I kept getting the advice that it's good to start with some mini-projects that have a small scope and see them through from concept to release, and in the end I listened.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faabd34a25e24863de36d0fd71fcb58e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["paul.masristone"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
