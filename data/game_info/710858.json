The goal is to destroy incoming asteroids with your rock cannon, the more you destroy, the higher your score gets, but they will progressively spawn faster. If the planet is hit, it loses its health. Your high score is based off of seconds survived and\u00a0will be saved. The game does have some issues and imperfections but this is what I could create within the time limit. If you find any problems or have any questions about the development of this game, then let me know in the comments!</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Base Player Controller By Sebastian Lague: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ</p>\n<p>Stone Pack: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/stone-pack-f3e0a67b9ca243b09119177649f21e17</p>\n<p>Music By Icoso: https://soundcloud.com/icoso</p>\n<p>Font: Saira Extra Condensed:\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Saira+Extra+Condensed?query=condensed#standard...</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard &amp; Mouse\u00a0Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>.WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>.Mouse Movement - Look</p>\n<p>.Space - Jump</p>\n<p>.T - Light</p>\n<p>.Left Mouse Button\u00a0- Shoot<br/></p>\n<p>.B - Show Tutorial</p>\n\n<p>Ps4 or Ps5 Controller\u00a0Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>.Left Joystick\u00a0- Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>.Right Joystick - Look\r\n</p>\n<p>.X - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>.Triangle - Light</p>\n<p>.Right Trigger - Shoot</p>\n<p>.Square - Show Tutorial</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea3373d3ac58d367ae27dbad1aa9df97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dark_Knife15"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
