Rather than make something destructive, which we had already done, I made this masterpiece of a text game.</p>\n<p>I don't expect anyone to get the references, or even have fun playing it, but I thought that I would just post it to the world for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>To play, press the space key, and from there just press the number for your choice. There are no graphics, and you will die, many, many, many times. Best of luck, and since it is in a .bat format feel free to look in the code and edit it to your hearts desire.</p>\n<p>P.S. Yes, I am currently in the development of an entirely new Text-Based game. It will use the same features as this one, except with a better and longer storyline, and coding that is not a mess to look at.</p>\n<p>Have a Good Day,</p>\n<p>Franchesco Hernando Honduras The III</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e79f7c4abd1b5d3a0069c895f038b74a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Franchesco Hernando Honduras The III"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
