All of these fill up holes, but the chainsaw can chop down trees and the carts can only move in one direction.</li><li>Once a hole if filled up, you can walk and push stuff over it.</li><li>The blue buttons are used to open and close the bridges. The red buttons are used to open and close the fences.</li><li>The cats will attack you if you stand next to them, and the dogs will attack you if you stand in the same row or column as them.</li><li>You can push stuff in the water (USE THIS), but you die when you walk into the water yourself.</li></ul>\n<p>Hopefully the game is accessible enough to be able to complete it without having to read the instructions.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by a game that was included in a Dutch educational game package.
