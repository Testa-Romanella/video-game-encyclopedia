I had one week to create a game in Unity 2D for a final project in my college and decided to make a game in homage to the early internet era where YouTube Poop memes ran wild.</p>\n<p>I hope the game is of some form of hilarity to those of you who play it.</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be much welcomed!<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/></p>\n<p>Some notes/bugs;</p>\n<p>NEW:<br/>V1.4:<br/>* Pause button and attack buttons were conflicting. Corrected this issue in this release.</p>\n<p>Previous Version(s):<br/>V1.3:<br/>* Changed the pause button from a GUI button to a canvas button. Much more efficient.<br/>V1.2:<br/>* Added a pause button while in-game!<br/>*Fixed some bugs due to player feedback.<br/>*Optimized some code behind the scenes to make the game run more efficiently!<br/>V1.1:<br/>*Fixed some visual issues with the credits screen not display all characters.<br/>* When you collect all the treasure, the sound effect from Zelda, the 'Secret' jingle is supposed to play. Sometimes it doesn't, but the door does still open every time after a few seconds.<br/>* Each time you pick up a treasure chest, a random YouTube Poop sound effect is played. Different sounds each time you play!<br/>P.S. The easter egg was all hand-made, coded and created from scratch using just sprite assets. Had to make it as accurate as possible.</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Contact info:</p>\n<p>Tweet me @kirbycarr2<br/>or<br/>Add me on Discord @ kirbycarr2#6275<br/>Thanks for your time reading this far, and have a lovely day! &lt;3 - Joey</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef483fd5182ce10e068aff3d5a6b6d5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joey Carr"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
