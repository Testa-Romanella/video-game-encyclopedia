He's been trying for years, but no matter how many times he reads the mystical scrolls of encabulation, the knowledge just won't stick.</p>\n<p>And the scrolls have had enough.</p>\n<p>In an effort to help him learn (or get rid of him, whichever comes first), the mystical scrolls have transported him\u00a0<em>into</em> the scrolls so he can get some first-hand experience with the material.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The objective of the game is to collect all the runes for a given spell. The player must find their way around the scroll and pick up all the floating purple runes. When they have them all, they progress to the next scroll.</p>\n<p>Standing in Ian's way is mystical knowledge. Deep wisdom (which takes the form of a blue-ish ball) can be pushed around by Ian, but if it falls on top of him, he dies. There are also more lively pieces of wisdom that wander the pages. They also kill Ian, but unlike deep wisdom, they don't need to wait for him to stand underneath them.</p>\n<p>Finally, every scroll is full of Ian's ignorance in the form of a purple mist. This mist is solid to the denizens of the scroll, but Ian removes it as he traverses the scrolls. Learning is a great thing, but too much knowledge can unleash bad things on the world. But more specifically on Ian.</p>\n<p>Use WASD, arrow keys, or a joypad analogue stick to move around.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All coding and artwork, and the concept were\u00a0done by b3agz.
