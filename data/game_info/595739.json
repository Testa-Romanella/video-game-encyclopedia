You as the player need to complete multiple operations throughout the game. As you progress through surgeries, you have to delve deeper and deeper into the person. Can you complete all surgeries without failing ?</p>\n<p>The way this game works is simple. You have tasks in the left hand corner that tell you what to do. You can only complete the tasks in order so just make your way down it. You then need to click the organ that's on the list and then a task menu will open up. Every organs task is different but they are fairly self explanatory. While performing all these tasks ensure to keep watch of the persons blood on the right. If this reaches 0 they die and you lose. When all tasks are completed the surgery is successful and finished.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>This game also features a tutorial for anyone confused :)</li><li>-there is no blood and the graphics well aren't too graphic. They are drawn on my tablet and are cartoony.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREATED BY ONE PERSON</strong></p>\n<ul><li>All of the programming was made by me.</li><li>All of the art was made by me.</li><li>Most of the music was made by me.</li><li>The music background and some sound effects came from epidemic sounds under a licence.</li></ul>\n<p>Created By Zyger : https://www.youtube.com/zygergfx</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c81882602b7c38e97b4e5c4cff5e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ZYGER"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
