{"id": 687214, "slug": "cube-war-invasion", "name": "Cube War Invasion", "name_original": "Cube War Invasion", "description": "<p>The Cuboid invasion has begun. The 2nd Cube War has started and the earth is under assault. Gather your resources and try to defend your HQ against infinite wave of Cuboid nightmares. Be cautious! The\u00a0<em>mothercube</em>\u00a0is an ever-watching presence and will do anything to see you fail.\r\n</p>\n<p>Cube War Invasion has some kinds of history. Thirteen years ago, when I was still in University, I had a course where we had to modify a game where Cubes tried to attack a center point. It was a first-person shooter and we only have to implement some features. My friends and I really went overboard. We added guns and special\u00a0<em>gameplay</em>\u00a0features. It was REALLY fun.\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to live that feeling again so I took a course on\u00a0<em>Udemy</em>\u00a0and decided to learn to develop in Unity. A few weeks later, Cube War Invasion is released. I hope you like the little game and I hope to see you soon on my next project.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions, feel free to post in the comments. I would like to expand upon the game, but at the same time, I'd also really like to try my hand at other prototypes and projects.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T04:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31ca4169e5ad1836c9b9eff4de0d0a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boomwav"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
