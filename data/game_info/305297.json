To this end, and to make things more fun the test takes the form of a stand-alone shark-maiden adventure.</p>\n<p>As an exchange student at Five Thousand Fathoms High School, the inevitable result of your visit is underwater shark-based sex. But which of the three endings will you get? All depends on the choices you made on the way!</p>\n<p>This, like all Shark Dating games, is a rude, crude and immature-humoured visual novel. If that doesn't sound like your bag, feel free to not download this game and I wish you well. If on the other hand you like the sound of it, download away!</p>\n<p>Note that this version is called 'SFW' but that really just means that the saucier bits of the winning pictures at the end are censored. It's still full of swears and crudeness, so make sure grandma isn't watching when you play it. Unless you have a rad grandma.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the uncensored version, that's currently available to $5 a month Patreons over at\u00a0http://patreon.com/sdsxl</p>\n<p>Shark maidens ahoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d6c5e50544b3849700696e7773c6b15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CatfoodMcFly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
