The game has an events system to switch things up on occasion, a couple power-ups, and a high score system. Unlike most of my projects which only have sound effects made in LabChirp, this one actually has theme music, made by Nick West. This was made for 2017\u2019s Becker Arcade Jam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/6666c64b24fdd2ea28f5b4b448b2a8a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blstrManx"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
