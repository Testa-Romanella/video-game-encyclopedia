She decided to work more on a cube game project that one of her friend asked to help him finish. As she was working on it, she blinked once and found herself in the game. She doesn't know if she's in a dream or if it's real. The game she is in consists of several cubical rooms that are trapped. To reach an exit that she assumes there is, she has to avoid the trapped rooms by throwing objects to trigger the traps. Let's see how long you'll survive and find the exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f24/f24608bc412446c9dbdabefa369121a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zeisaka"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
