But it may not be as simple as it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour goal is to draw a shape that will help the orange ball get to the blue ball or vice versa. This is where your imagination comes into play, you must invent such shape that will create a clear path from one ball to the other one. In your calculations, you must include physics - that means friction, gravity, momentum and levers aren't things you should forget. Think, think and invent the best possible shapes to pass all the levels and join the two balls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/492/492792b7ff67169fe82f078a05fd080d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floop Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo", "Floop Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
