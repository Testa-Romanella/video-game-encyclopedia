The developers state that the game is based on the true story.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Your daughter is diagnosed with dementia and is put in the Canton State Insane Asylum. Sometime later, you receive a letter from the asylum staff that she has gone missing from the Asylum. You set out to find her. Upon the protagonist&#39;s arrival, everything goes to hell. Electricity and communication with the outside world get cut off, and supernatural events occur. You have to get out of there.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s controls are usual for the first-person experience. WASD is used for moving, Q and E for leaning, with spacebar to jump and I bound for your inventory. There are no usable weapons present in the game. The only things the players often use are a flashlight, medkits, and some matches. One time in the game the players can use a fire ax to break a door, yet this event is completely scripted. </p>\n<p>The premise of the gameplay is simple: avoid the mysterious Hat Man and the Shadow People that are encountered on your way out of the asylum. The game puts a heavy emphasis on using light sources to see your enemies. It is impossible to attack the enemies, as the players don&#39;t have any weapons at their disposal, so the only thing the players can do is to run away from the creepy creatures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f8/1f87d5420bc3b9cf6368a938750a0565.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.76, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 1043, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Mechanics"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EQ Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
