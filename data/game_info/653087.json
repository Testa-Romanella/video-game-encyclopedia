Your girlfriend ordered a lot in an all-you-can eat sushi restaurant, and then ditched you leaving you on your own. Your goal is to get rid of the extra food\u00a0your stomach can't hold anymore.Unfortunately the game is unfinished\u00a0and still in development, and we will bring it on soon.</p>\n<p>We uploaded a demo so you can test the mechanics we designed.</p>\n<p>Use mouse to drag food from your plates to some customer's one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/32572331c145e8eceb42944d3e4a7989.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alessandro Brizio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
