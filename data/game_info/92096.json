This game is in development and <strong>any feedback</strong> is greatly appreciated!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\r\n\tRevere takes on the classical RPG genre with a twist. It uses a Hybrid Battle system enabling the player to access real time modes as well having the ability to freely adjust and manipulate enemy encounter rates any time they want. The very premise of this game takes place in a hypothetical scenario where our planet has already been destroyed, and then ruled over by supernatural forces.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou play as \r\n\t<strong>Troy</strong>, a traitor to his empire and on a quest for redemption. After finding out what the empire he fought for truly believed in he immediately left during one of his <strong>purging</strong> duties. Finding himself stranded in the middle of the freezing weather he was then helped by one of the locals and then made up his mind to fight for his idea of justice and will ultimately try his very hardest to bring the empire to its knees.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game does have the typical JRPG elements you would normally see in other JRPG's. However we have decided to take a more liberal and interactive approach to the game. Aside from its novel-like aspects we want to make sure that our battle system does have some form of interaction with the player. We believe that simple JRPG's need that sense of interaction which will immerse the player in the world we have tried so hard to create\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAside from dialogue, sophisticated levels and a typical turn based battle system we have decided to add in some interactivity via the game. As in, whatever the player does will influence the overall outcome of the game itself. Although an ambitious and difficult goal we will try and get this through with all our power.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can also refuse to fight common enemies, however this is not recommended as you do need experience to level up and perform better as the game progresses.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe that this 15 hour full game has to be one of total entertainment\r\n\t<strong> and not head on grinding.</strong></p><p>\n<strong>Also notice there is a features list below this segment. </strong>If you are wandering what part of the interaction would the game bring to the player? That is the battle system. We have decided to implement a real time battle system hybrid along with the turn based system. This is solely due to the story and the plot in which the game has.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can find out more below!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThese are the \r\n\t<strong>main characters</strong> that will play major roles within the storyline:\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Troy</strong> plays the traitor and a man seeking nothing else but redemption. After witnessing his dear friend murdered he was left for dead in the winter only to find himself back on track and more than determined to bring the empire on it's knees.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Roland</strong> is a village boy and extremely skilled with the bow. He knows the forests and lands very well and seeks justice for the family he has lost. Although a callous and seemingly cold person he cares deeply for his friends and would gladly help anyone in need.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Anthalia</strong>, or, \"Lia\" is a Lumerian soldier that is in the same predicament as Troy. Seeing the horrors of her empire's doing she fled her homeland and tried to find new meaning in her life. Realizing that she has the opportunity to make the world a better place she wouldn't hesitate to do so even if it would cost her life.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Cecil</strong> was raised in the sandy deserts of Grun and realizes that the world is much more exciting than it seems. She explores the world seeking new thrills and discoveries. Although short tempered and easy to please she is eager to solve problems and would never back down from any fight.\r\n</p><p><strong>Notes: </strong></p><p>1.
