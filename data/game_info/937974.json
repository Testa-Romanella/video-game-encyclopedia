But if you get hit by the roots of the tree 3 times, you'll loose the game and have to start over. It's pretty groundbreaking, we know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's basically a souls-like game but better because it has a beaver in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, use WASD to control the beaver and space to jump.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e9d80a4cc99f13dffe661633d53dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["flow3r_p"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
