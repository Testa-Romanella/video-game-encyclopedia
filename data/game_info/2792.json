It is the only installment in the IP, featuring one DLC which expands the storyline further and one port to the Nintendo Switch, which adds multiple features like accelerated controllers&#39; support and touchscreen assistance.<br />\nThe primary goal of the player is to guide the genius and psychopath painter on the way to complete the painting. The problem is the player does not know how to do so \u2014 they start exploring the house, which is changing the layouts repeatedly and find out many jump-scares along the way.<br />\nGetting through all of the six chapters the player may reach of the three endings: bad, average and good. The end is decided not by momentarily choice but by a series of decisions throughout the game. While the player is uncovering the truth about the premises of the hero&#39;s masterpiece, the DLC tells a story of his daughter which returns to her memories of the past. The DLC also features three endings in the same fashion as the original game.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:19:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6a2/6a2e48933245e2cd3c92248c75c925e1.jpg", "website": "http://layersoffear.com", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 630, "owned": 5557, "beaten": 811, "toplay": 150, "dropped": 217, "playing": 34}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 145, "ratings_count": 1085, "suggestions_count": 556, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1090, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "iOS"], "developers": ["Bloober Team", "Anshar Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aspyr", "Bloober Team"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
