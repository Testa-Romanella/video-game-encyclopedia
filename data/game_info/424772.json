She wakes up in a drunken mess, she wakes up to an outbreak, a Zombie apocalypse... Taylor must save as many people as possible and escape the town.</em></p>\n<p>This project was my first ever 3D game designed early to mid 2019. The play time of the game ranges from 30 minutes to an hour depending you want find all the hidden collectibles\u00a0or just progress the story. The main challenges are the hordes\u00a0of zombies attacking you but there are some other challenges and puzzles as well as finding all the collectibles. I designed the story, the level design and the coding for the game, the art and asset packs were\u00a0<strong>not me.</strong></p>\n<p>This being my first 3D game i learned a lot form the project. The main thing i learned what the importance of prototyping before delving straight into the design. Designing the level on paper first and outlining the main quests and story plots helped massively and saved a lot of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0(Credits is in a Word document inside the Zipped folder)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3eca39d3bdeb6c500b5f7493d742770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFC132"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
