Make sure to keep quiet or it'll hear you.</p>\n<p>This is a short horror game with simple mechanics based around audio. The game will use your microphone so please have one plugged in for maximum effect. But other in-game noises such as footsteps and doors opening &amp; closing are equally something to be aware of when the monster is near.<br/></p>\n<p>There's two versions:</p>\n<p>v1.0 was submitted in the time limit, but has a bug in it that prevents the AI from correctly following you in the second half (a dumb one line of code lol). Also you could immediately win the game by mashing E.<br/></p>\n<p>v1.1 was submitted a bit after the time limit but has the dumb bug fixed. Also you can no longer insta-win :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T08:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d00423fe13c3a7e0bbec60f0a0f1d1be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OfficialPiAddict"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
