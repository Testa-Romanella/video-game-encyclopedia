{"id": 144651, "slug": "owlbeak", "name": "Owlbeak", "name_original": "Owlbeak", "description": "<p>*Must have 2 pc controllers*<br/><br/>Once box opens each player controls a \"Hand\" using left joystick. Pressing and holding A above a character will pick up the character. Release A to drop character. When all players have grabbed a character the level will switch and players are given control of the chosen characters. Tapping the\u00a0A button will shoot a projectile while pressing and holding the A button will activate the characters special abilities.<br/><br/>The bluebirds ability is a \"bomb\" ability which is\u00a0activated when A button is held. Moving the joystick around while the A button is held displays a \"reticle\" and upon releasing the A button the character will throw a bomb landing at that location. Once the bomb has landed it will explode causing all characters near to be knocked back.<br/><br/>The owls ability is a \"dash\" ability. Similar to the bluebirds ability, holding the A button displays a reticle which displays the position to dash to. Upon releasing the A button the owl \"dashes\" to chosen location knocking back any characters in it's way.<br/><br/>Projectiles also cause knock back.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to knock the other player off the platform. (The platform may feel way too large though there would be 4 players and perhaps environmental hazards to fill the space eventually.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/>- There is no \"overview\" screen yet. It's a never ending battle, for you and me.<br/>- There is no GUI. Abilities have a cool down which isn't displayed. It's about 3 seconds between each ability.<br/>- There are probably bugs. I'm sorry, ok?<br/><br/>If you do decide to download and play this please send me a message with any feedback regarding the basic gameplay. Realize that it's placeholder art and all still very much a WIP. Mainly just wanting to know if it's fun, since I can't play it correctly as one person, but any feedback is welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294fdbb21de822159135540b60624411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheOddPotion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
