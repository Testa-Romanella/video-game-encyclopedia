To create this, I\u00a0followed an online tutorial on 2D survival games. I learnt how to\u00a0randomise enemy/item spawn locations, implement a grid based movement system, a turn-based gameplay system, and became familiar with sprite animations. After completing this prototype,\u00a0I successfully created an Android port for it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T11:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f651ad0ba8795a7494c1ecf179ee518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["forevastill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
