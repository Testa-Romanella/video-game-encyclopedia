As a result, the game is very bare-bones and very buggy. I barely scraped together this game within less than 24 hours of development, and I made nearly everything myself (from scratch!). The art is really rushed and unpolished. The gameplay is very floaty and glitchy. The music from Eric Matyas is nice though. (Thank you music artist!)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Note to self: Do not enter a game jam with literally a blank project with no assets at all.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b542e4cc1e2006a89caae31f83c5f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheCakeConsortium"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
