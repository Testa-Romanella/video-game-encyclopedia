{"id": 719, "slug": "deponia", "name": "Deponia", "name_original": "Deponia", "description": "<p>Quest, very close to the original canon of the genre. The game has a minimum of hints, and puzzle solving is often very unobvious.<br />\nThe plot of the game moves forward with the actions of the main character - Rufus, who lives on the planet of Deponia, long ago turned into a dump. Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.<br />\nHe calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation &quot;Organnon&quot;, to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2012-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-06T11:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c2e/c2e6ad5c838d551aeff376f1f3d9d65e.jpg", "website": "http://www.deponia.de", "rating": 3.84, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 255, "owned": 3591, "beaten": 537, "toplay": 95, "dropped": 181, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 95, "ratings_count": 702, "suggestions_count": 600, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 703, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "PC", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
