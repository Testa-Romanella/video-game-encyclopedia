You collect dice that represent weapons, and upgrade the number of dice you can roll at once. Building up your power will let you complete harder and harder quests, and kill bigger and bigger monsters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The RPG itself has lots of different monsters and about a dozen quests to complete. There's secret weapons, spells, and other dice along with a Final Boss to make your knees shake.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>All art and sound\u00a0has been made using Kenney assets and tools. The Creature Mixer was used to design the enemies, and liberal use was taken with the RPG pack. Thanks Kenney!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d3161c3dcbfb09db35f37820c8e39f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["taybenlor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
