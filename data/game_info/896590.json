The goal of this project is to realistically simulate what it's like to be addicted to mobile gacha games while unrealistically simulating what would happen if a bunch of evil robots invaded an abandoned factory.</p>\n<p>-Fight against an onslaught of mechanical warriors with fast-paced combat!</p>\n<p>-Gamble (in-game) money to unlock 6 different characters to fight in a auto-battler! Each has a unique effect that'll assist you while fighting robots!</p>\n<p>-Play with a progressive difficulty system! The more money you spend, the harder the game gets!</p>\n<p>-Fight a big robot at the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Created by students of UW Stout for the Stout Game Expo:</p>\n<p>Zoom Coe - Original Pitch, Player\u00a0and Misc.
