All proceeds will be donated to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund available on GlobalGiving on April 15th. This fund is intended to supply Ukrainian citizens fleeing the invasion with basic essentials such as Food, Clean Water and Shelter. This fund also provides medical care, economic assistance, emotional support and more. <br/></p>\n<p>GlobalGiving Link: https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ukraine-crisis-relief-fund/</p>\n<p>This project will run from March 10th to April 7th, with my donation being posted on social media so everyone can see how much money is raised and verify the donation receipt. I'm waiting until April 15th because of the way Itch.io's financial system is set up. I need to wait a week after purchase to request the money my game earned. I'm giving an additional day to ensure I have all of the funds needed for this donation. I refuse to gain a penny from this fundraiser, all funds will be donated to the Global Giving Relief Fund.<br/></p>\n<p>After April 7th, the game will be marked as free for anyone to enjoy.\u00a0Please support the people of Ukraine during their darkest hour!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T05:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d40/d403fb8e5d8d7840070f4276d20d4224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Camden.Cook65"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
