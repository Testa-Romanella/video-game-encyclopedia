If you pick containers you'll be able to shoot.</p>\n<p>Avoid asteroids and don't get out of the screen! The game screen will collapse little by little.</p>\n<p>This game was done in a day with no much time, hence the bugs. It's obviously based on Alva Majo's Shipped, but applying the limitation of this jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d69884286eeff02b6f339de0e060663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pello"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
