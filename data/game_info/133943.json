The sounds were found on Freesounds.org. The graphic design was made by myself.<br/><br/>The theme of the Game Jam was \"Create a Puzzle Game with a grid system\". I had only few hours for this project, so I had to stay cool and keep that simple :)\u00a0<br/><br/>That's my first participation at a Game Jam so it was a new experience for me... I really like this kind of challenge ! Specially because, ironically,\u00a0I am not really into the puzzle games. So without this Jam I would probably never code this game !<br/><br/>Hope you'll like it !
