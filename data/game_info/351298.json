That hero shouldn't be Martin McNish but life has an odd sense of humour sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is your task to help Martin, become a hero.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLow reflexes are highly recommended to play the game. The interface is the simplest possible. Player can move, pick up items and talk to characters with a single click. Items can be used with a simple drag operation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore than 50 environments and illustrations have been created for the game. We love 3D technology so much that we decided not to include any of it in our game. Everything was created in the good old and painful 2D way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adc5a0cebb38dc9df38bfcc005f98e46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sinking Sheep"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sinking Sheep"], "esrb_rating": null}
