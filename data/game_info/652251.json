But it demonstrates some of the basics I envisioned for this game idea. After the Famicart 2021 Jam ends, I am moving it to Godot engine where I have technical prototypes of screen flipping (TopDown Zelda Style) as well as 2D lighting effects such as shadows and revealing otherwise invisible sprites. I actually have been thinking about this since Curtis uploaded his Famicart design for 2020, so it's definitely something I will continue to work on at my admittedly bad pace.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T01:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8c062b109bafc2d52c5436b1d18713.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChrisLeeWoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
