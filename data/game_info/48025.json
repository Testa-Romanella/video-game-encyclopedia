This remake puts a modern spin on the classic 1990 tactical title.\" <br/>\u2665 www.ign.com \u2665 <br/><br/>\u201cThis game is a mix of Age of Empires and the Oregon Trail, but with a heck of a lot more action.\u201d <br/>\u201c[\u2026] See for yourself how great this iPhone/iPad game is ! \u201d <br/>\u2665 www.1greatapp.com \u2665 <br/><br/>\u201cA revival in the truest sense, Bluecoats keeps the best elements of the original, replaces parts that begged for overhaul, and wraps the altered formula in a much prettier package. If I had to choose one version to show off as an example of the true potential of genre mashups, it would undoubtedly be this one.\u201d <br/>\u201cIf you\u2019re generally a fan of strategy games and have at least a passing interest in action, you\u2019ll find lots to love in Bluecoats\u2019 three-way mashup. The game\u2019s greatest failing is simply that it lets you jump in on normal difficulty \u2014 it\u2019s utterly clear that you need to move up the challenge ladder starting from the very bottom.\u201d <br/>\u2665 www.ifanzine.com \u2665 <br/><br/>\u201cFor small sessions it does a solid job of making you think on your feet. The iOS version makes far more sense to buy than the PC, and iPad owners will probably get the best out of it. The mini games certainly make for an unusually mixed strategy experience, just make sure not to get too good at the shooting and turn the difficulty up!\u201d <br/>\u2665 www.capsulecomputers.com \u2665 <br/><br/>___________________________________________ <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the colorful strategy game The Bluecoats - North vs South, you play the head of one of the armies of the Civil War.
