You must solve the puzzles with the help of your fire and levitation spells in order to make your way through the vast castle to find your dear companion.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Part of Futuregames 2021 fall term game project 1. Enlighten was created during a 2 week period using Unity with a team of programmers, designers and artists. This game taught our group the importance of communication between ourselves. Something we all have reflected on and intend to improve in our next projects. We also saw how important and useful feedback from every player was, and made decisions accordingly. Something that we believe improved our game for the second week. While the ride at times was bumpy, we believe that we have learned a lot by doing so much in a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>Our target audience was 11 - 15 year olds. While we didn\u2019t encounter that many players within that age range, we met a lot of younger kids aged 5-10. We are happy that many of them enjoyed our game that at times could be challenging to them. They were great at showing us where we could make things easier to understand and what parts of the game were most fun to play and why!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd71237a7af69480b4b7619e158638a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
