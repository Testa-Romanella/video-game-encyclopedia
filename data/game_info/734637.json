{"id": 734637, "slug": "megapony", "name": "Megapony", "name_original": "Megapony", "description": "<p>Once upon a time in a magical land called Equestria, a young game designer named Khao Mortadios set out to create a blend of little ponies and classic NES style platforming the likes of which the world hadn&#39;t seen before. And now, a little more than a year later, Megapony is ready to take the stage in earnest.</p>\n<p>No mere ROM hack, Megapony is a fully customized Megaman-inspired platformer built from the ground up using Game Maker 8. Featuring new enemies and revamped stage design from its previous iterations, the game is quite polished and provides a level of challenge fans of the classic series can sink their teeth into while still being (I&#39;m pretty sure) accessible to newer players with less experience from the take-no-prisoners-but-instead-all-of-their-quarters style gaming from the 80s and early 90s. It&#39;s the best of both worlds! Are you mare enough to take up laser shooting horn and bring Twilight and her friends back to the light and stop the wily Doctor Discord? Time to find out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T03:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec0b7d69499a8c6de4474b704bf2a3b2.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwMOOHb1aeA", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
