It is called \"No Hope in Hell\". You are a devil. You can kill other denizens of hell, and some you can become. You have one goal - escape hell. You have no hope in hell.</p><p>It is our first ludum dare game. In fact, it is our first game. It is much shorter then intended. We had an awesome time making it. These two facts are probably not unrelated. And if you are the kind of person who enjoys hastily put together hell-themed metroidvanias, then please enjoy our sweet, glorious mess. The music is by SB. I am aware hell is probably less pink/mauve. Comments! And thanks for playing!</p><p>Our Ludum dare page is here: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=p...</p><p>Our twitter is @dispcin</p><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e85f06eee1f486065f7a08a79c21df97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["team_disposable"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
