It is a platform game in the style of Manic Miner. The game&#39;s full title according to the cover is More Adventures of Big Mac the Mad Maintenance Man although the game&#39;s opening screen uses the shorter title. Most fans, however, simply remember the game as &#39;Big Mac&#39;.<br />\nThe player takes on the role of the title character who must negotiate a power station consisting of 18 separate levels (vaults). On each level the aim is to avoid a range of defences and press switches to shut down the vault.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T19:34:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c2d/c2d632daa29c7e2d84e103880c948d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Mr. Chip Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Mastertronic"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
