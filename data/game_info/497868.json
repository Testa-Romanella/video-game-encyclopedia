The goal: Make it to the surface. Blast your way through the automatons that have kept the citizens of the underground city, Duc Pointe, trapped below the surface.\u00a0<br/><br/>Steampunk Abyss is at its heart a game about designing crazy weapons, modding them each run using our Byte system\u00a0to take them to the next level. Its about designing\u00a0 abilities - from support abilities to protect you from bullets\u00a0to the more bombastic attack abilities that vaporizes enemies. The core gameplay loop consist of:</p>\n<ul><li>Mix bytes to get new Elements, Abilities, Shapes, or just higher stats</li><li>Set up your build of guns and abilities</li><li>Blast your way through the levels</li><li>Loot</li></ul>\n<p>Each run the Labyrinth shifts. New Bytes and enemies appear as you get further into the dungeon. Each run adds to your power and allows you to come closer to the surface. Scrap enemies remains to receive some gears to spend on upgrades and maybe find a new interesting Byte.<br/></p>\n<p>At this point we mostly only have the Integer Bytes for your guns complete. Our element mixing system is also functional, but currently does not effect play. It is also missing some elements that are coming soon.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>_____________________</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>General Controls</strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD - Move</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse - Sprint</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse - Shoot</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q - Interact/Destroy junk\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tips: Robots junk can be destroyed with Q to drop loot and prevent repair.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>E - Switch gun side</strong></p>\n<p><strong>M - Open Map</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>_____________________</strong></strong><br/></p>\n<p>We are currently targeting PC and Xbox One.

However I was finally able to quit my job and focus on building a prototype and put together a team. We are now working full time to get this project off the ground. I am excited to be putting this project out there.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Jordan Shelton - Lead programmer and designer. I have 12 years of programming experience and 10 of that is in Games. I have also dabbled in Gamemaker, Godot, Unity and Unreal at various times in the past. I love games, especially as a tool for story telling.\u00a0</p>\r\nJordan Shelton\r\n<p>I'm Thomas, aka Bahototh - \u00a0I'm an indie artist/designer from Finland. I have been pushing the pixels for quite a few years, all the way from the C64 and Amiga days. I do the majority of the graphics for Steampunk Abyss and loving the really creative and fun teamwork.

By night, I compose music and play the tuba in a local band. When I'm not doing any of those things, you'll likely find me playing a mix of video games and board games, baking the odd cake or getting lost in a good book. I have been composing music for myself and various unpublished projects for 8 years and I have a B.A. in Music. The main program I use is Logic and I'm also in the process of learning how to use Little Sound DJ. I am the team's music composer. \u00a0If you'd like to hear more of my work, check out my youtube channel or my sound cloud page:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcr89GT0r6tVkG7BYm1P9A\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/www-surfing-dinosaur-554024736/tracks</p>\r\nKyle Rausch", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/5853c4ce2919afcb75797de054bb0231.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VideoGamester"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
