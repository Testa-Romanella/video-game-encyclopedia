Please enjoy playing around with Maggie's unique skills!</p>\n<p>Use your magnetic abilities to push and pull your way through a variety of levels! If you're running out of steam, pick up some sparks and recharge your health!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Play Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Move</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>Left Stick / D-Pad<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Arrow Keys / WASD\r\nRun left and right.\u00a0Self-explanatory, really.\r\n<strong>Jump</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>A<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Z / Space\r\nJump up in the air. Hold it to jump higher.\r\nIf you're magnetised to a wall, you can jump off of it too!\r\n<strong>Polarity</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>X<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>X\r\nSwitches between the very scientific red and blue polarities.\r\nRed is attracted to blue, and repelled by red.\r\nBlue is attracted to red, and repelled by blue.\r\n<strong>Rotate</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>L / R / LT / RT<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Q / Left Shift / C / E\r\nRotates Maggie's body clockwise and counter-clockwise. You can only be magnetised to an object if you're facing it!\r\n<strong>Pause</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>Start<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Escape\r\nStops you from playing.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Build Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Move Cursor</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>Left Stick / D-Pad<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Mouse\r\nMoves the build cursor around. If you move it close to the edge of the screen, the camera will follow after it.\r\n<strong>Scroll Camera</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>Right Stick<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Arrow Keys /\u00a0WASD\r\nMoves the camera on its own without moving the build cursor.\u00a0Can be useful to quickly get to a part of the level.\r\n<strong>Build</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>A<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Left Click\r\nPlaces your selected block/object right on top of the cursor. Keep holding to place more!\r\n<strong>Delete</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>B<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Right Click\r\nDeletes whatever the cursor is pointed at.\u00a0Also closes the Modify Menu.\r\n<strong>Modify</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>X<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Left Shift /\u00a0Middle Click\r\nImplements simple tweaks (e.g. spike direction) on the object the cursor's pointing at.\r\nFor more complicated objects (e.g. blocks, gates, magnets) it opens the Modify Menu, allowing you to tweak various elements.\r\n<strong>Switch Selection</strong>\n<em>Gamepad<br/></em>LT / RT<br/><em>Keyboard<br/></em>Just, like, click on them\r\nChanges the object you have selected for placement.\r\nYou can also choose menu options like playtesting or getting back to the title. If they don't work at first, try \"placing\" them.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Credits &amp; Junk</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The main theme was composed by\u00a0Sam Shandley! I highly recommend checking out his work.\r\n</p>\n<p>Otherwise the game was made by me I guess?\r\n</p>\n<p>Personally I recommend using a gamepad for playing and keyboard for building.<br/></p>\n<p>And be sure to only play levels from people you trust! I don't\u00a0<em>think\u00a0</em>a raw text dump could do anything too harmful, mind you, but it's always better to be careful.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T19:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/fae87565fdeeb6a6e3a2b25a79dc932c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Deuce"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
