Do nothing about them and you\u2019ll have to fend off zombified veggies. Swing your trusty farm tools to defend yourself and your remaining crops. Remember just because it's the apocalypse doesn't mean bills aren\u2019t due. Fall behind and you\u2019ll be evicted so make sure to be selling those delicious root vegetables by leaving them in the crate by the entrance to the farm and top up on seeds from your shed! Welcome to RootZ.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Please make sure to read the controls before playing. You can only play one round and must plant the seeds before using the start bell for the zombies to spawn. Unfortunately to due time constraints many of our ideas and assets went unused however you can find most of them through our repository link.</em></p>\n\n<p>This game was submitted for the Gateshead College internal game jam and won out of 29 submissions!
