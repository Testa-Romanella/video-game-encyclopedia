I am a professional software engineer that never forgot why I became a software engineer in the first place - I wanted to make great games. Eclectically inspired by games as varied as Diablo 2, XCom, Super Mario, Final Fantasy, Battle Brothers, World of Warcraft, Dwarf Fortress and Baldur's Gate 2, I am passionate about making games that I want to play myself.<br/><br/>I didn't make this game alone, however. I couldn't have made this game without the brilliant (and ongoing) support from Benvictus and Nyknck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T02:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f552585dee60ffc93d3631798c9446c.jpg", "website": "https://everpixel-tactics.manakeep.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doom Dino Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Doom Dino Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
