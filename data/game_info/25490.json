Players take on the role of \n      baby Upa, a prince of the Akuyo kingdom. Prince Upa must take on an \n      adventure spanning seven different worlds in order to rescue the kingdom \n      from the dangerous demon Zai. Upa must defeat the enemies he meets along \n      the way by inflating them. Upa can then use these floating enemies to \n      his advantage by bouncing off of or riding on top of them. The prince \n      must also avoid deadly thorns and pits while keeping an eye out for \n      helpful items such as milk (to restore health) and bells (for temporary \n      invincibility) if he hopes to succeed. If you\u2019re looking for a cute and \n      solid platformer with a hero unlike those in most other games, then look \n      no further than BIO MIRACLE BOKUTTE UPA.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
