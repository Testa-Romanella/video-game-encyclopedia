It's great if you're tired of the preciseness and accuracy of button clicking and instead you want your main form of defense to be about as good as a drunken lazer tag employee.\u00a0In the end though, the goal is the same as any arcade game, beat your high score!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Developement</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was slapped together with Harper Rhett on programming and models, and\u00a0Giuliano De Pian on\u00a0music and sound effects.
