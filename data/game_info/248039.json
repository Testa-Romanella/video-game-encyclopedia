Items you get from getting pumpkins are keys for certain\u00a0people of things in the game to further your pumpkin collection, so look around and decide if the item you got previously could be used for whatever you find. If it is, you'll get an item and pumpkin, if not, try a different thing.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There is a .txt file in the folder titled: Order of Events.txt. This gives a <strong>subtle</strong>\u00a0order of things you're meant to do since the game doesn't tell you yet.</p><p>EDIT: The game is currently unbeatable due to an unexpected bug, will be fixed soon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e989224c15db04f3fce167ed24f1671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jarrodmclagit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
