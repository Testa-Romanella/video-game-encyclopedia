Last levels contain a follow camera.\r\nI have added a \"cheat mode\" where you press \"C\" and turn off the colliders and when you press \"L\" for next level, for debugging and testing. Then I've decided not to remove them.\r\nI haven't added any menu yet, so you can use ALT + F4 to close the game.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!GitHub page for this game https://github.com/Scientist8/Rocket_Boost_3D.game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:34:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b58d0a651dd6ad2ea222ffb55293bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scientist859"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
