The idea was to design an environment for player to navigate in and implement light environmental story elements. Also more complex mechanics used such as locked chests and keycodes to add complexity to the gameplay.\u00a0</p><p>The goal was to create a more complex area than I have done before. Also I wanted to implement a bit more complex key and code finding to make the exploration more layered.</p>\n<p>The story of the level is that a sentient plant has taken over the station and the player must navigate their way through the station to find something to defend themselves with.</p>\n<p>Made in Unity using Probuilder and free prototype 3d assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/550ab65307bdc616b067b98417c044f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timi_Pahlsten"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
