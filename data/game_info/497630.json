I didn;t have a lot of time to work on it due to college, so I couldn't get a save feature working. All art, sounds, and music were made by me. This was my firs game jam and it was a lot of fun so thank you to the people at Firith Studio for hosting this jam! Sorry for Mac people I could only afford the Windows export for GMS2.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>Z : Rake</p>\n<p>X: Open shop (only usable when at the shop)</p>\n<p>Mouse: Make selections</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I developed this game using Game Maker Studio 2. I own a license for GMS1 and didn't know if upgrading would be worth it so I got a trial license for GMS2 not realizing that you can't export an exe using it. I was gonna buy the license for it anyway but not until after the semester because I am not working right now, and I'm trying to conserve my money.\u00a0 However by the time I found this out I didn't have time to port it to GMS1 so I had to buy the 12 month license which cost me like half of my bank account.
