It's honestly really janky, but it's full of charm and laughs. The hitboxes can be really unfair, but the jank is really what makes the game great, as well as the amazing sound effects and soundtrack (sarcasm)</p>\n<p>In all honesty, I hope you enjoy it! Just keep it in perspective that this was made by a 13 year old :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e8/1e8ae169a72e419dd26ace0800819a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maninthebox69"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
