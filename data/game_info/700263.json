In order to end this everlasting battle, our frail hero will have to die a lot.</p>\n<p> Why? Well, each time the player gets killed he will be allowed to choose an upgrade to help him during the boss fight. These upgrades can range from UI changes to player buffs, making each upgrade choice difficult.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Afonso Santos - Ui Programmer</p>\n<p>Bernardo \"Tostas\" Santos - Artist</p>\n<p>Gean Silva - Artist</p>\n<p>Marcos Engelhard - Gameplay and AI Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Jos\u00e9 Santos - Sound Designer<br/><br/>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Arrows</p>\n<p>Left button - Click Upgrade, Attack</p>\n<p>Right Click - Dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:28:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9e952317067cd63d2fc05dfb5039fed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcos Engelhard", "Gean Carlos", "Zironix00"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
