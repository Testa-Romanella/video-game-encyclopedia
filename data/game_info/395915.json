{"id": 395915, "slug": "blake-and-whitley-adventure-mode", "name": "Blake and Whitley - adventure mode", "name_original": "Blake and Whitley - adventure mode", "description": "<p>This is a game jam game that's been a bit more fleshed out. One player plays with Blake (the ninja), the other with Whitley (the sir). Each character needs to stay on their color of platform, or fall into the abyss and lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every so often a new platform appears and the oldest of both colors dissappears. These will turn gray before doing so. BONUS: gray platforms can be stood on by both characters.</p>\n<p>Adventure mode includes some power ups: jumping higher or lower, speeding up, extra jumps or even switching directional controls (this one can be excluded by starting the game with space bar instead of enter). Collect powerups, cycle through them by pressing down, and activate them with space bar. That's right, space bar activates the power ups that are first for BOTH parties.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15b/15b65ac4aae03a12a3fbe162c880ea27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saffron Streams // Comedy Reflux"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
