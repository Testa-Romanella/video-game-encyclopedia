Whole project started when I was experimenting with environment design and it has slowly transformed into this short metaphorcial journey which I decided to share with you. Working on this project was a very interesting and rewarding experience that has taught me a lot and pushed my limits. <br/><br/><br/>I understand that this game is quite unusual and it may not fit everyone's style but hopefuly there are some of you who will enjoy this journey and find themselves in it.<br/><br/>Enjoy! <br/>- Ondrej", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c88598797ad7be0c6644c7de9bbac7a.jpg", "website": "https://ondrejangelovic.wordpress.com/", "rating": 2.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 182, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Simple Ghost"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Simple Ghost"], "esrb_rating": null}
