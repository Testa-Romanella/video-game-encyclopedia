{"id": 549299, "slug": "bootleggers", "name": "Bootleggers", "name_original": "Bootleggers", "description": "<p>Welcome to Bootleggers, a game about running booze and engaging in criminal activities ostensibly in 1920s New York. Inspired by works such as <em>The\u00a0Great Gatsby</em>, this game for 3-6 players, including a GM, this game seeks to emulate the pursuit of unobtainable goals, the green light of the Gatsby novel. A simple system, involving a few skills and a six-sided die, Bootleggers seeks to encourage characters to chase their dreams but also to choose between those dreams and helping those around you.\u00a0</p><p>The 11ish page PDF should be an easy read, and the system itself is good for short sessions or one-shots, with simple character creation and rules. All feedback, assuming it is in good faith, is much appreciated. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf77fae98b33949aab0969f62e1090b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retorox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
