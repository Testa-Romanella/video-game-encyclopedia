To forge a clear path, you'll need to destroy some blocks to light the way - or use the flashlight to see ahead, and burn through your limited time even faster. If blocks are falling down towards you, navigate around them - destroy them from the side, or destroy them from above.</p>\n<p>The player can choose how the blocks function - with Sticky rules, blocks of the same colour will clump together, making them easier to navigate around. With Non-Sticky rules, blocks will fall down until they hit an obstacle regardless of colour, making them that much harder to work around. Use your side-drilling tool, and don't forget you can always drill downwards to light up blocks around you.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS (Keyboard only):</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - player movement, destroy blocks on contact<br/></p>\n<p>Spacebar+Arrow keys - destroy blocks adjacent to the player<br/></p>\n<p>W key - flashlight on/off (drains more time)</p>\n<p>Escape key - pause the game</p>\n\n<p>NOTE :</p>\n<p>Created for the \"My First Game Jam Summer 2018\" expo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f46a90c7c6bcf458b9cc1c8d2d6eb396.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1988stevenm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
