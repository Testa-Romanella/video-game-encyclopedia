Forced to stay in the dark, you have to rely mostly on your hearing in order to succeed.</p><p>The goal of the game is to find and collect three numbers hidden in the labyrinth. You can only know where they are if you pay close attention to where their sound is coming from.</p><p>While you search you must aviod the three enemies. If they see you, they will turn off their lights and try to hunt you down in the darkness. But if they lose your trail, they will turn back on their lights and continue searching.</p>Controls<p>\r\n\tUse the left analog stick of your controller to move. <br/>\r\n\tPress \"start\" to pause the game.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you don't have a Controller, use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Press \"spacebar\" to pause the game.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAbskur is played best with a Xbox 360 Controller, because the rumble provides additional feedback and adds to the experience.<br/>\n</p>Credits<p>\r\n\tJonas Tyroller (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)<br/>\r\n\tShahriar Shahrabi (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)<br/>\r\n\tLenja Kaufmann (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game was created in the course of the second semester of the Game Design Bachelor program of the HTW-Berlin.\r\n</p><p>Special thanks to our professors and coaches:<br/>Prof. Susanne Brandhorst<br/>Prof. Thomas Bremer<br/>Sven-Thomas Gorholt</p><p><strong>Abskur has been awarded at the German Multimedia Prize in 2016!</strong><br/>\r\n\t(\"Deutscher Multimediapreis mb21\")\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor more Information, visit their website :<br/>\r\n\thttp://www.mb21.de/wettbewerbsjahr_2016.html?artic...\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e2107a58cfac0591b33aad1064729560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LenjaK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
