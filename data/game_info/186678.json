It\u2019s mainly a learning project, serving the purpose of teaching basic game devlopment skills while creating a complete game by using smaller projects that could be made on a short time constrain.</p>\n<p>The game is based on \u2018WarioWare\u2019-like games; a collection of 5-second microgames in sequence with just a few instructions on what to do. This design was helpful to teach basic Godot concepts and game-development mechanics, while contributing to a bigger project.</p>\n<p>The project was created using Godot, an Open-Source (MIT) game engine; the project itself is also Open-Source, hopefully encouraging more projects for the FOSS games ecossystem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a66394ed868df69e60d8c00cfc5d643.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gamux"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
