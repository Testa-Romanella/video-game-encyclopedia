To do so, you can make or melt ice blocks and let them fall or slide them towards enemies.</p>\n<p>Controls: W A S D to walk through a level, SPACE to place/destroy Blocks and<br/>ARROW KEYS/WASD to move in menu, ENTER to press selected button<br/>and ESCAPE ingame to pause.</p>\n\n<p>If it's valid to place ice the current selection is green, otherwise, it's red. The behavior of the ice is very important for the game. Take a closer look at the different appearance of the ice when its placed on walls, it freezes there. So sometimes it takes a little bit of brainwork how you eliminate that flame.</p>\n<p>At the moment I'm working on the SaveGame, it's not available yet, but for now, I added a SKIP and RETRY button on the pause menu (ESC).</p>\n<p>Eskimo Revenge is the first game I made for my university on my own with MonoGame. The gameplay is inspired by Solomons key 2, an NES game.</p>\n<p>Updates will follow bc I know there are some issues left and I want to make more levels! I also already added a Level Editor I programmed myself, but this one needs more developing time. ( You can see it by pressing E in the menu, but if u save what you draw the game maybe crashes and a level is overwritten)</p>\n<p>\u00a0I\u00a0hope u enjoy this game anyways!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120c4094cda63dec5b8986585b6d90b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TmrMoss"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
