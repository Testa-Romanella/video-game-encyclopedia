Things sure get scary real fast!\r\n<p>By rapidly and efficiently destroying enemies, your <strong>SPOOK LEVEL </strong>will start to slowly increase<strong>, </strong>affecting the aggressiveness of Flandre's attacks and the enemies'.

At the heart of Spooktastic Mansion Adventure's scoring are two elements: the <strong>Chain System </strong>and the <strong>Laevateinn Laser.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Defeating enemies gives you purple crystals - which increase your\u00a0<strong>Chain Meter up</strong> to a maximum of <strong>64x - </strong>and blue point items which give some score. When your <strong>Chain Meter </strong>is high enough, it's time to activate Flandre's ultimate weapon: the deadly <strong>Laevateinn Laser </strong>which clears chaos just as perfectly as how Sakuya does her housework!</p>\n<p>While using your laser, enemies will drop <strong>golden point items, </strong>which give you massive scores <em>equivalent to your Chain Meter.</em> After the laser runs dry, your chain resets and you can do it all over again.</p>\n\r\nThis is what the shmup enthusiasts call \"good visual feedback\".\r\n\r\n<p>High scores are essential to obtaining bonus lives, and more special enemies which drop laser-refilling items will appear the faster you progress through the stage. </p>\n<p><strong>Shoot, dodge, and Laevateinn - that's the nature of this high-speed trick-or-treating shmup!</strong></p>\r\nGIMME A SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT\r\n<ul><li>2\u00a0minutes\u00a0of\u00a0exciting\u00a0shoot-em-up\u00a0gameplay,\u00a0featuring\u00a0a\u00a0difficult\u00a0boss\u00a0and\u00a0countless hordes of\u00a0enemies.</li><li>A simple, yet engaging <strong>Chain System </strong>focused on unleashing powerful bursts of power and cashing in big scores.</li><li>Charming pixel art style.</li><li>A lightheartedly spooky atmosphere - <strong>no jumpscares (promise)!<br/></strong></li><li>A fantastic 2-song soundtrack to jam to while playing.</li><li>Quality-of-life features such as toggleable extra lives, background opacity, effect cuts, and more.</li></ul>\r\n...SO LIKE, WHO'S BEHIND THIS THINGAMAJIG?\r\n<p><strong>PROGRAMMER, GAME DESIGNER &amp; ARTIST</strong></p>\n<p>Kevin Minh (Kevinmonitor)</p>\n<p><strong>PIXEL ARTIST</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pachy<br/></p>\n<p><strong>COMPOSER</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Armand Payan</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL SOUND EFFECTS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Freesound.org (RaspberryTickle, Matias Michael Lahoud, Zagames)<br/>Ryannlib Asset Library (a library of Touhou-style sound effects for noncommercial use)<br/>bfxr (free SFX maker)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51fbb989e9238860bef65d28c0283cdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Mink"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
