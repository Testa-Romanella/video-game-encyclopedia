(Anniversary Edition lol)", "description": "<p>I made this game a very long time ago. From the maker of BALLOUT! Big D (then known as lil d) made this game. It's slightly cooler than BALLOUT and more fun to play!</p><p>It's been off the Play store since 2018, but now RAINDROPS! is back exclusively on itch.io!!! And it somehow kinda still works on modern smartphones (with some emphasis on the kinda).<br/></p>\n<p>The game is about avoiding raindrops, collecting sick powerups and racking up massive scores. You play by tilting your device (just like in the old days).</p>\n<p>Note that if you stay on the side of the screen you will be swarmed and die. This is not a bug and was an actual intentional piece of game design. Lil d just didn't feel like mentioning it in the tutorial, and later heard many friends in middle school complain about it.<br/></p>\n<p>Note that the hitboxes are kinda off if you play this game on a modern device, which makes the game hard to play. This is because of the high-resolution screens on modern devices. The game targeted a resolution of 240x320 I think lol. For the best possible experience this game should be played on a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro in 2013.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has even sicker dynamic ray traced lighting than BALLOUT! It also has music that I made before I learned how to actually make music. So that' s pretty sick. Also look at those menu animations! That kinda looks like something I would make today. WTF?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!</p>\n<p>Like BALLOUT! the leaderboards do not work, however the highscore thing works and it looks effin sick! Just click the Highscore thing in the main menu and prepare to have your mind blown! It's so smooth. Especially when you're not using a phone from 2010.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b8829b532d2cf95cb408086c1b3a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DennisMagnusson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
