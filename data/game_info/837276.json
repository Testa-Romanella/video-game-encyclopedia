The strategies you employ, the moves that you counter and the flexibility with which you spindle checkmates is determined by the souls and artifacts that you can summon.\r\n</p>\n<p>These come in the form of three types of cards: Heroes, Weapons &amp; Glyphs, some belonging to a specific god\u2019s cult.\r\n</p>\n<p>In total, 98 base cards await to fill your first Retinue. For the purpose of this demo, all of them are unlocked and can be encountered randomly in Draft Mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>TURN-BASED TACTICS, NO RNG\r\n</p>\n<p>With The Gods Are Fickle, we set out to marry the mechanical tightness and lack of RNG of the most succesful tactics game of all time - chess - with the inovations and fun brought by great modern turn-based games such as <em>Banner Saga, Battle Brothers, Duelyst, Trials of Fire, Hearthstone </em>or<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> and all the other greats.\r\n</p>\n<p>The success of player's decisions do not depend at all on randomness once the battle starts.\u00a0In TGAF there are no dice rolls and no variability in damage.</p>\n<p>DRAFT MODE (MULTIPLAYER PVP)\r\n</p>\n<p>You will be able to play Draft mode (PvP, inspired by Hearthstone\u2019s Arena and other CCGs/deckbuilders), where  you will be faced with 11 choices, each presenting 3 random cards from which only 1 can be picked.\r\n</p>\n<p>You will assemble a team of 3 pieces out of the cards picked and fight another player.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you have a hard time finding an opponent, consider joining our Discord, where other players reside (and new content is tested early).\r\n</p>\n<p>Once we have AI opponents, a match should always be available.\r\n</p>\n<p>THANK YOU!\r\n</p>\n<p>We will need lots of help in making this the best game we can. It\u2019s a big project with many moving parts, and it\u2019s hard to figure everything out on your own, plus! indie gamedev is better fun with friends!\r\n</p>\n<p>So, if you wish to be a part of this journey, you can join our Discord server: https://discord.gg/67t5W5zFsY</p>\n<em>If you're interested to read what this pre-alpha test is building towards, you can read the Game Vision document here:\u00a0</em>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1To9QkqojZzZM1A27WaaEdEA_WvraKjY0ep65KMpBexA/edit?usp=sharing", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T13:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/553c30a8a11ae011b1f8c74af97d9bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Critique Gaming"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
