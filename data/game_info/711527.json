The stress of getting presents in order to not hurt someones feelings.....but you know who is over it? Santa himself! Yes! On Christmas night he decided to not bring anyone presents and instead got so drunk, he now mocks people not getting anything for Christmas! What an asshole! When you finally see him he still runs away, bombarding you with ominous christmas presents and bottles of alcohol! Try to take this to your advantage! See you dont get hurt by the red presents, if so, just you collect the green ones for health. If you want to avoid it altogether, collect the blue ones for the shield. And the gold ones! Oh, the gold ones! Collect enough of those and you get the means of fighting back against this crazed Santa. It is a governemt approved rocket launcher of course!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So get on track and get your presents back! What are you waiting for?</p><p>Contributors:</p><p>Adelina Khutieva - Resources</p><p>Fahad Sulaiman - Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Mia Mohac - Programmer</p><p>Philipp\u00a0Labner - 3D Stuff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10c/10ca51f86d315da0d4cca7b63cbcadd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philipp Labner"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
