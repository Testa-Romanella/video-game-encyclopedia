{"id": 385134, "slug": "astro-hammer", "name": "Astro Hammer", "name_original": "Astro Hammer", "description": "<p>Astro Hammer is a simple old-school shooter in the style of 80s classics such as Astro Blaster, Galaxians and Space Invaders. Obliterate increasing waves of enemies as they descend from the top of the screen and prevent them landing on Earth. The game features simple but colorful graphics, some cool power-ups and some challenging gameplay elements. It is a score-attack game designed for quick sessions, maybe waiting for take-out, a bus, or just having a morning coffee. I hope everyone enjoys it.</p>\n<p>The game was targeted for mobile but also plays well on desktop Macs and PCs. It is window mode only and is mouse controlled. Press \"P\" to Pause the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:32:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c9349d33da53bbd739c77e5bdf4b41d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jewelthrone"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
