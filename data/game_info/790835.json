I figured the hell part would be the thing that fits the Underground theme.</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Jump with Space, the longer you hold it, the further you jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- When a goon spawns, left click on it to damage it while it's floating around, there are 3 variations of goons in total.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- The little portals that occasionally spawn will transport you to the opposite parallel world, among touching it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- You can break through blocks at the expense of losing half a life, but you also get about a second of immunity, be wise with that. One block that spawns in hell, you can also break, but it will instantly kill you.</p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/></p><p>\u00a0- Art: me</p><p>\u00a0- Sound effects: me</p><p>\u00a0- Font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/arcade-classic-2.font</p><p>\u00a0- Music:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/retro-platforming/45...</p><p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/download/boss-time/2340</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T12:59:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bcea91507d3f3eb9d597a66891b3918a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["local_sewage_system"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
