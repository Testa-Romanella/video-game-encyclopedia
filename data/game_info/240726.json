It's a local history told by adults to frighten children who use to disobey their parents, so they get scary to get away from the parents and avoid to get lost and harmed.</p>\n<p>The game was developed with Unty 5, Corel Draw, Photoshop and After Effects.</p>\r\nTEAM:<p>Abilio Nogueira - Programming<br/>Everton Gonsaga - Programming<br/>Otacilio Saraiva - Programming<br/>Marcelino Borges - 2D artist and Programming\u00a0<br/>Renata Melo - 2D artist<br/>Emmanuel Peixoto - Music and FX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/24492c665cd653cf9f17ab770c38811d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcelinoB0rges"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
