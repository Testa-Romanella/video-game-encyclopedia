{"id": 824317, "slug": "ape-adventure-jemoores", "name": "Ape Adventure (JEMoores)", "name_original": "Ape Adventure (JEMoores)", "description": "<p>Ape Adventure is an action game for those who enjoy smashing everything as you explore. The more you explore, the more surprises you will uncover. Pterodactyls and biplanes are flying enemies. Defend yourself by kicking skulls up at them. Jumping gives your fist fight power to defeat enemies too.</p>\n<p>Find and rescue your favorite girl. Collect fruit and trade it for upgrades so you can play as other apes. Collect enough fruit to unlock a Sasquatch, or Yeti. Defeat 50 enemies and receive a 250 fruit bonus! Ride the Dinos and they will destroy enemies on contact. Even their Dino skeleton will destroy enemies. The Dinos will protect you with their life, but they can also run you over when they get scared and stampede! For me, riding Dinos is one of the most hilarious and chaotic parts of this game.</p>\n<p>Ape Adventure Levels:</p>\n<p>Tutorial: Learn how to play Ape Adventure with these basic Ape Lessons and you will be a smart ape.</p>\n<p>1931 Island: Defeat 50 enemies for 250 bonus fruit. Look for the Golden Statue to enter 1972 level.</p>\n<p>1972 City: Return the Golden Statue to the Temple for 50 bonus fruit. Defeat 50 enemies for 250 bonus fruit. Look for the Space Ship to enter 2012 level.</p>\n<p>2012 Space: Battle and defeat 100 monoliths for 250 bonus fruit.</p>\n<p>Captured: Your ape is in chains and you must break free, rescue the girl, and escape.</p>\n<p>To play Ape Adventure on Windows PC use the left, right, and up arrow keys on your keyboard. The ape will blast out a powerful beam of energy every time you jump. Use the blast to fight enemies. If your ape ever gets stuck or trampled by Dinos, tap the fruit score in the top left corner to return to the main menu.</p>\n<p>Ape Adventure has a lot of physics objects that act as obstacles and barriers. Things like buildings, wooden logs, leaves, and Dinos can either help you or hinder you as you try to survive each level. How you use objects to your benefit in order to avoid any problem they may cause is all part of the gameplay. Something that was just helping you, could suddenly trap you, or get you in trouble. It\u2019s not easy being an ape.</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you play this game using a USB game controller, the jump and fight functions will become separate buttons, which is awesome. You will also notice that the ape character will not turn back and forth when using a controller, which is not awesome. This game plays best when using only the left, right, and up arrow keys on the keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T13:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/433b96c01f16e40140e5cb38c6711abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JEMoores"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
