However the task will not be easy since reapers possessed the bodies of some of them who will have the task of eliminating all the survivors and delaying them. It is still possible to perform a group exorcism that is fatal for anyone but with luck we can eliminate ghosts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9da65b7d13a2a6a781dfb59a72297e6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamezeraStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
