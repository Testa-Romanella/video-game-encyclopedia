It's still cute proof of concept we may end up regrouping and returning too at a future time where we already have numerous other characters, stories, and mechanics planned!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Team:<br/>@LotusPrynce -Programming</p>\n<p>@Eldritchia - Art<br/></p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/bakabrook\u00a0- Music!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/502b5523d04df85d6eb83ab6734373d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SakuraCrowned"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
