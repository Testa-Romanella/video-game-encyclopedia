The game can be played as is but there might be some (unkown) bugs. The game will be updated\u00a0regularly!\u00a0If you notice a bug, please make a comment so that the bug can be fixed.</p><p>Any other feedback is appreciated as well :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>IceStruggle can be played alone or together with a friend. If you are playing alone, you can use the\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong> keys to move and to use an action press\u00a0<strong>P</strong>. The second player uses the\u00a0<strong>ARROW</strong> keys to move. Action differ when playing together!</p>\n<p><strong><em>[Controller Input currently disabled]</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Because there is not much space on one keyboard to play together, you can control your character by connecting your Nintendo Switch Joycon(s) to your PC (Bluetooth). Hold your Joycon horizontally. Other controllers will be added in future updates!</p>\n<p>Have fun and tell me how the game can be improved :)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs that will be addressed soon</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Map tiles glitch when there are too many holes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T05:10:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c13b17d913c08f97e3aaaba429bce17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZoomDevelopment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
