The player only needs to operate two buttons to experience the flowing feeling of the flying raft and the sensation of the hitting, which is the unique gameplay of \"Blade Attack\".<br/>\r\nThe art style of the game adopts the traditional Chinese ink-and-wash style. The overall performance of the game is improved on the basis of one, and the style of the picture is changed to Chinese ink, because of the simplicity and freehand features of ink and the core gameplay of the game. The theme of the game is very compatible with the game, which brings a new game experience to the player.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ecdb89f99344f35f12b9f8b66b9d03e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tianhong"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Tianhong"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
