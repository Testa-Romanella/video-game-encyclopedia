The few battles he directed had been won without much test of his mettle. But on the dawn of that fateful Sunday, he found the 45,000 men under his command pressed against the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing, caught in a surprise attack by Confederate General Johnston and his Army of the Mississippi.</h3>\n<p>Thus began the Battle of Shiloh, two murderous days that would be Grant&#39;s first real trial by fire.</p>\n<h3>FOR ALL CIVIL WAR FANS</h3>\n<p>This superb simulation contains three games that are designed to challenge all Civil War fans \u2014 regardless of wargaming experience.<br />\nThe Introductory Game uses simplified rules and options and easy-to-use joystick control to let the novice player jump right into the action.<br />\nThe Intermediate Game serves as a stepping stone to the Advanced Game, where complex decisions and intricate rules create an incredibly detailed and realistic simulation that will satisfy even the most veteran of wargamers.</p>\n<h3>AWARD WINNING GAME SYSTEM</h3>\n<p>This game uses an improved version of the critically acclaimed game system first seen in SSI&#39;s GETTYSBURG: The Turning Point.\u2122 The Battle of Shiloh is faithfully re-created in 15 turns. All brigades historically present at the battle are included, as are the Federal gunboats Lexington and Tyler. The 30x30 square-grid battlefield (also provided as a 4-color mapcard) accurately reflects the terrain around Shiloh.<br />\nA significant refinement is the ability to switch between a strategic and tactical display anytime during play. Another is the inclusion of special morale rules for &quot;green,&quot; untried troops.<br />\nGenerals Grant and Johnston actually appear in the game as army/corps commanders. They can be injured \u2014 or killed (as Johnston was in the real battle).<br />\nDuring solitaire play, the computer can direct either or both sides.</p>\n<h3>HISTORY REPEATED OR REVISED?</h3>\n<p>The Battle of Shiloh was a see-saw affair that could easily have been a Union defeat or victory. Now, you determine the outcome of Grant&#39;s fearsome trial \u2014 and his destiny.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/602ee5ddd560ffbf5ca6bf86b805f9b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Strategic Simulations"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Strategic Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
