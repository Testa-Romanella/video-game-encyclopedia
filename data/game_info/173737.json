It started as a quick game I threw together with assets I had no rights to after about three weeks of working with GameMaker. I decided it was actually decent enough that I'd remake it with assets I could actually use and put it out there\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThis is a simple space shooter with Asteroids style movement. The game throws more and more enemies at you as you clear levels. Maybe there's even a big bad enemy that has a chance to appear. Or maybe not. You'll have to find out\r\n</p>\r\nThe game isn't quite finished\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile pretty much all the core features are there and the game is perfectly playable, there are some things I'd eventually like to implement, among them being:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A high score system</li>\n<li>Greater enemy variety</li>\n<li>Background music. Maybe</li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\n\tW or Up Arrow to propel your ship forward. A/D or Left Arrow/Right Arrow to rotate. Space Bar to fire. With mouse controls enabled, your ship will rotate to look at your mouse pointer. W or Up Arrow to go, Left Mouse Button or Space to fire. This kind of sucks if you're using a laptop pad instead of a mouse\r\n<br/>Press R at any time during play to restart\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14be3482cc36fe193449f391884c757e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antipotato"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
