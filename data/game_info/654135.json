You must build bridges over the writhing void below in order to make your way to the enemy. Towers are built on the islands or off the edges of bridges themselves. Mild RTS elements allow you to build up an army of resource gatherers to fund your war.</p>\n<p>In the end destroy the enemy's castle to destroy their immortality.</p>\n<p><em>This game is in early-access and not a final product. New bug fixes (and new bugs), new features, and\u00a0significant rebalancing should all be anticipated on a regular basis. Your feedback will be heard and appreciated (and will likely lead to one of the former three things happening).</em><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T11:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58a4ac50a776a8dde74f549de509ab2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["duhprey"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
