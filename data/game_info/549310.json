{"id": 549310, "slug": "asteroid-rain-2", "name": "Asteroid Rain", "name_original": "Asteroid Rain", "description": "<p>Asteroid Rain is a game based on one of the first games I ever played: Asteroids. I started this project not only because I liked the\u00a0original\u00a0game\u00a0and its mechanics, which I do, but also to prove to myself that I can finish a project.\u00a0The current aim of the game is to collect as many points as you can. To do so you will need to dodge the asteroids and shooting them down. Hitting an asteroid will cause it break down and drop loot. By hitting the asteroids and collecting the loot you will gain points to accumulate a high score.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game was made in roughly a Game Jam timeframe spread across the last three weeks. I still have some ideas for features and game modes to add to the game. However, due to time constraints and a deadline, set by me, this is what I managed to finish. Features such as more ship customization, enemy ships, a \u2018Defend the mothership\u2019 game mode and better music might be added in the future.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Your feedback would be greatly appreciated :D\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Mouse position: Rotation of ship\r\n  </li><li>Left mouse button: Shoot\r\n  </li><li>W: Move forwards\r\n  </li><li>Shift: Dash forwards\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Have fun playing the game and beating the high score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/44158e64b2a55793ccb7dceddcb1666a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jenkgames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
