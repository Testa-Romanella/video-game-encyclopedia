To win at this game the user must leave<br/>by the exit which is located directly south of where the player spawns. One<br/>of this game's main mecanics is the threat level, inspired by GTA games. It<br/>increases whenever a guard notices a certain amount of items missing. The<br/>higher the threat level, the bigger the angle of the cone of detection, it<br/>reaches further, guards move faster, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:50:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/5071331e1f2178e8b6f5f1c359ff2046.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vincent Fortin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
