You must combine and mix these colors in order to explore all the planets and reach the final color/planet.</p>\n<p>Press Escape or P for the controls. (You can also see the colors you've been)</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay Explanation:</p>\n<p>The initial green and blue planet allow your entrance always. Start by mixing those two. When you mix two colors you get a new one, and unlock the planet with that color.</p>\n<p>Your objective is to mix all colors to get the last color in the tree:\u00a0pink, and get to that planet, where your team will pick you up.</p>\n<p>Bug: The white flower texture is missing, if you press F where the flower should stand (to the right of the planet) it'll still color your player white.</p>\n<p>Color Map Explanation:</p>\n<p>A color has two other colors pointing to it: the combination of those two colors is the color they are both pointing to.</p>\n<p>Any color painted over with white will become white and white painted over with any color will become that color. This is useful to get to a certain color, and then go back in the tree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A color mixed with a color that has no combination will become brown, then you can't with any color, and if you haven't unlocked white, you basically lost.</p>\n\n<p>A game made for BTPGameJam under the theme \"Mini Planets\".</p>\n<p>Used BitPotion font:\u00a0https://joebrogers.itch.io/bitpotion</p>\n<p>Developed by me,</p>\n<p>romes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83eb39d9392b45e98b11d2a2f6bfb762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["romes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
