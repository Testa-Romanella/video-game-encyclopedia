I don't usually work with characters who aren't my own, so forgive me for any inconsistencies. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is best played with headphones. It is rated PG-13.</p>\n<p>It takes about 20-30 minutes to complete <em>(though it can be much shorter if you're clicking too fast, which I don't recommend)</em> and was made in 3 days with the help of NomnomNami, who makes amazing games you should all go play!</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf59 About the Artist \ud83c\udf59\r\n<p>I'm DCS! <br/></p>\n<p>ART BLOG (18+ ONLY) -- ZOSAN BLOG (18+ ONLY)</p>\n<p>If you like this game, and you like ZoSan, please check out some of the comics I've made between these two!
