Still, he dreams of a man who could take all that he has to offer.</p>\n<p>Sexuality: Gay</p>\n<p>Package size: Destroyer Of Worlds</p>\n\n<p>Gary:</p>\n\n<p>At one point Gary got simply tired of his high-stress job and quit. Now he makes his living by renting out a unit in the duplex he owns, and takes each day as it comes. He usually comes off as both blunt and intelligent, which can intimidate those around him.\u00a0And that's just the way he likes it.</p>\n<p>Sexuality:\u00a0Bi</p>\n<p>Package size: Just right</p>\n\n<p>Erin:</p>\n\n<p>Erin is the most kind-hearted bimbo in the universe. Or in words even he would understand\u00a0- he's really nice, but also really stupid. He loves football, cats, baking, video games, and spending time with his friends. Erin is completely oblivious when it comes to sex, and gets flustered at a mere mention of anything dirty.</p>\n<p>Sexuality: Straight (???)</p>\n<p>Package size: thicc</p>\n\n\n<p>This is currently a very short demo of the game.\u00a0Seriously, I'm not being humble here, there's really not much to see at this point. I have decided to make this game for the BARA JAM 2019, but when I joined there were only 11 days left. In that time, I have worked on this game in every spare moment I had, but it is still very, VERY far from anywhere near done. I will keep working on it in my free time, and upload the finished version as soon as it's ready (or perhaps I'll upload updates periodically, depending on the interest).\u00a0</p>\n<p>What can you expect from the finished game you ask?</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm planning on creating at least 50 CGs, with a lot of branching and optional events.\u00a0The game will have 6 endings minimum, but I might add more if I feel like destroying myself.</p>\n<p>Some other things that you will find in this game in the future:</p>\n<p>- Music. Right now the game is completely silent, but I am planning on creating a soundtrack from scratch. It's going to be pretty simple, but I hope it will still add some more atmosphere to the experience.</p>\n<p>- More sprites. There currently aren't many expressions and variants for the sprites, but I already have many more of them in the works.</p>\n<p>- Animations, possibly. I was actually working on animating the existing sprites in this game, but my computer did not like that at all. Once I betray my computer and replace him for a newer model, I want to go back to animating the characters and backgrounds as well.</p>\n<p>- Two more major characters that were not introduced in the demo. These two characters will also be \"romanceable\" (that means you can sleep with them. Multiple times. But yes, you can also build a relationship with them if you're so inclined.) Spoiler - one of them is a tough daddy and the other one is a sweet trans man. You're gonna love 'em.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- More sturdiness. I'm planning on programming the game in either Unity or Ren'Py - at the moment I'm playing around with both options, trying to figure out which will suit me and my goals better. This will give me more tools and options to build the game just the way I want it.</p>\n<p>- CG Gallery, so that you can go back to all the important parts of the game, and think about them deeply in your spare time.</p>\n<p>Oh, and did I mention that the game will always stay free? Yeah. I mean it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you think you might enjoy the game, I invite you to share your thoughts with me either here or over at tumblr. As this is my first game and I am developing it completely by myself, I always welcome feedback of any kind! And who knows, if you have something you'd like to see in the game, I might be able to work it in ;).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/157ef6c330f692296a6a213074f33b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Touha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
