Some contain short experiences: playable practical jokes, maybe. Some are little finishable\u00a0arcade games or platformers.\u00a0A few of the thirty-one are confounding puzzle-boxes that might even\u00a0last you an hour or two each.</p>\n<p>It's my hope that these games capture a little bit of the feeling of getting a bunch of unmarked games from a stranger.\u00a0However, if you'd like a detailed look at\u00a0what you're getting before picking this up, browse this Twitter thread of all 31 games as they were developed:\u00a0\u00a0#droqtober Thread</p>\n<p>* The cover art of all the cassettes is by a pixabay user named Bru-nO.
