Short story:</p>\n<p>Damn, the object has escaped, we need to find a way out, but it's probably closed, we need to turn on the backup power. It's good that the lights are powered by emergency power. Walking along the wires, I will be able to reach the transformer and turn it on, after which I will need to find the gate in this fog, in theory they are somewhere on the edge of the territory. To know where the object is, I will use a walkie-talkie, because the object as a result of experiments received invisibility and the ability to influence electrical appliances, the closer I get to it, the louder the noise from the walkie-talkie should be. Theoretically, he can be seen in the dark, thanks to the light from his collar, which was supposed to destroy the object in case of emergency situations, but the object got out of control and broke the collar, although it is possible by bringing the object close to the transformer and turning it on, with a surge of energy I can make the collar work and it will destroy the object. In any case, it is necessary to leave, but if anything, I think it will be possible to return here, because the object is now more animal than human, and it will probably return to the cage itself.</p><p><strong>Minimum system requirements:</strong></p><p>2 Core CPU</p><p>GTX 980m<br/></p><p><strong>Recomended:</strong></p><p>4 Core CPU\r\n</p>\n<p>RTX 3050</p>\n<p><strong>Language: Ru/Eng</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for trailer: gesugao_27</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T15:40:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff457829f427680563f86f73a59bf556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Art Om"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
