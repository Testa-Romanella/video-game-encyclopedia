We apologize if your computer can't run it; it's not your computer, it's us. A couple things that can make a big difference are decreasing the quality settings and running the game in a smaller window.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be9076eedc7dde400063d426cb188beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ecmjohnson", "CloseCall Studios", "pullthestrings"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
