At first I wanted the game to be easier but soon realized the game was already too easy. Instead of adding power ups, I added a boost mechanic, that can help, but also slow the players down.</p><p>For my first multiplayer game, I wanted to create an experience that is unique to me. I choose to focus more on the technical aspects (coding), as opposed to the art. I came across a few challenges. They presented themselves in unexpected ways; the physics make the vehicles feel float, not enough time to troubleshoot, and shiny textures. It took a few days to fix the physics problem; it is quite tame now. Originally I wanted to add more textures, and create procedural generated cars and tracks, but there I will continue this in the future.</p><p> <strong>UPDATES:</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Fine tuned controls</strong></p><p><strong>Field of Vision for players</strong></p><p><strong>Updated Track</strong></p><p><strong>Updated Vehicle</strong></p><p><strong>Optimized Graphics</strong></p><p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p><p><strong>Player collisions </strong></p><p><strong>Respawn Point </strong></p><p><strong>Terrain has been locked off </strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bb/4bb131fa0c4c6b9ee960b15619ad1f3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DocShaq"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
