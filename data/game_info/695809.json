Symmetry has hired the Enforcers, their private mercenaries, to ensure their strict regulations are carried out by all citizens living in their territory. Currently, Hydro Rapids City and its city limits are under their control. Symmetry knew of the city\u2019s previous difficulties with passing various laws and dealing with steadily increased crime rates, so they swooped in just in time with a deal that would hand the keys over to them and define the beginnings of a grime era.<br/><br/>The council, promising diminished problems and safer streets, instead served up a fresh plate of misery and boredom for all that live in the city. Their harsh restrictions make it difficult for the civilians to enjoy themselves. Ironically, crimes such as secret pizza parties and soda smuggling have skyrocketed, soaring higher than \u201creal\u201d crimes. With the city\u2019s hopes dying day by day, local college athlete and party thrower Brooke Atomica plans to reignite her city\u2019s flames with her awesome arsenal of crazy weapons and agile platforming. It\u2019s up to her to bring down Symmetry\u2019s devious plans to crush all things fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T03:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d589a65840e4d3e4406d847e1a40ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlyBalto"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SlyBalto"], "esrb_rating": null}
