This intangible \u2018time shadow\u2019 is locked in the past but the objects it creates to relive the player\u2019s actions aren\u2019t. Using this, the player is forced to complete puzzles like a lab rat for the malicious purposes of SERN, a\u00a0mega company which uses its scientific research mask to guise their actual intentions of controlling time to further their members socially and economically.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a project I made two years ago but I hadn't uploaded to here and I\u00a0always thought this was probably my coolest idea (though the game definitely needs better levels)\u00a0so I thought I might as well put it up anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7ed37b1714f1d4aa9c8ff00dab9a5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KrabGor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
