Every day, she walks the same path, doing her chores, and only allowed out when she\u2019s running her errands. For as long as she could remember, the only parts of the forest she\u2019d ever seen were the worn path to her grandmother\u2019s house, the sawdust-lined walkway to the lumber mill, and the inside of her cottage home. Crimson just wanted to explore the forest and find out more about what was beyond it.</p>\n<p>Luckily for her, her nineteenth birthday was only a week away.</p>\n<p>On her birthday, Grandma was going to answer all of her questions and tell her why her mother was so superstitious of wolves.

Crimson could stay out of trouble for five days, right?</p>\n<p>However, odd things begin happening before the big day arrives. Strange women pop out of the trees, the lumberjacks start keeping their distance, and the forest feels like an entirely new place, calling to her. Crimson is all too ready to experience the new and exciting night life awaiting her, throwing herself into her new friends and their quirks and interests.
