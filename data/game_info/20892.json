Although sales were stopped soon after the game\u2019s release, The Great Giana Sisters became a cult classic, and Giana an iconic part of video game history. <br/>In 2009, we started a reboot of Giana Sisters and released it on Nintendo DS. Giana Sisters DS marked the beginning of a new series of Giana Sisters games, with Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams and Giana Sisters: Dream Runners being the latest releases. <br/>Now we\u2019re happy to give you a HD remake of the 2009 Nintendo DS version on Steam. It features beautiful HD graphics and full controller support. And of course the precise controls, intuitive handling and a smooth learning curve that platform fans expect. All balanced for hours of fun and challenges. It also contains the 32 levels of the original game \u2013 restored with love and care to resemble our take on the retro aesthetic. <br/><br/>Freed from the dust of decades, Giana Sisters 2D retains its cherished style, familiar features and the legendary original soundtrack in a fresh revision. <br/><br/><ul><li>Beautifully restored HD Remake of the Nintendo DS classic.<br/></li><li>Sharp, intuitive controls and an easy learning curve.<br/></li><li>Lovingly crafted modern take on retro graphics in HD.<br/></li><li>80 completely new adventures.<br/></li><li>32 fully restored classic levels will put a tear in the eye of many fans of the original version!<br/></li><li>Legendary soundtrack, inspired by Chris Huelsbeck.<br/></li><li>Customizable controls and full controller support.<br/></li><li>Steam integration: leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T18:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8cc1c668e0e0604f39d26c3ee60c628.jpg", "website": "http://giana-sisters.com/", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 122, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kasaa Solution"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HandyGames", "Black Forest Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
