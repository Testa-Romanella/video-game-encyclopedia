Biting deals less damage, but recovers some health, while scratching deals more damage.<br/>Killing a mouse will also recover some health.<br/>You will always attack the first enemy.</p>\n<p>Between battles, you can spend some of your health to upgrade your attack power or your life sapping, which will increase the amount of health you receive from biting and killing enemies.<br/>But don't spend too much, or you might get killed.</p>\n<p>There is no victory, but you can always try to bea your high score.</p>\n<p>I didn't really have much time to invest in this LD, so I settled for something reall minimalistic.<br/>I also reused some art assets from a previous game jam game about Void that I didn't finish ;) So no voting on graphics.</p>\n<p>Technology:<br/>Unity, Gimp.</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>\"Volatile Reaction\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e2/0e20fe569017dce69c57ec966e54d6f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrMadCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
