It's released now (early 2017) with no additional <em>development</em>, opting simply to fix some bugs preventing the game from launching and releasing as-is. This project is considered \"complete\", though this is primarily due to the fact that this project was created naively to learn a Python module. Current functionality is building blocks (with a limited store), texture pack support, and killing enemies with a (poor) combat system. <strong>I would regard this to be a prototype, not a release game.</strong><br/>\n</p><p>If you'd like to play it, go ahead. I will not be supporting this game, however.</p><p>Oh, and I haven't recompiled it: to play it, you'll need to run the source. The source is at https://github.com/Scratso/PythianRealms. Sorry.</p><br/>\nOverview:<p>\r\n\tPythianRealms is a free-to-play construction game. You are spawned into the world as a hero - but nobody believes you! You must fight fierce battles and strengthen up to earn your deserved respect. But in order to keep alive during battles were death is imminent, you need armour! As you explore unique realms and lands, you will uncover different clothing and tools. There are even relics - special items with mysterious powers - which can both aid you, or hurt you.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tPythianRealms by Damian Heaton is licensed under a \r\n\tCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Damian Heaton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
