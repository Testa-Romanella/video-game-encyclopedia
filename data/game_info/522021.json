Every year you must to collect the nectar from the flowers and feed your colony.</p>\n<p>Also, you pollinize the fields and new flowers will grow every year!!!

Every year are more dangerous, and the hive depends on you.</p>\n<p>How many springs can you survive before the worlds end?</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This game is not fair at all. You are just a bee (or a couple of them, hive-mind, bro :P). You have no control over pollution, climate change any invading species. You're being exterminated. If you die, flowers won't be pollinized; and no flowers, no life. Just survive as many springs as you can. Then, when the last of you die, a lot of things will change. That's the sad true. Everything else is funny.
