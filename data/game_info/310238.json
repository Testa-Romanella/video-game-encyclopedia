{"id": 310238, "slug": "3some", "name": "3some", "name_original": "3some", "description": "<p>3some was created for the Linux Game Jam 2019. It's based on\u00a03some JS, which I've written a few years ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>I've made this game using L\u00d6VE 11.2 on Linux. It should work fine with L\u00d6VE 11.x on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. I've also tried it on Android, but at least on my tablet L\u00d6VE seems to run not-so-stable and battery-unefficient.</p><strong>Rules:</strong><br/>\n<p>There are 81 unique cards that differ by four criteria: number, color, shape and fill of the shown symbols. 15 cards are shown at the same time. Find out three of them in which each of the four criteria are either all the same or completely different. Such a matching set of three cards is called a \"3some\" (or threesome). If you found one, it will be removed and you get three new cards. This goes on until either all 81 cards are used or it is impossilbe to find another 3some.</p>\n<p>If you are new to this game and have problems finding a matching 3some, the hint button helps you (for a small time penalty of course).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game can be controlled <strong>completely with mouse</strong>. But as an alternative you can also use the keyboard:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>F5</strong> or\u00a0<strong>n</strong> - start a new game</li><li><strong>Esc</strong> or <strong>p</strong> - pause the game</li><li><strong>F1</strong> or <strong>h</strong> - get a hint for the next move</li><li><strong>F8</strong> or <strong>r</strong> - show the rules/help</li><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> - move the card marker</li><li><strong>Return</strong> or <strong>Space</strong> - (de)select a card</li><li><strong>F7</strong> or <strong>s</strong> - (de)activate sound</li><li><strong>F11</strong> or <strong>f</strong> - toggle fullscreen</li><li><strong>F9</strong>, <strong>i</strong> or <strong>a</strong> - about the game</li><li><strong>F10</strong>,\u00a0<strong>x</strong> or <strong>q</strong> - quit the game</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Legal info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
