Sorry, we prefer to keep night vision google for elite commandos.<br/>Oh, I forgot to tell you, you may encounter some interferences, don't worry, it will not harass you after your death.<br/>Last point, I hope your sonar computer is a Lynx 2 model, or you will not be able to experiment sonar tracking for monsters (it's not that it is 100% needed, but I guess knowing there is a monster on your right or your left could be useful - I don't know, I never volunteered for a silly mission like this...).</p>\n<p>Good luck, and remember, there is no shame to give up, as long as nobody else knows...</p>\n<p>So it is quite easy, you are in a labyrinth and you must find the exit.\r\n</p>\n<p>Graphisms are in your head, so if you want the game\u00a0to be a FPS in 4K resolution, that's all good, but as you play in the dark, the screen only displays your compass and remaining time (you only have 9 minutes to escape).</p>\n\n<p><em>(yes, this is the main ingame screen)</em></p>\n<p>Gameplay mostly use sounds via your sonar. When your sonar hit an obstacle (wall, teleportation gate), it makes a sound. If the sonar hit a monster, the monster will shout. Time between sounds depends of distance, so if you move too fast, you may miss some important informations.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are also some other sound informations, like your heart (when time decrease, you heart rate increase), electromagnetic perturbations (also visibles on screen), and sometimes, if a monster see you from profile, it shouts (so from left or right as game use stereo).\r\n</p>\n<p>The good thing is that all sonar impacts, and your moves are recorded, so it may be helpful.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>How to play\u00a0:<br/>up : move forward<br/>down : move backward<br/>left/right : rotate<br/>Button A/B : strafe<br/>Option 1 : display computer screen (be careful, time is still flying when you look at computer, there is no pause)</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, we wan't take the risk to give you a weapon, imagine what a monster could do to us with an\u00a0ALK-97 after your death...\r\n</p>\n<p>But, there is a\u00a0good news: monsters can't move, at least, we are pretty sure they don't move, and nobody came back to tell us\u00a0they move...\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are 4 difficulty modes, and from 1 to 8 level\u00a0(a labyrinth) in each mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can choose the 1st level you want to play, and you will always have 9 minutes to escape (so if you choose Very Easy/1 you have 9' to go throught 8 levels, and if you choose Very Easy/8, you still have 9' to go through level 8 ).</p>\n\n<p>What could be improve/done in future\u00a0releases :<br/>- better monster shouting (for information, I'm using ABC Music for all sounds, not found an accurate shout yet)<br/>- add legs to monsters<br/>- add brain to monsters</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be99cd5739edad9a536a876fe31c214e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fadest"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
