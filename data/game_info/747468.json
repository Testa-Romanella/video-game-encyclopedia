Of course</p>\n<p>there were some minor issues, but usually these could be easily overcome</p>\n<p>with a little mutual understanding. This all changed when the farmers let</p>\n<p>greed into their hearts, wanting more and more profit with no regard for</p>\n<p>other species. Gradually dragons became obstacles rather than allies in the</p>\n<p>eyes of the farmers, and had to be eliminated. And so the war began.</p>\n<p>You are a female dragon, living in a cave in the vicinity of a small</p>\n<p>village. From here fifteen farmers tracked you down and now, armed with</p>\n<p>sticks, want to destroy your eggs. The only way to protect your offspring</p>\n<p>is by spitting fire balls at the attackers.</p>\n<p>PRESS 1-5 TO SPIT, where the number indicates the force with which this is</p>\n<p>done.</p>\n<p>At first the farmers are somewhat cautious. But whenever you hit one, the</p>\n<p>next one will be more daring. If a farmer reaches your eggs, then you lose</p>\n<p>the game. But should you manage to kill all fifteen of them, you will win.</p>\n\n<p>--- Code Explanation ---</p>\n<p>Line 0: Read data for the following strings:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Segment of the dragon's neck, pile of eggs and farmer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a loop:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Build the complete neck string, read and assemble the segment</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 strings of the dragon's head and build a vertical orientation</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 string.</p>\n<p>Line 1: Set the background colour to black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To save space further along in the program, set a variable to</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 screen memory.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set character colour to yellow before clearing the screen, so that</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 a POKEd character on screen is immediately yellow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Display the number of killed farmers, the pile of eggs, the neck</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and the head of the dragon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the farmer's horizontal position variable to the far left.</p>\n<p>Line 2: Randomly calculate a new value for the farmer's horizontal</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 position. As the game progresses, the chance of this value being</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 forwards increases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If this value is greater than zero then assign it to the farmer's</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 horizontal position variable and display the farmer.</p>\n<p>Line 3: Set a string variable to hold the victory text.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Read the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the fire mode is clear, then determine the value of the key</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 pressed.
