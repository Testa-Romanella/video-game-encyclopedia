Mimir can be your virtual GM for solo play, act as GM for you and your friends, or provide endless inspiration for busy GM's or creative writers who could use a nudge to get their creative juices flowing. <br/><br/>Mimir works for any fantasy RPG, including Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds and Strands of Fate.<br/><br/>Mimir is...<br/><br/>* An oracle for solo and group play. By asking yes/no questions and using the inspiration tools, introduction prompts and scenario complications, Mimir can help guide you though a story of your own making, while injecting just enough drama to keep you on your toes.<br/><br/>* A ambient sound player to help set the mood.<br/><br/>* A random NPC generator that intelligently generates a huge array of physical traits, background details, behaviors, motivations, methodologies, etc. These NPCs can then be customized, and you can save your favorites to recall and edit later.<br/><br/>* A Detail Generator; in addition to the inspirational guidance that accompanies each yes/no answer, there is also a page dedicated to providing additional detail that further define places, objects and situations.<br/><br/>* A Random Table Generator and Roller. You can also use Mimir to create your own random tables, organizing your entries based on Common, Uncommon and Rare tags. Once your table is created, you can select it to pull a random selection based on rarity. <br/><br/>Mimir is formatted for both iPhone and iPad, and works especially well in split screen on iPad.<br/><br/>Note: Page selections visible in iPad screenshots are from Strands of Fate 2nd Edition, which is not included.
