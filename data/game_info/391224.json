Only falling.\r\n<p>Serious Scramblers is a fast-paced vertical platformer where you can't jump.

Here are some examples:<br/><br/><strong>Motoko - Time jumper</strong><br/>Like a certain innovative FPS, time only moves when Motoko moves. There is a catch however, the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn't paused - so, unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes, you'll have to make each move carefully!</p>\n<p><strong>Silhouette - Gotta go fast</strong><br/>Silhouette moves at top speed at all times, so avoiding spike traps is as easy as A, B, and C! However, the trade-off is that there will be significantly lesser gold coins to collect.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mummy - Gold Grabber</strong><br/>Fancy getting more coins to unlock more characters? Mummy's the one to choose. It's worth noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though!</p>\n<br/>Join our community", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca51f61cb2f4b99b43584821a3880a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chinykian"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
