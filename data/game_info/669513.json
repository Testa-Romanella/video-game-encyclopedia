The resolution and palette of the TIC-80 <em>operating system</em> cannot be modified to suit the rules of the jam. However, the <em>game</em> itself <strong>does </strong>follow all the rules. Pressing Escape will bring up the TIC-80's built in menu - this should also not be considered part of the entry as it part of the engine and cannot be modified.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>ATTRIBUTION</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Particle effects library based on code by Viza, freely available on tic80.com and used with permission.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c70b3dcb50db6c957bc84fc32d4d62d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jf1x"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
