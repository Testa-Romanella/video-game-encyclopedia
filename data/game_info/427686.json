But he is not a hero. Because Peter is a fool.<br />\nA fool who looked for a brighter place, a better future, and found himself living on scraps and stolen goods. A fool who wanted to go beyond what his birthplace offered and found the shadows of a corporate-owned world. A fool who, for some reason or another, still tries to get a better life while clinging to his aspirations.<br />\nSo, Peter is not a hero. But, for the right woman\u2026 he can fake it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Especially for our STEAM release we have prepared some extras:<br />\n- 3 new animations<br />\n- gallery of already achieved erotic scenes<br />\n- endings gallery<br />\n- gallery with bonus images as a reward for completing game at least 4 times</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cBeneath Steel Clouds\u201d is a life-sim set in a dystopian future with a cyberpunk aesthetic and themes but without the gritty, grim-dark tone and with a healthy dose of snark added on top.
