Some may even find some scenes in the game to be disturbing or upsetting. Proceed at your own risk.<br/><br/>Traum is a short, story-driven adventure with psychological horror elements. It encourages the player to explore as interacting with objects reveals more about the world, the story, and the main character himself. Many of the objects can be interacted with multiple times and some items trigger flashback memories of days past. During the gameplay there are also choices that will affect some future events. <br/><br/>Traum has no combat as it relies on suspense, atmosphere, and storytelling. The game has multiple endings where the player must rely on their past interactions to make the choice. Traum also has fully custom character artwork and music.<br/><br/><strong>Plot</strong><br/><br/>You're Mike, a common man who had it all planned out. A loving wife, a house and a steady income.
