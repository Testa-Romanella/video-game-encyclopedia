Demons from hell took this opportunity to exploit the tower, invading heaven through it. A three-way battle between humans, demons and gods ensued. The gods then destroyed the tower&amp;#39;s summit and cast seals on it, closing the path to heaven. Wars continue to rage on earth and mankind is at the brink of extinction.
