I noticed that\u00a0<br/>-Large Halbert now has a Dynamic Kill.\u00a0When the Pilot has 30 Health or less. The character is able to increase the roll, to go for an instant kill. They would need to roll a 6d9 to do it.\u00a0<br/>-You can now rip people out of their Mecha! They'll need to be Lowered health, this can be anywhere between 20/10/ or in the 30's. I put it vague for a reason because, I wanted people to have fun with it.\u00a0<br/>-I did add some more EN moves, nine actually.\u00a0Everything else is pretty much the same, except for the added and organized EN moves.
