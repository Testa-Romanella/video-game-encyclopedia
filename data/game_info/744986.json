(gjs1025)", "description": "<p>This is my 2D Shooter Project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<p>1) I completed a complete interesting, comprehensive, and coherent level. I added levels 3, 4, and 5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) I added multiple additional levels and tied them in to create a logical progression in my game. For example, in level 3 I added 1 diagonal chasing, 1 straight chasing, 1 straight shooter, and 1 diagonal shooter. In level 4 I kept everything from level 3, but added 1 straight shooter and 1 diagonal shooter in addition. In level 5 I kept everything from level 4, but added 1 diagonal chasing and 1 straight chasing in addition. In each level, the amount of enemies to defeat increases. For instance, there are\u00a03\u00a0enemies to defeat in level 1, 5\u00a0enemies to defeat in level 2, 7\u00a0enemies to defeat in level 3, 9\u00a0enemies to defeat in level 4, and 11\u00a0enemies to defeat in level 5.</p>\n<p>3) I modified the out of game menus in a few different ways. I changed the main menu UI backdrop color to pink, I changed the colors of the main menu buttons, and I changed the name of the game on the main menu to \"Galaxy Attack!\".</p>\n<p>These are all design modifications.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Grace Semaan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:51:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3d51844593078f7906b8a5a7861ac3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gjs1025"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
