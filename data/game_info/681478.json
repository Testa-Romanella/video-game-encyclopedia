(Syndicate for Terror and Illegal Non-Government, voted the world\u2019s #1 terrorist organization.) Did you ever want GI Joe with vampires? Well now you can have it, buddy!<br/><br/>BATS is a throwback to the action sidescrollers of the 16-bit era, with a modern twist. It\u2019s a fast-paced, arcade brawler-shooter-slasher that rewards precision play and pixel-perfect timing. Play like a pro or take your time running around killing terrorists, slicing off heads and sucking up blood at your own pace. It\u2019s up to you! Either way, you\u2019re gonna have a bloody good time.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>There are five hand-crafted levels of STING\u2019s fortress for the player to explore. Each level is filled with dangerous traps, deadly hazards, and an endless supply of Scorp soldiers to slice and dice into bloody bits.<br/><br/>As players progress through the levels they will collect blood droplets, which can be used to activate super deadly vampire powers, making the wholesale slaughter of disposable soldiers a breeze!<br/><br/>But watch out, there\u2019s still plenty of swinging saw blades, terrorist zombies, and electrocution chambers to navigate. And don\u2019t forget the STING sauna! <br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/><br/>The Bloodsucker Anti-Terror Squad is a secret government organization that fights crime...one bite at a time! There are five playable characters in the game. Players start as BATS leader, Count Bloodvayne, and unlock the other members of the team as they complete each level.<br/><br/>Count Bloodvayne<br/>This Victorian-era vampire was once a detective for Scotland Yard. While on the hunt for Jack the Ripper, he was bitten by a creature of the night and transformed into Count Bloodvayne, vampire of justice! Count Bloodvayne can transform into a wolf, killing enemies with ease.<br/><br/>Sgt. Sabre<br/>Sabre\u2019s mother was bitten by a vampire when he was in utero. Half human, half vampire, and all muscle, Sgt. Sabre swings his mighty blade to slice terrorists into little meat chunks. When he\u2019s powered up, Sabre spins like a whirlwind to decimate his foes.<br/><br/>Mitzie<br/>Once your average millennial suburban kid, Mitzie\u2019s encounter with an organic, artisanal, hand-crafted protein shake from Bavaria transformed her into a winged bloodsucker of vengeance! Her flying abilities make her the most maneuverable of the team.<br/><br/>Rick Ghastley<br/>Rick was a member of the 90s boy band sensation, Boyz Town. But a run-in with a sexy vampire groupie turned his thirst for love into a thirst for blood! Rick uses a deadly shotgun to blast the bad guys to bits. He\u2019s also working on a comeback album.<br/><br/>Nosferadude<br/>No one knows how old Nosferadude is, or where he comes from, or even if \u201che\u201d is a he. But one thing is clear, Nosferadude is agile and a dangerous predator. He collects more blood than anyone else on the team, making his vampire rage even more deadly!<br/><br/>Squirt<br/>Every team needs a mascot, and Squirt is the bat with the can-do attitude that makes the team go! Finding Squirt will protect any BATS member from one hit.<br/><br/>Scorpion Supreme<br/>Scorpion Supreme is the ruthless leader of STING, voted the world\u2019s #1 terrorist organization. With pincers for hands and a venomous tail, Scorpion Supreme is Count Bloodvayne\u2019s greatest foe. He also has a terrible temper, always killing his trusted Scorp minions for screwing up.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><ul><li>Five levels to master<br/></li><li>Five characters to unlock<br/></li><li>Boss Rush mode - test your skillz!<br/></li><li>Speedrun mode - go for the record!<br/></li><li>Realistic BloodEFX technology<br/></li><li>Historically accurate vampire powers<br/></li><li>Hilarious and unfortunate deaths<br/></li><li>Thousands of screams</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T05:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/38100185dba41a9a95a4dab396191025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Ritual Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The MIX Games", "One Eyed Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
