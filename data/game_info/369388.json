This game was considered as one of the most addictive casual game in mobile history and therefore was removed from the Play Store and the App Store due to its addictiveness. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Responsive Design (Mobile-Friendly)</li><li>Most-Accurate Replica of the Original Flappy Bird</li><li>Local Saving for High Scores</li><li>Pause and Mute Buttons (Which is missing in the original game)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>\n<p>This game is obviously a clone and was recreated from scratch.
