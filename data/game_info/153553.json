In the original code there was literally just about nothing to do, and the descriptions were confusing--I hadn't implemented anything to tell you when something that you saw to the south was now visible in the southwest, so it was impossible to tell where anything was. So I implemented that, and some other things, and created a bunch of things to see in the plain.
