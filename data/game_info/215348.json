But what it does do (very well, I think), is force me to make a decision: will I continue to engage, even though I\u00a0KNOW\u00a0it\u2019s fruitless, or will I give up? And that question, I think, is profound. Because that\u00a0IS\u00a0what loneliness feels like: a never ending pattern of rejection. A hopeless state which will not change. And the only choices are to despair (to move, alone, into the dark), or to continue to pour out energy in what we believe (what we feel we\u00a0KNOW) to be a pointless endeavor. What I loved about the game was that it demonstrated that, despite my knowledge of futility, I couldn\u2019t choose isolation.\"<br/>-AmelMag,\u00a0NG\u00a0Comments\r\nOn the flip\u00a0side:\r\n\"Ye gods, it\u2019s not emo sixth form poetry these days is it, it\u2019s dreadful indie games.\"<br/>-Kate S,\u00a0Twitter\r\n\"So grauenhaft wie das und seine anderen Spiele programmiert sind, glaube ich eher dass er diese \"schlichte\" Aufmachung leider nur w\u00e4hlt weil er es nicht besser kann.\"<br/>-Besucher2778,\u00a0Spreeblick.com\r\n\"The meta-game reason for it aside; it does have nice music and visuals, but you can\u2019t use \u2018minimalist\u2019 as an excuse for not having any real content. There\u2019d be many ways to take some time and actually give it a point beyond the meta-game point to it. Games can have meanings and messages beyond just being a \u2018game,\u2019 but a game must have some sort of rules and goals to it to fulfill its primary purpose as a game. Without that, it doesn\u2019t matter the reasoning or point to it, it\u2019ll just be dull.\"<br/>-Pyrewraith,\u00a0Kongregate\r\n\"Lame as fuck.\"<br/>-Greg,\u00a0IndieGames.com comments", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2a2ae9cb4a921dcec72ff7a4bd15a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jordan Magnuson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
