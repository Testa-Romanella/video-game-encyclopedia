The only one who knows the truth is Intel-3k, the ships android. Take on the roll of captain and use your resources wisely to everyone back home and you back to your life.</p>\n<p>This was made for GoedWare Jam #7 for the theme Alternate Reality and constraint Time is Power. Time is power is incorporated by the ships fuel being made from extracting\u00a0the remaining life span of plants from the ship's conservatory. I had to cut this game short and leave out some features, so this is more of a demo/prototype than a full game.</p><p>Sound track:</p>\n<p>Loading screen loop</p>\n<p>Author: Brandon Morris</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/loading-screen-loop</p>\n<p>Visuals:</p>\n<p>Science Officer</p>\n<p>Author: Justin Nichol</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/science-officer</p>\n<p>Starship Security Officer</p>\n<p>Author: Justin Nichol</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/starship-security-officer</p>\n<p>The Husk- Human Analog Android</p>\n<p>Author: Justin Nichol</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/the-husk-human-analog-android</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi Background (modifications were made)</p>\n<p>Author: hassekf</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-background</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T07:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8aa7b541c729ed2b50018b888f9de34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kobato Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
