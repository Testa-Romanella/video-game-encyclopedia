A perfectly good refrigerator, just because you weren't \"in season\u201d. That day, as you stood up from the ditch on that Indiana roadside, you swore you would have revenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You lived on the streets, thieving to survive, trading stolen jewellery and doing jobs for the mob, all to afford a few cans of refrigerant. One day, 2 years ago, you felt the time had come. You arrived at McMerica\u2019s mansion with a pistol in doorhandle, but he had security, and you barely made it out with your life. As you walked down the back-alley, rain crashing down, thunder snapping in the distance, you knew you needed more firepower. A visit to Danny the Dishwasher\u2019s got you what you needed. A minigun. Your enemies stood no chance. You collected three more weapons: a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher and a flamethrower. And a few weeks ago, the last piece fell into your hands. An experimental energy shield module.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You boarded Flight LA1337, and touched down in Saigon, riding on the back of a military convoy into the jungle. In the dead of night, you kick down the gate to the base, and open fire on the two sentries. You smile to yourself, your time has come. McMerica will not get away.<br/></p>\n<p>Then a tree crashes down behind you. Your escape is blocked. A trap. There\u2019s no getting away. The tale of Pew-Bot 9000 ends here. But you\u2019ll take as many of McMerica\u2019s men with you as you can, until every last part of your body stops working.</p><p><em>Mac and Linux builds are untested due to lack of hardware.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/edeb51a6b85f4ed2991a642635c32fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["slightlylessepicgames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
