So, to that extent please keep in mind that the project is unfinished, and may never get finished regardless of my own personal plans for it (which are to keep working on it)</p>\n\n<p>Features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Simulated Newtonian Gravity, which allows for complex orbits.</li><li>An in-depth statistics window that shows the state of the simulation at any point in time</li><li>Simulation tools for editing, adding, moving, and deleting\u00a0the various celestial bodies and objects in the simulation.</li><li>Orbit previews and a \"live update\" mode that will attempt to calculate the orbits as the planets move (WIP)</li></ul>\n<p>Known Bugs/Issues:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\"Live orbit\" mode gives erroneous results, that don't match the originally predicted orbit.</li><li>When selecting a planet using the edit tool, sometimes you have to click an object twice for it to actually be selected</li><li>After placing a body using the \"add\" tool, setting the velocity doesn't work</li><li>Settings menu is blank</li></ul>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth look at the development, find the Trello board here</p>\n<p>For planned features, it's best to look the Trello as that will be the most up-to-date place.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!\u00a0Please feel free to give me some feedback or if you find a bug I'd appreciate you leaving a comment letting me know how to reproduce it\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e190dc6f6707031c84beb900a74a724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Roberts"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
