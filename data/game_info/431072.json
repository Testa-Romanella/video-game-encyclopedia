The longer your crew are alive, the more points you get.</p>\n<p>To steer your ship, you must place down gravity wells; these will attract your ship to allow you to turn but be careful - you will lose if you crash into them!<br/></p>\n<p>Planets will also allow your ship to turn however these are less predictable and you have no control over them.</p>\n<p>You can fire your engines to escape from orbits or increase your ship's velocity but use your fuel carefully, if it runs out you will be unable to use your engines.</p>\n<p>Bubbles of fuel and air can be found floating in space, these can be used to refill the respective meter.</p>\n<p>If you run out of air, you lose as your crew suffocate.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 46.
