The goal is to create a digital time machine to learn about and collect your personal selection of toys over several years in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p>This is a work in progress. I've been working on it for two months.\r\n</p>\n<p>I will continue to add things to it in two categories.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Content to be add in ongoing stages (forever?)\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>More years: each year will be represented as al the toys games and movies in the stores. The current state is set in 1984 and some of 1985 with naturally left over 1983-1980 in what can be considered as a rolling clearance aisle.\r\n</li><li>Opening toys: As of now this is not available but I'd like to have all toys be able to be opened, posed in various states and \"stuck\" to all flat surfaces in the customizable bedroom. Of course this all is reliant on procuring or creating each toys model.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Features to be added as soon as possible\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movies, Magazines and Comics: a cbr reader/video player in vr so to \u00a0speak. Pointed to a folder of your own collection.\r\n</li><li>Multiplayer: Invite friends and strangers to your room and allow them to interact with your things and chat or not.\r\n</li><li>Survival RPG mode: Players will need to earn money by doing jobs. Hardcore mode will also require you to drink eat and sleep to stay alive. Making you choose between living another day and acquiring more collectables. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Achievement system.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Settings are on the wall of TRU. Back pack is glitched but works. Just grab the empty circles to take the stuff out. Please visit my patreon to support this project! It's the only way I can continue this massive project.</p>\n\r\n\r\n&lt;script async=\"\" src=\"https://c6.patreon.com/becomePatronButton.bundle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T09:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabe8fa8e75862c5f12f881cf4e7e00d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["timemachinevr"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
