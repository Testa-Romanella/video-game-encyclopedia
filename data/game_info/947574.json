Every time you kill an enemy you change your \"bulb\" and your attack type to that of the enemy. Your goal is to beat 10 combat levels, every third level is a utility room where you can heal and get a power up. To go up a level you need to enter the door at the top of the room. In the top right corner you can see how much energy you have left. If your energy goes below zero you will lose a life. Your energy is reset to five when you kill an enemy.
