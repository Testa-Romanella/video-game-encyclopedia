This character was made with the intention of representing\u00a0the sin of wrath. I have made the sprite a neutral one so that at some point in the future i can use this as a base of how i should make other emotions for the character.</p>\n<p>Sticking with this neutral look i have made the facial expression a neutral one. I have however tired to make him still seem aggressive as i believe that a character representing wrath should look threatening almost all the time. This is the reason why the eyes are red and the eyebrows are still at an angle. The scruffy hair came from the idea that the character comes from a poorer background where looking tough meant more than looking good.</p>\n<p>The character has a tattoo on his right arm as tattoos are often associated with violence. This also ties into why the sleeve is torn, it allows for more of the tattoo to be on display while making him look violent for just having it torn in that way. The choice of having no injury underneath also has purpose, it\u00a0 is meant to show that this tare was not a recent one. This is to again put emphasis on the character feeling it necessary to look tough instead of good while also showing that he may not be able to just buy new clothes.</p>\n<p>The wide stance the character has is one that is meant to be intimidating as they feel it necessary to always assert their dominance. The style of clothing is a plain casual one as again they don't feel the need to look good.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c40b7616e9ea6ac1d68f47c1e38269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xenoheart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
