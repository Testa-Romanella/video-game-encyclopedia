I was in high school at the time and only had access to the internet through a 56k dial up modem.<br/><br/>I do not have any project files left but i still love the music of this game and its fun to play even today. Thats why i have made it possible to download even as the game is not and never will be finished.<br/></p>\n<p>Including in the game:</p>\n<ul><li>4 finished levels with a boss.</li><li>2 unifinished levels.</li><li>3 Sounds tracks.</li><li>7 power ups (weapon power up is randomly changing weapon type (red - low lvl, yellow - mid level, green - high level))</li><li>2 Player local co-op support</li><li>Save and load progress.</li></ul>\n<p>! The game was created when windows still was shiny user interface on top of DOS.
