At this point, i had not seen alot of gameplay, so it was up to me to create it.</p>\n<p>Because of his continued work on the original game, i will stop the development here.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\r\nAudio:<br/>Juhani Junkala@Subspace_AudioConcept:HacksawUnit@HacksawUnit", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4aba07a915c0f689893e1aa073857655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaffa"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
