Solve puzzles by controlling two characters and guiding the two characters closer together so they can combine and become stronger. When the characters aren't combined, they are weaker (they take more damage and do less damage). However, when the characters are combined they are much much stronger, they have double jump, dash, speed, health etc. Play through 10 levels and receive a 3-star rating for each level depending on how fast you complete the level and if you collect all the coins scattered throughout each level. Avoid deadly traps and dangerous enemies! Use your sword to defend yourself.
