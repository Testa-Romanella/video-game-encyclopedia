We progress Rabiah's family quest, Fairy's side quest will finally branch into three different outcomes, and Ain gets two more scenes. Have fun!<br/></p><p>___________________\r\n</p><p><strong>0.12a Changelog:</strong><strong><br/><br/>New Content: <br/></strong><strong>\n</strong>- Added scenes: \u00a0 <br/>\u00a0- Continuation of Fairy's questline\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0- Continuation of Rabiah/Nadia's questline. <br/>\u00a0- Harem scene (Zahra solo)  <br/>\u00a0- Harem scene (Emilia solo)<br/>\u00a0- Ain/Emilia in Ain's room<br/>\u00a0- Ain in the hallway<br/><br/>\r\n- Added 1 small event: \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 - Repeatable Hive Queen visit \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<strong><br/><br/>Reworks and Revisions:\r\n</strong><br/>- d1e (Zahra's introduction) \u00a0\r\n<strong><br/><br/>Minor changes / Bugfixes:\r\n<br/>\n</strong>- Kyra's basement content should now not block other basement content \r\n<br/>- Fixed a long-standing bug where you couldn't get Fairy from K&amp;K if Ivy was dead \u00a0\r\n<br/>- Turned Ivy back to Igor in the Kateryna visit scene \u00a0\r\n<br/>- Replaced Ivy's music theme in previous scenes\r\n<br/>- Various text corrections and typos\r\n</p><p>Plans for the next update:\r\nAs I've announced before, I will be abroad for several weeks for personal reasons, so I won't be around to post weekly progress logs probably until early March. This will also be my first break from doing these logs in a little more than two years now.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once I'm back, I will start working on 0.13: Shani &amp; the Queen. The next update will focus mostly on them. We will conclude Shani's adventure into the Zone and also get to visit Queen for an update about the current status of the missions (and other...things). I am looking forward to advance the main story to a place where we have more freedom to explore different things without being plot-bound.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Developing this game is a blast, and we're nowhere near done yet. Cycling through the characters each update gives me new motivation after each release, and I'm looking forward to fleshing the game out even more. As always, thank you so much for supporting me and giving me the tools to do so. :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T14:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/6570648fdbd5ee45adeebe4ab4117bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zetan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
