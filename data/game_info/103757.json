In <em>The Endless River</em>, you guide souls through the process of transmission from death to rebirth.</p>\n<p>We also used the diversifiers (extra challenges) Palindrome and That-Kind-a-Game. Palindrome challenged you to make a game in which\u00a0\"the game story must end the same way it began\", and That-Kind-a-Game challenged you to \"create a game that explores how choosing kindness transforms the world\".</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Click on the fairies to mix colors in your lamp (top-left) to match the color of the passenger's soul (top-right).</p>\n<p>When you have successfully matched the colors, the passenger moves on into their next life, and you get a new passenger.
