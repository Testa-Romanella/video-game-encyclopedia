To run, please have Steam VR installed.</p>\n<p>Jam notes:</p>\n<p>The Jam's theme is One Tool, Many Uses. This game takes a gentle interpretation of the theme, placing a focus on the player's ability to interact with their environment in an intuitive and engaging way - you are the tool. The game tests a fast implementation of\u00a0some in-house VR tech, that is in early\u00a0development. Whilst still a work-in-progress, the game's VR Interaction system helps you to believe your environment, as well as being good fun.</p>\n<p>I used my time in this jam to craft a short, but engaging story, and to try and build a complete narrative experience. There is a lot I'd like to add, but I am happy with the outcome of a week's work. If you choose to play this, I\u00a0hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Game instructions:<br/></p>\n<p>1) Try to stand near to the centre of your playspace.</p>\n<p>2) Use your hands to interact with the world around you.</p>\n<p>3) To return to the main menu at any time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:00:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/564d0b70c2209a9286913b18d2fedde1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahume"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
