Take control of a hand-drawn  ship and hop from planet to planet, destroying opponents on the way!  Collect pencil shavings and use them to buy items and upgrades!\r\n </p>\n<p>In the vastness of paper-space, you won't be alone! Steal your enemies' colors and use them to literally draw in your own ships! Each color has a different power, ranging from pyromancy and bounciness to mind control and vampirism.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you're done, enjoy the finer things in life, like obsessing over  the cards you've collected along the way! Every enemy and item has a  chance of dropping a card with poorly written lore or unfunny jokes. <br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and get ready for some bullet dodgin'! You'll need it to survive whats coming your way!</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Sketch\u00a0Fleets:\u00a0Recolored\u00a0was\u00a0built\u00a0using the eldritch energies that inhabit this world (and Unity, but they're pretty much the same thing).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bozzi \ud83d\ude0e - Character, Environment Artist and Game Designer</strong></p>\n<strong>\n<p>Jubs \ud83e\udd8a\u00a0 - Environment, VFX, UI Artist</p>\n<p>Renzo Diniz \ud83d\udc38 - Production Assistant, UX Designer, QA Manager</p>\n<p>Paulo Oliveira \ud83d\ude35 - AI, Gameplay, Back-End Programmer and Project Manager</p>\n<p>S\u00e9rgio Macellani \ud83d\udd2e - Gameplay Programmer, Sound Designer</p>\n<p>\u00c1rnilsen Arthur \ud83e\udd2c - Back-End Programmer</p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc9e8a903ceb2bbad47e499b07dd8bd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Buff Buff"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
