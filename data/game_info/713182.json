In the game, you're placed in the world imagined through the album of Nurture. Draw on the sky and take a look around the world I created :)</p>\n<p>When I was creating this game, I was thinking about what a game interpreted\u00a0based on music would look like. The prototype went through many iterations, from starting just as a long cutscene to a rhythm game, and now this. Although this is just a proof of concept, I hope to expand on this idea more in the future.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Mouse - look around</p>\n<p>Left Click - draw</p>\n<p>Created by: Brian Kim</p>\n<p>Music: Wind Tempos (piano cover) by Keudae</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T08:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893d70a819305bee083f6fbe582ddd74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brian Kim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
