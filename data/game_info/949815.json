If I had more time, I would have expanded upon the game much more. Let me know if you think I should do this, as I actually really enjoyed making this game and think that it could be much better (eg: levels, player health mechanic, better enemies, improved UI, ammo, bosses, etc).</p>\n\n<p>If you played GHOSTKILLER, thanks a lot! Hope ya enjoyed this really basic version/prototype of a project I am actually keen on working on :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba39a2db3b053b304737213d664f923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thisGameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
