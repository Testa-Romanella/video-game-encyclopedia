You are a snake, which is travelling through a very long tunnel. During your travels you encounter fruit and bombs, which are placed at random inside the tunnel. The snake can eat the fruit if the fruit reaches its head for points. However, the bombs must be avoided. If any part of the snake collides into a bomb (or vice-versa), the bomb will explode along with the snake. The game will then be over.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Completing a level<br/><br/></strong>Between the score panel and below it is a timer bar. This will drain per interval. This indicates how far or near you are to the next level. After the bar runs out fully, you will move onto the next level, which will get faster. For each level completed, a bonus of 1,000 points will be awarded.</p>\n<p>There are 8 levels in total - if you can survive for that long that is!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/><br/></strong>Use Joystick in port 2 only (If playing online, use Cursor Keys as direction and Z as the firebutton).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Programming, charset, sound effects and music by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics, sprites and loading bitmap by\u00a0<strong>Hugues Poisseroux</strong><br/>Tape loader source by\u00a0<strong>Martin Piper\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Richard<br/><br/></strong><strong>Glossary:<br/><br/></strong>The following C64 tools were used in developing this game production</p>\n<ul><li>Multipaint by Dr. Terrorz</li><li>Spritepad V2.0Beta by Subchrist</li><li>Charpad V2.7.6 by Subchrist</li><li>GT Ultra V1.4 by Cadaver and Jason Page</li><li>CBMPRGStudio V4.0 by Arther Jordison</li><li>KickAssembler V5.52 by Slammer/Camelot</li><li>TS Crunch V1.4 by Antonio Savona</li><li>Dir Master by Style</li><li>TapeToolBuild V1.0.0.7 by Martin Piper</li></ul>\n<p>(C)2022 The New Dimension<br/><br/><em>Like with all TND games.
