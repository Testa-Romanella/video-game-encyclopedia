Although I'm pretty rusty, I'm pretty happy with what I have achieved in this jam : ) It's different from what I'm used to making, especially since the theme was the one <strong>I\u00a0DID NOT want to be picked at all, </strong>but hey I learned something new at least!</p>\n\n<p>SIDENOTE: This game was supposed to be bigger than it is :( I had to cut a lot of content because a certain tile bug took up most of my time that I spent 3 days to fix it alksdjsalkj</p>\n\n<p>SIDESIDENOTE: This game was actually <em>inspired </em>by a game I played during my childhood :) It's called <strong>Kombat Fighters</strong> in Newgrounds, and I really liked the concept of having a strategy game in this form!</p>\n<p>Developer: MaplePoki</p>\n<p>Cover Art by : gabdraws_</p>\n\n<p>POSSIBLE BUG (?)</p>\n<p>There's this weird issue I think by the unity player is that if you click the help button in the menu, it would sometimes lag, or crash the game! Try opening the game again and see if it works again!
