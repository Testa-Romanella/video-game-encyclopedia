If you're too far away from him, he'll move to you through the walls (to avoid having Baldi stuck in a corner). Once he reaches you, it's game over!</p>\n\n<p>When enabled, after you've collected a book, It's A Bully will spawn in 1 of 3 places randomly in the current chunk that you're in, for a set amount of time. He wouldn't let anybody (except Gotta Sweep,) pass if they try to go through him!</p>\n\n<p>When enabled, after you've collected a book, Gotta Sweep will spawn in his closet\u00a0on certain chunks. After some time, he'll move around the chunk before coming back to his closet. The camera will shake when he sweeps you up.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Fangame and 8-Bit Soundtracks by: Normal_Person2_0</p>\n<p>Baldi's Basics\u00a0by:\u00a0Mystman12 and/or\u00a0Basically Games</p>\n<p>Baldi's Basics\u00a0Fangame Friday\u00a0Jam 7 hosted by:\u00a0JohnsterSpaceGames</p>\n<p>Elevator MIDI provider: Punkred</p>\n<p>School MIDI provider:\u00a0Punkred</p>\n<p>Party MIDI provider: Saintza4</p>\n<p><strong>Tools\u00a0Used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>GB Studio 3.1.0</li><li>hUGETracker</li><li>OpenMPT</li><li>Tiled</li><li>Pixilart.com</li><li>Hauntology's\u00a0\r\nPlatformer Plus</li><li>Yousurname's and\r\nPautomas's plugin</li><li>JamesPark's tools</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:12:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/367850c00f3ced6ce5c7e99aecc5facb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Normal_Person2_0"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
