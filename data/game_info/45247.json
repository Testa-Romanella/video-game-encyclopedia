You can use those energy cells in workshops scattered all over the colony to upgrade some weapons or your energy generator, so your energy bar reloads faster.<br/>You can also farm for energy cells by revisiting previous areas for as long as you wish.<br/>There is no limit on the upgrade system, so you can end up with incredibly powerful weapons, so no matter how difficult the game gets for you, you can farm and upgrade your weapons to the point where you have no rival.<br/><br/>-Map:<br/><br/>You have a basic map of the colony which shows your location. You can use it to find secret areas in the colony.<br/>-Non linear game style:<br/>You can re-visit any area of the colony and use your new weapons and abilities to access rooms or areas you could not before, so you might find power ups or weapons.<br/>Also, further on the game you can do several objectives in any order you like.<br/><br/>-Explosions:<br/><br/>Who doesn\u2019t like explosions? There are LOTS of explosions!<br/>A big part of the addictive playability is due to the fact that there is a very elaborate combo system with the explosions, chain reactions, friendly fire, etc.<br/>It is really advised for the player to master the explosions dynamics early in the game to make use of them efficiently and improve the game experience.<br/><br/><br/>Welcome back to the past, when you really had fun with videogames.<br/>Welcome to Mars\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/5164c7c5858e50e961a6aeaa4bb28bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Oscar Kenneth Albero Ingles", "Kai Magazine Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oscar Kenneth Albero Ingles"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
