The player may encounter other animals while exploring the forest, they are all friendly of cource. When starting the game the player has the choice between a summer or winter world, two different experiences but each just as calming. A fascinating gameplay feature is the ability to change the time of day, the plaer can simply walk\u00a0 up to the lake and choose any time of day they would like.</p>\n<p>Contribution to Project:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Level Design. I played the role of lead level designer. I took the assets created by the artist and built the summer and tutorial levels. Throughout the level development there were are couple of iterations before the final product.</p>\n<p>Working on this project I learnt many things. I learnt that team projects are fun as you only need to worry about your own section of the game, but you still need to acknowledge the rest of the project to make it all work. I learnt that a team projects works really well with a team that works well together and is on the same page in terms of project planning and design.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/7768f1e3bd0a998141e5c96da572cb88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Fernandes Marcos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
