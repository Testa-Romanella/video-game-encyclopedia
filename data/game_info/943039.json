These zoos offered a special opportunity that was highly sought after by a specific type of villain in the galaxy, the kind that likes to hunt a native species for sport. To make the challenge more difficult they started enhancing the fauna. Eventually, the host species grew bored of killing the species and they left the dome abandoned. They failed to turn off any of the security systems.</p>\n<p>Your kin have lost sentience. The cybernetic chips in their brains leaves them with little more than a baseline intelligence level. The same cybernetic chip that just shorted in your own cybernetic brain.</p>\n<p>Good luck escaping the dome before your consciousness defrags for the last time.</p>\n\n<p>******</p>\n<p>Roguelike Deckbuilder where cards are interwoven with actions.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p>Bump into objects by walking into them to interact</p>\n<p>. , for moving up/down stairs</p>\n<p>g for pickup of items</p>\n<p>i for inventory</p>\n<p>Esc - Close all open menus, cancel card buys, etc.</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel - Zoom in and out</p>\n<p>Click cards to play them</p>\n\n\n<p>Make sure to pet the dogs on your way out!</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was created for the 7drl challenge.
