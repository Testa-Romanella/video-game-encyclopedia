An extraterrestrial creature has landed on earth and it is obsessed with our food. The digestive system of this creature turns matter into pure gold. Your job is to overlook production of its food, feed it and collect it's... excrements. Our scientists are studying this creature and were able to generate a few new unknown to us resources. To help you on your mission, we are assigning you to commander Yukari, our best to oversee this important and top secret mission. Now get to work, soldier!\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOperation Food to Gold is a free to play idle game in early access.<br/>\r\nWhat you can do right now in the game:<br/>\r\n- Invest gold in the production of raw food materials, then cook those into food and feed them to the purple alien blob.<br/>\r\n- The blob will digest the food and in turn give you gold.<br/>\r\n- Once you reach 100k gold, you can \"purpstige\" (reset your progress), so you can then invest into science.<br/>\r\n- Science will produce purple matter, which you can use to buy more upgrades, gifts for your commander or cosmetics, to customize your blob to your liking.<br/>\r\n- Cosmetics are just that. They do not offer any bonuses, so that the player can customize their blob to their liking, not what is most efficient.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome of the garbage in the mystery box might be offensive to you. In that case, sorry. It's meant as humor and nothing else. My sense of humor is also inside the mystery box.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features 2 DLCs. No content is locked behind DLCs. All content can be experienced without having to spend a single dollar. The DLCs are a huge boost to the early game and one could see them as pay to win. If you buy them, then thank you for your support! If not, then it's ok, I hope you are having fun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTrailer music by: Gunnar Olsen - Trancer<br/>\r\nFound on Youtube channel: @RoyaltyFreeMusicGo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T03:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677d95a150f083ea8e1b3003493888a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roxy Constantine"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roxy Constantine"], "esrb_rating": null}
