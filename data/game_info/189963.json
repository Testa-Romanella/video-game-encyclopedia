Scroll your way through endless randomly generated levels by jumping over the pits, shooting the road blocks, flying enemy and bullets. Gather as much score as you can to surpass the highest score. Much like the classic Atari game Moon Patrol!</p>\n<p>Artwork style\u00a0inspired by the artist Roy Lichtenstein. His work was greatly inspired by the classic comic book strip and yet was criticized for copying the classic comic style.
