The main thing is not to forget a daily sustenance!<br/>\r\nBut there won't be any problems with that, right? Yeah \u2013 tell that to the girl who spilled coffee on the food replicator! Of course, there are a lot of eateries around, but you need to remember the rules of decency, and try not to violate some Intergalactic Code of Some Boring Nonsense.<br/>\r\nTo eat at the nearest cafe \u2013 what could be easier, right? Right?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are two endings in the game. It won't be hard to find both.
