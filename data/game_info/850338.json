I added to this idea, it being that unlike other \"Build a thing\" type games this game works on no grid, you have to precisely place in each component and screw it to the board in order for it to work, instead of the components snapping into place like in other games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I created this game because the idea sounded interesting, but I won't continue working on it since I'm busy with\u00a0aLithuanianSummer, a bigger game I'm working on. If you want to see my coding practices, just want to see how this game works or you want to continue it, download the \"RepairGame UNITY PROJECT\" file (uses Unity version 2021.3.6f1). If you're going to create a game using this a base, you don't need to credit me... well unless you really really want to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mouse</strong> to look around</li><li><strong>F</strong> to pick up object</li><li><strong>Mouse Scroll Wheel\u00a0</strong>to bring object up/down</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0<strong>Button 2</strong> +\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong> to rotate holding object</li><li><strong>R\u00a0</strong>to put screws in object</li></ul>\n<p><strong>If the board lights up you did it!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a14aaa9551f5bd9ae7058033847a94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scorpion37"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
