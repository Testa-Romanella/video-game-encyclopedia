From the moment he opens his eyes to see the surreal monochrome cat world he can run, jump, dash, and wall jump. His friendly droid FT follows him around as his flying arsenal of ranged weapons. Once Art has a sword he can hack away at enemies and do some cool combos, hack-stab-hack, hack-kick-hack up, you get the picture. Most of the swords Art finds deal more damage to organic enemies whilst FT's guns do more damage to mechanical enemies making them the perfect duo. In the surreal world of cats there aren't just organic and mechanical enemies, oh no! There are organic enemies wearing mechanical armour, mechanical baddies with organic internals and brains, machines that wear other living beings as armour. This is a strange and deadly world and Art and FT must work together to overcome the plethora of threats facing them.<br/><br/>As well as the hack 'n' shoot lifestyle that Art and FT must adopt they also need to explore the world. Exploration on the isometric world map will uncover new areas, characters to talk to, side quests, and loot. Art can travel to a number of towns where he can help the locals, buy supplies, and do all manner of side activities. Once Art and FT have cleared out the enemies from an area they can explore the area using Art's  moves; jumping holes, climbing cliffs, dashing over spike pits to uncover hidden treasure and quest items.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fa7a8f6cea9ad0ccc188b18b5c43ae1.jpg", "website": "http://flawlessthegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bare Knuckle Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bare Knuckle Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
