Each level contains more or less rain. As a machine, that is highly dangerous to touch so you must take extra care to circumvent it.<br/></p>\n<p>I mean, its really simple, its in the title. <br/></p>\n<p>Just don't touch the rain.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The first bigger project I tried my hands on. It started as a rain mechanic that looked kinda cool, but took a lot, and I mean a ton of ressources.<br/></p>\n<p>I even made a discord for it, found a couple pixel artist, but for technical reasons, the whole thing never really went off. The main mechanic always felt kind of lackluster and weird to play with. I tried to implement it in a couple of ways, but it never clicked.</p>\n<p>So I moved on after 6 Prototypes.</p>\n\r\nI am a single developer and all my games will be free to play over at itchio/steam/etc...\r\nI am currently making games as a hobby. This won't change in the near future, but with enough support via Patreon I can outsource some parts of game-making like art, sound and music. This will not only vastly improve the games, but will make development much faster\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/korbohned\r\nYour support is very appreciated!\r\nKorbohneD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f548988a587c7a9dcfc929a47fb5a685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KorbohneD"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
