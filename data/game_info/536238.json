I decided to put together this small text adventure in Unity and c#. I had a good time building this, specifically, I\u00a0enjoyed all the architecture involved. This was written with modularity in mind so that events, commands, and rooms can be added very easily.\u00a0I\u00a0am not an artist so the fact that there are really no assets to worry about was really great. I hope that people will get maybe a few minutes of enjoyment out of playing it. I added the game here as a browser game however, I also added binaries for Windows, and Linux as well for download.\u00a0Use help to get a list of commands. I might add a hint feature in the future. Just concentrate on the command you need and the name of an object. For example, go building, take lantern, use button, etc. The game can be restarted if you get stuck by typing restart. Other commands are listed by typing help. I\u00a0believe I\u00a0got all the typo's but I\u00a0am happy to fix them if you let me know. I\u00a0did this in about 12 hours. Oh, once the game loads in the browser you might have to click on it before it will read spacebar input. The fact that it is displayed in an iframe keeps it from having focus after it is loaded even though the game is actively focused on the input box.\u00a0This is only supposed to be something that will take 5 minutes or so to play, essentially as a test of the architecture and something fun to mess with. At the end of the day, I\u00a0am left with a pretty easy-to-use text adventure engine.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T06:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01d309b63e0ab1978732ed50f82f5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bondreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
