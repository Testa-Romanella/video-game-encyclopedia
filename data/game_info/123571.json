Ghost Heck is a classic platformer with a twist.  There is an evil eye in slumber that occasionally wakes and looks for moving ghosts.  When the eye opens, you must be sure to not move or you will surely perish in ghost heck.  It's important to track enemy movements to anticipate not being in their path when the eye is open.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/5175e5737579dfcbe337ec370242c71c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cristianohh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
