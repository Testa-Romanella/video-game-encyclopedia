The fighters compete against each other to become \n      the world\u2019s toughest combatant, with players using a setup consisting of \n      only three buttons (one each for punching, kicking, and throwing). \n      Adding to this unique system is the fact that the strength of your \n      offensive blow depends on how long the button is pressed and held. Along \n      with regular match styles, Death Match mode is also available and \n      features mines, electrified ropes, and other dangerous objects in the \n      battle arena that can change conditions during the fight or damage \n      players. Enjoy the wide range of combat forms as you take on history\u2019s \n      best!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
