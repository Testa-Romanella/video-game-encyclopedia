The ball will bounce off the ground, but will destroy the ground block while doing so. If the ball falls below the ground, you lose a life. See if you can get enough points to make the high score leaderboard - a true staple of the arcade! Obtain a mushroom to double the size of your paddle. Hit enemies to score bonus points.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mario-style blocks from Cube World - Proto Series\u00a0 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/cube-world-proto-series-14..</p>\n<p>Enemies from KUBIKOS - Cube Monsters\u00a0 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/kubikos-cube-monst...</p>\n<p>Mario-style font obtained from\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/super-mario-bros.font</p>\n<p><strong>VERSION LOG</strong><br/></p>\n<p>v1.0 - Initial build</p>\n<p>v1.1 - Added enemies and power-ups</p>\n<p>v1.11 - Minor bug fixes to prevent high score popup, power-up paddle location issue,\u00a0and never-ending enemies getting trapped on the level. (Will upload after voting ends.)</p><p><strong>KNOWN BUG LIST</strong><br/></p><p>- The high score notification pops up before the game ends</p><p>- The paddle, when powered-up size, clips behind the pyramids</p><p>- Enemies just keep spawning even if they get trapped by the level design after the player's actions. The player can either \"collect\" them or they will get removed upon player losing the ball</p><p>- Occasionally the ball will get stuck in an endless back and forth pattern. At the moment, there is no bug fix designed for that situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fe2f14729ff3d1746890eb0ce1e7d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Weenie Walker Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
