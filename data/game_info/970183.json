I made a little Platformer game in which I implemented some of my ideas. Fair to say that I'm not a professional in game design and I work alone so I couldn't make everything I wanted. Nevertheless, you're gonna have:<br/><br/><ul><li> Comfortable controls &amp; Impact<br/></li><li> Diversity of movement mechanics<br/></li><li> A lot of cool levels<br/></li><li> Enjoyable minimalistic visual style<br/></li><li> Total absence of the fourth wall<br/></li><li> Funny story line</li></ul><br/>Also about the story line! The idea is that various bloggers invaded the game and for different spoiled a nice and simple adventure by adding tons of deadly traps! <br/><br/>By the way, one of the main characters is me! If you try my little experiment I will be grateful! See you in the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T03:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff7e7b31c3a24b5e23b9060fa484540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vadd games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Conglomerate 5"], "esrb_rating": null}
