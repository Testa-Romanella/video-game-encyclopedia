While you get to read about a story of a young woman finding themselves in an unusual place, it also features the lives and developments of three other students: the blue skinned\u00a0Azura Bell, the four armed\u00a0Seiko Watanabe, and the oddly normal\u00a0Yasuda Nana. During the story, you will occasionally get \u201cFree Time\u201d, which allows you to roam around the school and get to know the environment of the supernatural world. Ultimately, the decisions that you make in the game matter, as the way you play will change your ending in various ways.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you soon.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23ad641f28f6a253ba995f9a58d9c9b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["P.
