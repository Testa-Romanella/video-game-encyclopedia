The player assumes the role of a Phoenix that flies through the sky. The game was influenced by Flappy Bird.</p>\n<p>The player's goal is to score as many points as possible by navigating through hoop objects. However, if they touch the hoop, the player loses stamina. Stamina is required to keep the player alive and flying. If the player reaches 0 stamina they fall to their death. The player instantly loses all their stamina if they touch the clouds (roof) or trees (ground). The player can regain stamina by successfully traversing through the hoops.</p>\n<p>Overtime, the Phoenix grows in size making it hard to fit between the hoops. The player can 'Rebirth' which shrinks the Phoenix back to it's original in exchange for some its stamina.</p>\n<p>The game keeps track of the player's high score.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Spacebar - Flap Wings / Ascend<br/>X - Rebirth</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4aeb545376ccf87c4bfe8c5fc622117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dhevan Lau"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
