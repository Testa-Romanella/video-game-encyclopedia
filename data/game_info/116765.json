A world in which a corporation changes the rules, the media cover up the truth, and you are part of the machinery that fuels wars for its own advantage.</p><p>You are one of many, going to work everyday, stuck in the rails that keep you and your peers on track. The maxim of living here: Don't deviate, don't ask, don't look for reasoning. And you stick to it. Until the first deviant contacts you and starts opening your eyes.</p><p><strong>Team Members:</strong></p><p>Allen Ohan D\u00fclgar - Game Design &amp; Programming <br/>Barbara Sedderz - 2D Arts &amp; Narrator Voice<br/>Lena Werthmann - 3D Arts<br/>Remus Constantin - Game Design &amp; Sounds<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/76533f5b5caab6a28e9b5d1b4ea3575e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Remus", "monkeyotoshi", "Allen Ohan D\u00fclgar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
