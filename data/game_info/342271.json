So for my first act as a new dev I welcome you all to play my first short test of a game, Bugs. Its a straightforward Galaga style space shooter with unique ships and abilities.</p>\n<p>As this is just my first experiment working in Gamemaker it's missing a lot of polish. It's not intended to really be a final product, more of a test. I am not currently intending on continuing work on this project however I may revisit the concept in the future. I do however have a prototype of an idea on my mind that I can hopefully share something of soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c556da8557fa5e517eb1f5a72896cb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hansy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
