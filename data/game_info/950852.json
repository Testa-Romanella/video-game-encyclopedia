Will put that in the game as well.</p>\n<p>Make sure to save often, and in different slots! Otherwise you can get softlocked, as the game can be quite tough and you can't escape encounters!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy the game, morbesties!!!</strong></p>\n<p>NOTES: BUGS EXIST</p>\n<p>Party add flags have no self switches - minor bug</p>\n<p>\u00a0The player can sequence break the game just by going up because the path isn't blocked off by any switch!!! Go RIGHT after getting Martine.</p>\n<p>Martine Do NOT go up before getting the Trap Smasher! GO EAST!</p>\n<p>IT'LL BE FIXED TIMELY! I just need a lil bit of a break, worked for pretty much\u00a020 hours straight\u00a0 on this stuff\u00a0yesterday to meet the birthday deadline.</p><p>FIXED</p>\n<p>Balance patches will happen, also.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533920cad7ccf724a7ccacf5c424de88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cathulhu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
