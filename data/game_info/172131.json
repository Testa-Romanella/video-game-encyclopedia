It's made out of pieces of various images, from  classic paintings to shit found on the Internet. I'm no game designer, and I'm not pretending it's a good game : it's totally stupid, has poor animation and gameplay, you might get stuck for no reason, and there's not even a real goal. So no need for any hating or trolling : if you don't like it or just don't get it, don't play ! </p><p>And if you'd like to know more about what i do :</p><p>http://stab-art.com/<br/></p><p>https://www.behance.net/stab<br/></p><p>https://www.facebook.com/Stabeor/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b57787b8819c65fd11795ebff99d2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stabeor"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
