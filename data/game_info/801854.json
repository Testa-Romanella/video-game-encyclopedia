Or at least try to get a good one.</p>\n<p>Final project for CDM 175!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Remember--after the intro screen, use arrow keys to advance!</p>\n<p>SPACE to advance when prompted and to select flowers, LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to navigate through narration and dialogue, 1/2/3 to view flowers, Q to quit in app, ESC to quit in browser.</p>\n<p>HUGE thanks to babyjeff for drawing the flowers and to Isuph for helping with the code, I couldn't have finished this without either of you.
