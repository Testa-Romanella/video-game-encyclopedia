All revenue is going directly into funding the hardware of this studio so we can expand our scope into some truly amazing games. Until then, here's a small nugget of our passion towards gaming that is by no means perfect, but is made with every ounce of effort and love that we have.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/67326c26f58655f42c56b7439e041add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnderdogTagTeam"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
