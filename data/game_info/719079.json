This game will be updated whenever I get around to finishing up adding new things, and as such will likely be sporadic in its updates.</p>\n<p>THE GAME:</p>\n<p>The game is currently in a state I'd like to refer to as \"Grueling Demo State,\" where there is really only one thing that could currently be done. The story is you work in a mining camp in a world called the Psychescape, and they won't let you back out unless you make enough money to buy a permit. So really all you can do is mine and pay them off, and then the game stops there, but the game is intended to be something of an open-world rpg.\u00a0I'm already working on adding more places for the next update, so stay tuned if you like the style, and give me suggestions if you want.</p>\n<p>I have multiple things that I am either considering or going to add, and I would love to hear back from anyone who has an opinion on the game, such as\u00a0\u00a0what they think and what might make it better.</p>\n<p>THINGS I PLAN TO ADD:</p>\n<p>\u00a0* A much better save system, where you may simply copy and paste a single string.</p>\n<p>* More places to go and things to do, such as hunting, combat, NPC interactions, and other varying things to do that would make the game more interesting.</p>\n<p>THINGS I MAY ADD:</p>\n<p>* If I can figure it out and advance in my programming\u00a0 as well as\u00a0either find a good artist or become a good artist, I would love to make a version of the game that is more along the lines of a visual novel.</p>\n<p>* If I can figure out how to make my python code into an executable, I would love to add those for downloads.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where I can be reached:</p>\n<p>scribe2thefiends@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T07:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c5554f7409de9ab9c46c5bcb08dafd6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amaranthus Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
