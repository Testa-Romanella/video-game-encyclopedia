For each drop(which leaves a blue mark) you collect you get 25 points, and the flower will stop shrinking. If you manage to get a drop of water in the center(which will leave a yellow mark) you\u00a0 get\u00a0 100 points and the flower will grow!\u00a0Currently the only losing condition of the game is if you let a drop slip by 3 times;\u00a0 I was trying my best\u00a0to make it so that when there aren't any drops in the flower and if you click/press space you also lose a life,\u00a0 but due to lack of time (and knowledge) I wasn't able to implement it perfectly, so you can spam if you want :D (It's a FEATURE, NOT a BUG, Okay?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/306968a90dad69fdb1ae47bd8f07aceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ProSmashy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
