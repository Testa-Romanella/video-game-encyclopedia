Some of them are pretty fast and hard to kill so we have prepared a small arsenal to help you get rid of them faster.\u00a0 For your effort of destroying the pesky cells, you will receive a handsome award in diamonds that you can later use to upgrade your arsenal of bombs, walls, and cannons.</p>\n<p>The different types of cancer cells attacking will\u00a0make you adapt your strategy constantly to keep up the defence. There are several levels of difficulty that will challenge your speed and every time you play.</p>\n<p>Build your walls, place your cannons and rain fury on these pesky little bastards.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0we are slowly getting \"Beat Cancer\" ready for its release we are looking for testers to try out the beta version of our game. We are looking for feedback on what the cells are saying, but also about the games balance and what parts can be improved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:38:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab50313674c6f05ebdad8ca6d60cbeff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["polyspice"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
