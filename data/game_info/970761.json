{"id": 970761, "slug": "onejump-2", "name": "OneJump", "name_original": "OneJump", "description": "OneJump is a minimalistic highscore based jump game. The challenging factor: you only have one chance to jump.<br/><br/>If you fall or get hit by an evil block, you will have to start again. It also gets increasingly harder as you progress.<br/><br/>You can also play against a friend in splitscreen to find out who of you has better skills. Play either 1, 2 or 5 minutes and choose if you want to win based on the score or the level you reach. In the local multiplayer a mistake will result in your score getting halved.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Endless Mode<br/></li><li>Tutorial<br/></li><li>Steam Leaderboard<br/></li><li>Local Multiplayer (for two players)<br/></li><li>Steam Achievements<br/></li><li>Steam Cloud Save</li></ul><br/>Please note that, although the game is DRM-free, the Steam-Features are not available if the game is started from outside of Steam for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>This game is my first publication on Steam. After the completion of this game, I aim to build a more complex project. I really hope you enjoy this little game. Please report any bugs you may encounter so that I can fix them. There shouldn't be many, but as I mentioned, it's really my first game on Steam. Any feedback appreciated.<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T20:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee92a3c5cfbde61e1e4a6a48de23701.jpg", "website": "https://stubenvogel.com/games/#onejump", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felix T.
