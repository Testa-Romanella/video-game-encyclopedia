Well even if not, now is your chance! Get into Wurst Defender Coop Edition and improve your typing skills by writing different words from numerous categories. Download more from our community pages and even create your own and share them with the world to enjoy. <br/>The more words you type, the harder they become, but no worries, you can slow down the game by choosing a lower difficulty. Ease yourself into the game with a partner, who has a much easier job of nursing a plant. With a watering can and some fertilizer crumbs, the life of the writer gets either easier or harder, depending on the mood of your fellow player nursing the plant.
