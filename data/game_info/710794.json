(Louis Schmidberger)", "description": "<p>Solve It! is a multiplayer (3-6 players) puzzle / role play game which is played with digital pen and paper. Players have to solve situations like a crime or prevent it from happening. Players can group up in a lobby and choose a scenario to play. In every scenario there are different roles, one for each player. Every player gets his own information when starting and has to share them with his teammates. But the communication between the players is limited to some short times, they only can communicate with the ingame voice chat when allowed. Also there is an editor for the scenarios in the game, so every player can create scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming:</p>\n<p>Louis Schmidberger\u00a0LinkedIn</p>\n<p>Denise Osterloh</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>Tim Gerber\u00a0LinkedIn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b9/0b9829a13d0d624dacf7f88940b56185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Louis Schmidberger"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
