Taking hits from enemies will shorten your sword. If your sword gets too short, you die, the level is reset, and you are teleported back to the start. Reach the end of the castle level to win!\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to take this Ludum Dare weekend to experiment more with animation and AI in Unity. I also went a bit overboard with extra visual bits. Unfortunately, this means no audio.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am very proud of this entry in particular, since it demonstrates how adding a bit of animation can improve the feel of a game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/304db14abfd996dcd341c2738f0db0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
