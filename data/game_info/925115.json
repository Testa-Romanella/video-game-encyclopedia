Everything before the 1.0 will be free. In other terms the last version before the 1.0 will be left for free but discontinued.<br/>\u263c You may see incomplete classes : they are kept for later. You may have fun with the 4 existing ones !<br/>\u263c Some sounds are still \"borrowed\" from other games, they are placeholders so don't ninja me with lawyers yet ; I will replace them soon enough and well before any penny comes to my pocket from Hand2Hand.<br/><br/>Here bellow are the current milestones.
