In the third part of the game you will have to do the levels as the girl of those times when people tried to survive not to live. As usual, the most important aim of yours is collecting definite things from regular work those times.<br/>\r\nOn every level there are four things. After collecting them the door of the main character will open and, when you open it, you will be on the next level. This part of the game is rich in enemies and traps. They are more and dangerous. Think of your every step and action because one wrong movement and your hero will die. Just face your fear, don\u2019t distract yourself. This game won\u2019t be boring indeed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab050cbceb498456b58fb958504e573e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LTrust"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LTrust"], "esrb_rating": null}
