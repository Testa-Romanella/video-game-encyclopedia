I recreated this in Virtual Reality, combined with a pair Leap Motion hands which you can wave around and form weird abstract shapes.<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO USE: First get some good music playing. Really, this is no fun without music. I recommend DEEP FOREST, ENIGMA and DOOP! After this crucial step, start the program, strap on your HMD and have fun!</p>\n<p>(For keyboard shortcuts and suchlike, check the included readme.txt)</p>\n<p>BTW, this stuff requires VR and Leap Motion. I have only tested it with Oculus Rift CV1, but I *think* it should work with the VIVE too!</p>\n<p>This thing was coded in App Game Kit, Tier 1.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b5cb8e7bc646ae3b670381cb339b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kasper Hviid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
