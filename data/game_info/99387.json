Is in this despair where a small town exists, sheltered from radiation and demons inside a profound cave. <br/>Long thought as uninhabited, an evil appears at the cave, causing terror and despair. <br/> <br/>A long forgotten hero, Khar, appears and confronts the evil. Battle unfolds, but it's too much of a challenge to the old hero. With the help of his daughter Mao and his son-in-law, Oscar, they drive the evil away. But Khar finds himself under a curse caused by the evil. So, to lift its curse, he must seek the evil again, and vanquish it once and for all. <br/> <br/>Khar, Mao and Oscar then set foot to the inner places of the cave. <br/> <br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong> <br/>Taking a regular RPG as a base, there is not THAT much difference at the overall systems. Though here is a list of special features systems have (specially battle). <br/></p><ul><li> Skills can cost Gold, Life or Resistance (a.k.a. MP).</li><li> If your resistance is high, damage gets reduced by a lot and acts as a sponge (some of the damage gets deducted from resistance instead). Less resistance means more damage. </li><li> No levels. Instead, there is A LOT of power-up items. </li><li> Puzzles all around the place, just to mock you. Nana nana! </li><li> Lastly, encounters on map. Some maps don't even have any enemy (and actually there are some unused enemies because of bad planning \"OTL).</li></ul> <br/> <br/><strong>TIPS</strong> <ul><li> Steal as much as possible!</li><li> Uhh... have fun?</li></ul> <br/> <br/><strong>SOME EXTRA INFO</strong> <ul><li> Graphics and scripting all by meself (except one small bit of code I took from a collaboration script I did with some friends, namely Wecoc and Pokepik, and Gerkt).</li><li>Sounds from FreeSound.org, other sounds and some music are from FreeSFX.co.uk, while some pieces of music are property of Kevin MacLeod, under Non-Comercial use (incompetech.com).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d8162dfc2babb7b67136d70a17709a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["muramasa"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
