Just select a highscore and prove that you can do it better. Or learn from them.\n</code></pre>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T09:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/529/529a6c56906973d00138381b70df1ecf.jpg", "website": "https://www.spasstaxi.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScaniX"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ScaniX"], "esrb_rating": null}
