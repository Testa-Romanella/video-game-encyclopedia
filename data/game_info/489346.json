On the annihilation of all enemies the doors will open and if you're lucky you may even receive a healing potion. This potion will fully replenish you ready to face more enemies on the path ahead!

There are 4 stats: health, defence, attack,\u00a0 and speed. Consider each of these as you form your strategy. You will have 6 seconds to make your attacks before your opponent takes a turn, so plan ahead and your life will last far longer. Should your battles be triumphant, you may find a limb to replace one of your own. Now I\u2019m sure you think your limbs are perfectly fine as they are, but hey, maybe you\u2019ll find something you prefer along the way...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T02:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f29ada9efaabaa5b23016b725dfa87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElfQueen", "tatltuae", "Crazychocolate", "Louie_JS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
