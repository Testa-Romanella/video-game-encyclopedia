Furthermore, the same applies to the limited time to drop off passengers. I chose this design because of the no RNG limitation in the game jam.</p>\n<p>Don't mind the game art, I am not particularly skilled at making art. <br/></p>\n<p>Made in Unity. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/082/08244f2f69de635edf3dde8e00a3c14b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["namesnotsteve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
