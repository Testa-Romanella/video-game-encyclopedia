Coming of age means coming one step closer to his spot on the throne, but that is the least of his problems. Now that he is about to enter adulthood, his father and mother both push for him to marry Princess Lucetta of Rosaria, a person who he only sees as a friend from another country. As nice a girl she is, his interests lie elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>If only he were engaged to someone else, like her brother perhaps...</strong></p>\n<p>(This game is a prequel Mark of Lost Royalty, a game I\u00a0made last year.

A bit timid and soft-spoken, he tends to worry about things that most people would not.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Lucetta: </strong>Vestr's fiancee and the Princess of Rosaria.
