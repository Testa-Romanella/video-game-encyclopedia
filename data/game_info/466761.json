{"id": 466761, "slug": "mission-uncontrollable", "name": "Mission Uncontrollable", "name_original": "Mission Uncontrollable", "description": "<p>The evil dictators of a world called CONTROL have trapped you and a buddy in the dungeon!<br/></p>\n<p>They try to spy on you with cameras, keep you under control with locked doors, and surveil you with monsters (with amazing eyesight). <br/></p>\n<p>Even worse, you still need to find the controls for both characters! And if one of the two is even a second without any controls ... they will go OUT OF CONTROL. (Which, to put it mildly, is not a very stealthy maneouver.)<br/></p>\n<p>Can you take the control(s)?</p>\n<p>Can you escape?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You literally need to find the controls as you play. All other gameplay mechanics are explained with a neat in-game tutorial. Here is the very short overview:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>When a character grabs a key, it appears above its head. You can now press that key on your keyboard to make it do something. (An icon underneath shows its effect.)</li><li>To <em>switch</em> a key between characters, press CTRL + &lt;key&gt;</li></ul>\n<p>That's it. You always start with one key (to move left/right).</p>\n<p>You can always <em>give up</em> by pressing ESC. (Which also allows you to restart.)</p>\n<p>Some monsters only raise the alarm, some will attack you and take your keys/controls. Your controls are, sort of, your health.<br/></p>\r\nQuestions\r\n<p><strong>How do I win? </strong>Reach the portal at the bottom of the dungeon! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How do I lose? </strong>If you're spotted by a camera, or make a lot of noise (such as with explosions), the alarm will be raised. If the alarm reaches 100%, you lose.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if both players are without controls (there are monsters that can steal them, for example), you lose.</p>\n<p><strong>How many players?</strong> 1 or 2 players. (But, if you really want, any number of people can crowd behind a keyboard and press some specific buttons.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How big are levels? </strong>Dungeons are randomly generated (from a set of pre-made rooms), always going down. You can set the difficulty (which indirectly sets the level size) at the main screen.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Can I remove the tutorial?</strong> Yup, also an option at the main screen. But the tutorial is literally a single room at the start of the dungeon, I highly recommend keeping it.</p>\n<p><strong>Hey, that music sounds like Mission Impossible? </strong>Let's say I was <em>heavily inspired</em> by the soundtrack when I made my composition.</p>\r\nJam\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020, which had the theme \"Out Of Control\".<br/></p>\n<p>When joining, I forgot my little sister had her birthday on Saturday, so I could only work on the game Friday night and Sunday.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm actually very proud and happy about the results! It's amazing how many hours are in a day (when you forget sleep for a moment).<br/></p>\n<p>These are some things I would like to add in the future (and would have added if I had more time):</p>\n<ul><li>More animations (for monsters and stuff).</li><li>Many more rooms, with more varied tiles and new monsters/surveillance stuff/ways to raise the alarm.</li><li>More feedback for actions, mostly particle effects and stuff. (Always a good thing.)</li><li>Gold + monsters drop gold (or keys/controls) + shop</li><li>As you go deeper into the dungeon, environments change and you encounter new types of tiles and enemies and challenges.</li><li>More actions (such as hacking nearby cameras, becoming invisible, or conversely, making a lot of noise if you have a certain control in your backpack.)</li><li>More sound effects + a better mix/master of the background music.</li><li>Probably forgetting some stuff, never done a game jam in 48 hours before.</li></ul>\n<p>I mean, I <em>really</em> wanted to make a shop where one of the items you can buy is always the \"control\" key. And whenever you want to buy it, it just says \"Sorry, we're out of CONTROL.\" I almost threw away my whole Sunday just so I could make this joke.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you have fun and enjoy the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:56:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f216d62167d1759d34f3bc546dba1c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
