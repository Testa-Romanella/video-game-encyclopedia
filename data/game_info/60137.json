If you have any feedback about the game whatsoever, then please don't hesitate to post a message on the Steam forums. I hope you'll enjoy playing the game, as it has been a labor of love(and lots of frustration).

As you earn money, you can buy better guns. Some levels allow you to roam around and collect supply crates that are traded in for cash, while other levels will have you perched up in a high position and allow you to shoot at zombies without worrying about them hitting you back. Once you call for extraction, you will need to survive for 60 seconds until the helicopter can arrive. If you die, you will lose any money earned in the mission!<br/><br/>Currently, there are six maps to play through with each differing in difficulty.Online PC/VR Cross Play Info<br/>In order to play online together, below are the requirements for each player.<br/><br/>The non-VR player would need the following:<br/>Containment Initiative: PC Standalone(The product page you are currently on)<br/><br/>The VR player would need the following:<br/>Containment Initiative($9.99)<br/><br/>The VR player would select Online Co-op in the main menu and then proceed to host a game.
