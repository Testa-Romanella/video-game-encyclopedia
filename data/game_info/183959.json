Building this game was super fun. Lots of time and energy went into this. I hope you enjoy! I am a drummer and so I loaded 3 songs from my band Infinity at the time now we are called Clairvoyant Rebellion. This is the third time I've done a game jam. The first time I've done it alone. I'm taking a Video Game Development and Design course at Toronto Film School. I hope\u00a0to get my diploma by June. Looking for a job in the industry. Wish me luck and e-mail me to talk or if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Chills, Andr\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83c/83c0b62ba783db72cfa6f3c204a5fa28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dremand@hotmail.com"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
