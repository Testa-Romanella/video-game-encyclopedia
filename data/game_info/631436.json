While thinking of what to do after the theme was revealed - the theme being that size does matter - I thought it would be awesome to have a wrecking-ball like ability with a character who could destroy walls when huge. This also allowed me to explore the math behind spiderman-like traversal mechanics which was pretty fun.<br/><br/>Now that I knew the character could transfer between sizes (which is necessary for the progression of the game), I wanted to give the larger player a lot of weight which is expressed in both the sound design and animations. Of course I also knew that to balance the game, I wanted the player to be careful about when they chose to be big. I decided to include an \"energy bar\" of sorts that increases when you swing from things and decreases when you are big.<br/></p><p>---------------------------------<br/></p><p>Me - all the logic and programming, modeled, textured and animated the main character, created the level design, the ui, and all the gameplay<br/>Not me - grass, trees, logs, dirt texture, sounds<br/><br/>I hope you have fun!<br/><br/>-----------------------------------<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move - WASD<br/>Jump - Space<br/>Grapple - Left Mouse<br/>Toggle Size - Right Mouse<br/>Sprint - Shift</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e3e19e829da5e7bd45566b5036d5b15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rekystudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
