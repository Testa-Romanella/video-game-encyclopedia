Be careful though, as your own bullets can be the death of you, but it's all made worth it when you get that rush of success IF you can beat the level.<br/><br/>Hello, Bouncy Shootz is the working title of a game I created in Unreal Engine 4, the concept behind the game is something I came up with a year or 2 ago and until recently didn't have the means to create it. The game its self is a very fast paced top down shooter which will require the player to think carefully before shooting as the players own bullets will continue on throughout the map. The game in its current state is more of a proof of concept, I added in the basic enemy types and mechanics and would love to hear what you have to say about it so far, I would love to get some suggestions and feedback on this as it is the first full project I have undergone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a86be3af18c24143ca12a0c83be3bc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orion"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
