I did the art and the bit of music and sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as the office man Jacques, who roams around a corporate building taking out some drones who are taking over the company. How you do it? Either push things into them or push em' down!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Your way to defeat an enemy is by pushing a block into them to squish them. Either that or if there's a pit, push them there! His jumping is tricky, because he lacks momentum. So watch where you'll land!\u00a0 There are 20 levels, plus a bonus. at the end. After that last one, you'll go straight bat at the beginning and take on the building again! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools &amp; Programs Used:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>-Engine: Game Maker Studio 1.4</p>\n<p>-Music: DefleMask</p>\n<p>-Sounds: Bfxr</p><p>NOTE: <em>Can't see in a small window?
