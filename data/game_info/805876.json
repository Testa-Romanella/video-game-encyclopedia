The coworkers spots him on his journey but Bob doesn't have the energy to hear the babbling so he brings his laser pointer with him to make them go away!</p>\n<p>The goal is to find the power sockets on each level until all are connected,\u00a0\u00a0but there is only one or two ways to reach it. If you get stuck you have to go back and find another way. You point and shoot with the mouse, and walk with wasd.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy! I had a blast starting to learn game development and thank you Lost Relic Games for hosting this Game Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca8fd4bc08bedc01c145dbef648dc4e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wic St"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
