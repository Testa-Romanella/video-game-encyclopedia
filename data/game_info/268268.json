All the models, art, and music were made by me during the 3-day game jam period.</em><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Though this was originally made for a game Jam (my first game jam woo!), I'm considering fleshing this out, adding more interactivity with the town, and maybe (maybe?) publishing it for real. If you'd like to see that happen PLEASE let me now because i am a distractable and fragile thing and i could use the encouragement. </p>\n<p>This also isn't my only project, so if you're interested in this,\u00a0 or anything else indie gamedev-ish, follow me on Twitter. I'd super duper extremely appreciate it &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1dbf19f8f1c921726d3d690bc8fffc6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["swanijam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
