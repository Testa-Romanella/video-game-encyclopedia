No flashy over the top effects, just good old fashioned fisticuffs!<br/><br/>This is a indie passion project that was made soon after I finished working on Shaolin Vs Wutang.  It is not my intention to provide the same experience as big budget fighting games. But rather I hope to provide players with a satisfying gaming experience blended with nostalgic old school fun. It is being released in early access so i can get valuable support and feedback in order to help the game reach its full potential.<br/><br/>With the help of the community we can create the best game possible!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Current Features Include</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Hand to hand combat<br/></li><li>14 Characters <br/></li><li>Multiple outfits and accessories per character<br/></li><li>14 Stages <br/></li><li>Unique moves and combos for every fighter<br/></li><li>Arcade, Versus, Tournament, Survival, Team battle and Training modes<br/></li><li>Single Player &amp; Local Co-op</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/872f8a555fa1d7d85d85f517f2844738.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jae Lee"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jae Lee"], "esrb_rating": null}
