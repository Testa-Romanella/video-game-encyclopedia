This is a turn-based Puzzle Roguelike game, so you can play at whatever speed you're most comfortable with. As you descend to each floor in the dungeon you will encounter harder and harder monsters to fight. Along the way you'll find shops where you can save your progress and upgrade your character, bosses which you'll need to defeat, and a whole lotta procedurally-generated levels to beat. Can you make it to the 21st floor?<br/><br/>The game features tutorial rooms to introduce you to gameplay, a campaign with three difficulty settings, and interesting challenge levels to beat. When you die - and certainly you will - the next incarnation of the dungeon will be different than the last time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7ddcfd3422bf9b8866d9b03444f112ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Hunter"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Thomas Hunter"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
