I wish to put the play in a relaxing 2D world of scenes in my life, together with a variety interaction with different items in the game. On the other hand, the title of the game contains brackets because a day during lockdown and the one before/after lockdown are no differences to me. Towards this end, My (Quarantine) Day is a 2D point-and-click game with cute and attractive pixel artwork and animation focus on what a day like in my life. The game maintains a relaxing and calm tone with featured sound effects and mild background music.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it:)</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>By using mouse clicks only</p>\n\n<p><strong>BGM &amp; Sound Effect (all from Freesound):</strong></p>\n<p>Analog Alarm Clock - bone666138</p>\n<p>Alone -ShadyDave</p>\n<p>UI Click - eminyildirim</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:31:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e3251a53ffdfb7bf65a04c79a8589aac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YufeiM"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
