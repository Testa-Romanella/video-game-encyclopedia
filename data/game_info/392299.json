It is going to be structured in way that you can easily skip a part and come back to it later.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPart 1 takes you to a virtual tour of the Boeing Renton Factory where the Boeing 737 MAX airliners are built.<br/>\r\nPart 2 takes you to a virtual engine test room and explains how modern aircraft engines work.<br/>\r\nPart 3 takes you to a virtual Wind Tunnel room and explains the role of the winglets on the aircraft.<br/>\r\nPart 4 will show you how the engines are attached to the airframe and how they modified the flight characteristics of the airplane.<br/>\r\nPart 5 will introduce the MCAS system in more details and explain how it was supposed to make the plane easier to fly.<br/>\r\nPart 6 and Part 7 will attempt to recreate flights Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.<br/>\r\nPart 8 will take us back to the drawing board where we will study different proposals on how to improve the MCAS.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad1cf365dbb6d5610167cc0f7cffa8d.jpg", "website": "https://www.newsassim.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kayo Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kayo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
