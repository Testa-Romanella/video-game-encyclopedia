Instead you support your party through magical cards used to buff your party members who act of their own volition in combat as you journey in search of the Wish card of old legends. Build your deck and customize the effects of the cards outside of combat to craft the perfect deck, with hundreds of possible combinations!</p>\n<p>In addition, immerse yourself into the world of InCant and play with real physical cards that are mapped to your in-game cards as you draw from the real deck to play during combat!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Esc - Pause game</li><li>WASD - Directional movement</li><li>QE - Rotate Camera</li><li>Tab - Open / Close Party View</li></ul>\n\r\nTeam Tenebrous is:\r\nAyodele Afolabi\u00a0- UI / FX / 2D Artist\r\nRichard Chen\u00a0- Character / Environmental Artist\r\nKeegan Dant\u00a0- Overworld Programmer\r\nTyler Gentry\u00a0- Card Customization / Systems Programmer\r\nJay Idema\u00a0- Computer Vision Programmer / Auxiliary Game Programmer\r\nJimmy Jin\u00a0- Narrative / Music &amp; SFX Designer\r\nDillon Nagele\u00a0- UI Programmer / Overworld Designer\r\nLeith Reardon\u00a0- Combat Programmer / Project Manager\r\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:36:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29f/29fa22db64476699237723131f6b4810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tygentry"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
