We had to pick a poem from Yoko Ono's book \"Grapefruit\" and create anything we wanted (from the programs we practiced in class), whether it be a game, interactive illustration, etc. </p><p>I chose \"Voice Piece\" and made a small game on Construct 2 about it. The instructions are literally the poem and the character is inspired by the singer \"AURORA\", along with pieces of her voice used as the sound effects! (Even the distorted ones.) I love this singers voice and as I was thinking of ideas for the game, I was listening to her, so that all melded together to make this :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RebecaJ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
