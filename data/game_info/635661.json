Firstly, you start by pressing W. Then you move your spaceship left and right by pressing A or D, and shoot by W. Your goal is to shoot all enemy before they kill you or reach your base.</p>\n<p>Be patient though as I am not experienced at developing under hardware constraint the game does not run particularly efficient, so expect seconds per frame.</p>\n<p>If you are on an emulator it is recommended to speeds thing up.</p>\n<p>If you do multiple commands in a single frame the commands will stack up and execute one by one, this may to due to how input system work in N88-Basic but keep that in mind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378ae3c3d6e3861f7c6181b49c354380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
