Recommended you don't use fast-forward above 4x when your towers are shooting the enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:34:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02a/02aaf4bd73a1b6eb19bc83f1e3820ac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YoYoYonnY"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
