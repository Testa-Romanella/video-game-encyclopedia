For this game that means that things are still in a bit of a sandbox phase, and you may encounter unexpected behavior. All that considered we thought it was a lot of fun.\u00a0Things will be changing (hopefully for the better)\u00a0and occasionally breaking unexpectedly during the early-access phase. Understand you are purchasing a work in progress, as well as future updates. The price will increase as bugs are worked out and the game is built up.</em></p>\n\n<p>Mizu is being built with\u00a0help and inspiration from a large, loosely knit community of people who love to rollerblade.</p>\n<p>Join us on Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/2BF5ya8fsz<br/>Follow us on IG:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/playmizu/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41dc985cc43657e0df008a43171d06a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["levigideon"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
