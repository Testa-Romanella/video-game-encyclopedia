Long story short, Akaijo didn't get the girl and now he's got a grudge against\u00a0Dovaden. His pettiness knows no bounds. He stopped sending birthday cards every year, ghosted him on SnapDragon, and for Christmas he refuses to send anything but an ugly sweater. Nia isn't spared of his wraith either and\u00a0his most recent antic finally made her snap.</p>\n<p>The moment Nia arrived at the Sakura Isles with her girlfriend Kaylee, the famous magical girl with the moniker Miss Kitty,\u00a0\u00a0he sent his army of oni to ruin their fun. But Nia and Miss Kitty aren't going to take this lying down.\u00a0 Enough is enough.\u00a0They've been planning this trip for months! So it is your job as the player to fight through waves of oni using Nia as your sword and Miss Kitty as your shield and take down Akaijo.</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> to move</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> to shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong> to switch character</p>\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\r\nThe Team:\r\n<p>Kuronami42: Programmer and Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Rabbidking:\u00a0Programmer and Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Me: Character and Background\u00a0Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>JonahM: FX Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Luner: UI Artist\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T14:02:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee78ea084cbee2c66a0c1ba1205bfb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
