I had an idea and wanted to see if I could turn it into a reasonable looking playable game within a week, which I have. The entire game including art/code (but not the font: https://www.dafont.com/cursive-3.font) was made within this week timeframe.\r\n</p>\r\nPotential updates\r\n<p>\r\nAs Arithmagician was only made in a week, there are a few potential items which had to be cut. For instance within the level select there are options for \"WIP: English\" and \"WIP: Science\". Outlined below are a few ideas which have not been implemented but might be at some point in the future... *might be*\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added subject options: Originally I wanted the game to cover the three typical subjects of maths, English and science. You would be able to switch between these three subjects with Q and E. Each would have different attacks as listed below. Additionally, there would be specific enemy types which can only be destroyed by the specific subject attacks</li>\n<li>English Subject option: \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" ~ A large pen looking ethereal sword swings out in a large arc destroying any nearby enemies</li>\n<li>Science Subject option: \"Science grenade\" ~ a small charge flies out to the point clicked and exploding when it reaches there, damaging all enemies in a small radius</li>\n<li>More complex maths questions: Currently it is simple addition and subtraction, but multiplication and simple algebra could be added</li>\n<li>Highscore/Grade tracking: showing the player their highscore/grade on the main menu for selected options</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5ddff0a8ab7b508449bc25efc9f9bb4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Plucky"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
