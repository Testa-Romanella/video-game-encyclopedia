Your goal is to reach the end of each level (Downward arrow) while avoiding enemies and spikes. Moving around and attacking is done by picking action from the list. This will start your turn and after it finishes, enemies will get their own. When you want to move, you need to choose jump height and distance. It might be hard to get used to at first, so make sure to try it out for a bit. Additionally you need to keep an eye on stamina meter, you won't be able to perform actions if it gets too low. You can always regenerate it by using \"Guard\" from combat moves, or by drinking stamina potion! Killing enemies gives you XP, collect enough and you will be able to level up. With each level you gain more stamina, and every so often you unlock extra stamina potion. Oh, and you can stun enemies by jumping on them.</p>\n\n\n<p>Update:<br/>Fixed stun effect not going away after it ends or enemy is killed.<br/>Fixed collision with background tiles on level 3 which made it impossible to complete.<br/>Fixed death sound stacking when killed by spike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89b/89bdc24d004e273e5931466253fba488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jakupf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
