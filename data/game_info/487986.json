But be careful, one hit to the ground and your plane will crash!</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move the plane around the scene. Left/Right make the plane turn that direction. Up/down makes the Tail go in that direction (Vertical input is reversed).\u00a0 Use the Space Bar to shoot your limited 10 rockets at the 5 targets. The 'escape' key will pause the game for you.</p>\n<p>This was my first try for something similar to\u00a0a game, as I am just beginning as a programmer, so I would love some feedback on Game Play and UI if possible. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Sorry there is no HTML build, it was having unfixable errors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T02:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd32007cbafd856498761026a1ce709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DCoolMan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
