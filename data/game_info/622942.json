Now on the brink of destruction humanity mounts one last final effort to take out this alien menace for good.</em>\n<em>You are Earth's greatest pilot and you alone hold the fate of mankind in your hand!<br/></em>\n<p>I have always loved retro style arcade games so I thought I would try my hand at making one for my self. With ship upgrades, power ups and an assortment of enemies and bosses I put allot of heart into this game.</p>\n<p>Like my other games this serves as more of an interactive portfolio for me to demonstrate my sound design and audio programming skills!</p>\n<p>I feel I have allot more I can do with this game in the future so I have already planned out some awesome new additions to the game like different playable ships, more stages and environments, new interesting enemies and a ton of new songs and SFX.<br/><br/>If you do find any bugs or notice anything weird please message me and let me know!</p>\n<p>Thank you for downloading</p>\n<p>W.</p>\n\n<p>Soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/chris-wadey/sets/ice-soundtrack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T05:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022acebf1c2ccb9cc8e1d13c2ffd8fd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wadey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
