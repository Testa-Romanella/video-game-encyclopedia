The labyrinth consists of more than 100 rooms and many corridors. In order not to get lost, open the doors and leave them open, so you will know that you have already been here and you should not go back. Use the flashlight by pressing the \"F\" button. The sound in the game creates the atmosphere of an abandoned basement. Ready, then go ahead, find a way out and get out of this maze.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T08:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b52630ae0065250f27a607f354e2053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HORGAME"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
