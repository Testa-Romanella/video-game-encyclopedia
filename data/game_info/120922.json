Always thinking that they know best. Well they don't. Always recommending stupid ingredients, they should just do their own job and stop pestering you while you cook. You've got critics in tonight too, so don't muck it up!</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cooks will periodically offer ingredients for your lovely broth. Each ingredient has qualities like: sweet, spice, salt, sour &amp; savoury, that it will add (or take) from the dish. If you don't want the ingredient added though, you can slap 'em upside the head with your spatula by clicking the left mouse button. Your goal is to get a balance of each flavour. Aim to get as many flavour bars as possible within the golden markers &amp; keep them there, to score. Bonuses for getting them right in the middle!</p>\n<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pepper (The red thing): ++Spice, +Sweet</p>\n<p>Onion\u00a0(The stripy brown): +Spice, +Savoury</p>\n<p>Chocolate\u00a0(Mmmm, chocolate): ++Sweet, -Savoury</p>\n<p>Chicken\u00a0(Drumstick yeah): ++Savoury, +Salt</p>\n<p>Fish (Good source of omega 3!): ++Salt, +Savoury</p>\n<p>Potato (The thing that looks like sick, drawing pixel potatoes is hard yo): -EVERYTHING BUT SAVOURY</p>\n<p>Lime (It looks green and limey): ++Sour, -Savoury</p><p>These have other minor +'s &amp; -'s too but I'll leave to ya'll to figure out!</p>\n<p><strong>OTHER INFO:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a game made for #LDJAM 40: The more you have the worse it is.
