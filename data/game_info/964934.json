They switch places and trigger a wild emotional storm making sure you never get bored of playing.<h3>Two heroes, two different genres. TRY IT OUT!</h3><br/>Ashen Knights is a unique mixture of two complementary gameplays. Tired of managing your stamina and scrupulously calculating your attacks? The game will grant you an opportunity to destroy foes in dozens with a single sweep of your weapon. Bored without a decent challenge? Try slaying an enemy ten times stronger than you are.<br/><br/><h3>More genres mean more emotions. FEEL THEM ALL!</h3><br/>In Ashen Knights, the gameplay is but a way to share and express emotions. Playing as different characters, you'll feel how your battle drive gets replaced with crippling anxiety that slowly transforms into blinding rage.<br/><br/><h3>Every detail matters. DIVE IN!</h3><br/>All of your emotions, every sound, every note, and every detail are a hidden message from the game world. And just as the world of Ashen Knights is a myriad of remote isles shattered by the Abyss, its narrative is a grim and mysterious puzzle made of numerous manifestations. Will you be able to piece it back together?<br/><br/><h3>A dark fantasy story. REVEAL IT!</h3><br/>Every single phenomenon in the game\u2014from the quietest of sounds to the biggest of bosses\u2014is just a cover hiding the story of this world. So, what is the nature of the Abyss? What does it have to do with our heroes? And how does it bring them together?<br/><br/><h3>Every battle tells its part of the story. DEFEAT ENEMIES!</h3><br/>The Abyss is not going to reveal its secrets for nothing. For every answer, one has to pay with numerous battles against its spawn: multiform mutants, insidious mimics, and mighty bosses.<br/><br/><h3>Every location is the same story told in a new way. EXPLORE THEM!</h3><br/>The Abyss is not going to reveal all its secrets right away. On every level, it will expose itself in a new, previously unknown way. It will keep getting you back to the very beginning of the location. It will throw immortal enemies at you. It will stab you in the back with no chance to defend yourself. But no matter how dissimilar the distant corners of this world seem, they are all united by the narrative of collapse and the atmosphere of dark fantasy.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T02:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e98d1a43227c2918f50fb30650bd561d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 523, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baykal Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boneshakers"], "esrb_rating": null}
