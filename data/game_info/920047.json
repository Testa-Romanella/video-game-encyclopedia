Spread your roots to access nutrients and release spores to extend your reach. Watch your colony grow over the course of a year. Keep the colony alive - if only for the sake of Charlotte, our adorable mushroom mascot.</p>\n<p>Made for the 2023 Global Game Jam.</p>\n<p>This game is more of a demo than anything - there's no current end goal and we were unable to implement some features. We're still quite proud of it, though. I'm working on uploading the WebGL version, but you can play the game on windows by downloading the .exe in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art and Music - Zoe, Ian\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming - Cole, Mike</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/9818249c7c3df70ce43a0bd99c524ca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alabastercrane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
