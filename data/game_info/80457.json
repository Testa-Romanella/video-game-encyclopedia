To crack blocks you have to connect a specific number of blocks with the same color. Therefore, you will get different kind of various colored blocks at the bottom line that you have to lift up.<br/>If you have a cracked block group on the map, you can easily remove it by placing another block with the same color beside it. Important is that the block directly touches the cracked group. If this is the case, not only this block and the cracked block group will disappear, all other blocks lying on the cracked block group will disappear too. This special feature allows you to clear large parts of the map with just one move. <br/><br/>If a block on the map gets into the lift zone (yellow/black striped area), you will lose a life and the zone will be cleared extensively. You have 3 lives and if you lose them all, the game is over.<br/><br/>You have a score indicator, a removed blocks tally counter, a level indicator, and a next block preview. Furthermore, in multiplayer games you can see the current rank of each player.<br/><br/>CrackBlocks provides two game modes: Push and Mine. <br/>Push mode is an endless game, where you get more and more new block lines that you have to crack and remove. <br/>In mine mode your mission is to clear the complete map as fast as possible. The score is counting down, until you have removed all blocks on the map.<br/><br/>The new mission mode sets you tasks to complete predefined maps with predefined blocks. The goal here is to complete the map with a given number of blocks.<br/> <br/>* Features<br/>- Classic &amp; Mission mode<br/>- 2 different kinds of classic game types (Push and Mine)<br/>- 3 different levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, and Hard)<br/>- Local and online highscore<br/>- Multiplayer games via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi <br/>- Multiplayer games support up to 4 players<br/>- Mods to modify the gameplay<br/>- Retina display support", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe768daa6ed23b51fc25d9603c4c3e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Benjamin Zachey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Zachey"], "esrb_rating": null}
