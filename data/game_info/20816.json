By satisfying the needs of your population, constructing new buildings and managing the production, you will unlock new buildings and face new challenges as your population\u2019s demands and consumption habits evolve. Soon, one island won\u2019t be enough to satisfy all their needs and you\u2019ll have to discover and claim additional islands and connect them via ship trading routes to your main island. For the first time in the Anno series, players have the opportunity to be part of a giant empire and get organized in powerful guilds to work towards joint goals and server-wide quests. A key element is the trade of goods with other players creating a social environment of continuous player-to-player interaction for the first time within this traditional franchise.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-10T20:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35ab605cb64e6bba457e5c356bc6cc24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.25, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 251, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Blue Byte"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
