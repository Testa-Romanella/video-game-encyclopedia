Unfortunately, the full physics-based motion I originally made doesn't translate well to computer controlled AI.</p><p>Speaking of AI, Terry has a modest amount of it himself. When he has nothing to do, Terry will explore, but if he gets thirsty, he'll drink; tired, he'll sleep; and if he sees a tasty centipede he'll get a delicious snack :)</p>\n<p>I had a ton more ideas about implementing games, dancing, and the ability to pet terry, but I ran out of time :(</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Font: Mario 64 by bunnywhip<br/>https://www.dafont.com/mario64.font</p>\n<p>Walking sound: Spider Chattering by SpookyModem<br/>https://freesound.org/people/spookymodem/sounds/202108/</p>\n<p>Drinking sound: Drinking02.wav by nickyg11p<br/>https://freesound.org/people/nickyg11p/sounds/390855/</p>\n<p>Snore: Cartoon Snoring.wav by ShadowReaper2814<br/>https://freesound.org/people/ShadowReaper2814/sounds/490743/</p>\n<p>Chewing: Chewing, Carrot, A.wav by InspectorJ<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/412068/</p>\n<p>Squeak: skiffy8.wav by tix99<br/>https://freesound.org/people/tix99/sounds/379235/</p>\n<p>Button: SciFi button press by peepholecircus<br/>https://freesound.org/people/peepholecircus/sounds/196979/</p>\n<p>Death Sound: 8 bit Death sound by MentosLat<br/>https://freesound.org/people/MentosLat/sounds/417486/</p>\n<p>Music: 8 Bit Chillout! by HeatleyBros<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T07:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5faa8797b572aca5aecb78d66e32d146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nate Smith"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
