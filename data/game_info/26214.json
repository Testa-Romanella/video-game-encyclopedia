Santa's having \n      some fun and wants you to play along too! You can help Santa decorate \n      the tree by removing the presents and ornaments that he stacks. When you \n      consecutively connect packages without missing a beat, you get extra \n      points. Oh boy, what a treat! Collect as many candy canes as you can \n      because when you collect enough, Santa will add a special star to the \n      game that can greatly help you get through a level or just bring some \n      additional fun!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/33174d4281aabd0aa4c15cbfcd9068c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["JV Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
