However finding out it's no longer 1999 the best way to do that was to bring it to the PC. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay is simple.  Place up to 3 arrows at once to direct the bananas to reach your base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is specially designed for local multiplayer.  It most shines with 4 players and controllers.  If needed computer controlled characters can fill in to make it 4.  Full controller support in the game, but not the launcher.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose your settings (time, powerups, etc) and then begin a series of 39 levels in rapid-fire succession.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe level maker offers players the chance to build 10 custom levels and play them the same way the default levels are played (just enable the ones you want).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpawned objects:<br/>\r\nBananas (1 pt)<br/>\r\nSpores (-12 pts)<br/>\r\nBanana Bread (12 pts)<br/>\r\nGrapes (1 of 9 random events).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPowerups (activated by a monkey coming into contact after being placed):<br/>\r\nExplosive -  Destroy walls and arrows, will temporarily knock down a player that runs into them.<br/>\r\nTornado - Will render a player unable to move for 5 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have suggestions for new features or improvements, put them in the Steam forums for the game, I will read them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854fd3049498e5bca1df26dc9a2a5b49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 24}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mage Journey"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flying Baby Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
