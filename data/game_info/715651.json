Town that was once a synonym of greatness<br/>is now facing a military conflict. Constant fear, tension and insecurity. Danger awaiting on<br/>every corner. It is war. No food or water, tents as temporary shelters. There are no friends or<br/>allies, everyone can be the enemy. Fighting to survive, no matter the consequences. There\u2019s only one goal: save the lives of others, and live yourself.<br/><br/>The game<br/>In the ruined city of Aleppo, nothing is as it seems.<br/>As a sapper, you have to face the unknown, hostile cityscape and demine it.<br/>It is not going to be easy, improvised explosives are everywhere. You have to stay alert at all times - it takes one move to activate the mines hidden in the bikes,<br/>cans and doorframes. Everything can be a deadly trap. Civilians are in constant danger and it is your job to protect them. The enemy can attack anytime, any place. You have to stay focused, save as many lives as you can. The pressure is high and the clock is ticking.<br/><br/>Realism<br/>The game takes place in the middle of real military conflict. Once known from its greatness,<br/>Aleppo is now ravaged by constant warfare. People are dying every day, and those who survive face losing everything they had, everyone they loved. Each and every one of them depends on your abilities to save them. But time is short, and you are only one man - not every bomb will be defused, not every threat will be dealt with.<br/><br/>Collab<br/>From the very beginning military experts were involved in the project to reflect reality as<br/>accurately as possible. While making the game we worked closely with C-IED ( Counter-<br/>Improvised Explosive Devices) specialists that shared their knowledge of building and<br/>defusing bombs. Officers of the polish GROM Special Unit, one of the best in the world, specialised in this field like no other, provided us with extensive support in recreating the technical aspects and possible battlefield scenarios.<br/><br/>Features<br/>Neutralise IEDs scattered among a besieged city.<br/>Control bomb disposal drones and employ professional explosive detectors.<br/>Search for and defuse mines in the least obvious places and objects.<br/>Save civilian population and gain extra points each mission<br/>Increase your skills, rank and resources with each success, lose them whenever defusal fails.<br/>To succeed you are going to have to:<br/>Cooperate closely with other soldiers- after all you are one of the most<br/>important people on the battlefield<br/>Make tough decisions about civilian lives- defuse the bomb on the spot, or clean the<br/>perimeter and move the explosive somewhere safe, trading safety for time.<br/>Deal with the stress - your skills, precision and chosen<br/>methods are a matter of life or death for civilians<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T03:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66db6086449d050220e420fbbc9cc4ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bnayat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bnayat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
