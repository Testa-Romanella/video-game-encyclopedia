The idea is inspired by the 2014 Shanghai stampede. \u00a0When a stampede occurs, people can only keep on running, or they will be pushed down by others and get injured. In this game, you have to run through the pacic crowds to find your son, and you can save other people. It's more like a little story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf4077bf0f38be9c5352a6b17cac532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["lunarDust"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
