Except you can't directly control the ship ! Instead, you control a lil dude that will press buttons to move the ship. The layout changes every 20 seconds, and sometimes colors are swapped to confuse you even more. Will you manage to survive ?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\u2014 Arrow keys to move.<br/>\u2014 X to jump.<br/>\u2014 C to get the box, release to throw/drop it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Additional notes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Made using kdx's LZY, web build powered by emscripten.
