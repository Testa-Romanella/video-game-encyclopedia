However, there's a catch!</p>\n<p><strong>Two or more players are co-operating to control the android at once!</strong> And there's another catch! Every time the Android passes through a Logic\u00a0Gate, the rules that govern who gets to control the Android change!</p>\n<p><strong>OR</strong>: Any player can control the Android!</p>\n<p><strong>AND</strong>: All players must synchronise their controls to move!</p>\n<p><strong>XOR\u00a0</strong>(Exclusive Or): Only one player can move the Android at a time!</p>\n<p><strong>NOT</strong>: The Android will perform an action\u00a0if NOBODY is pressing a control!</p>\n<p><strong>RACE MODE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Play with four or more players to activate RACE MODE, where the game becomes split-screen and the teams have to compete to try and reach the exit first!</p>\n<p>There are three levels.
