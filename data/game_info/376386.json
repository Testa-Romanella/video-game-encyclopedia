{"id": 376386, "slug": "kakuro-game", "name": "Kakuro Game", "name_original": "Kakuro Game", "description": "<p>Also known as Cross Sums, Kakuro is a mix between a crossword and sudoku puzzle. Unlike a crossword puzzle where the clue is a word or phrase, a Kakuro clue is a number that the corresponding answer cells must add up to. That\u2019s where the sudoku part comes in. Each clue has at least 2 and no more than 9 answer cells. Each answer cell must be a single digit (1-9). Duplicate digits are not allowed within a clue (4 = 1+3, 4 \u2260 2+2).</p>\n<p>My advice is to stick with it. It doesn't take long to pick it up and once you do you'll be hooked.
