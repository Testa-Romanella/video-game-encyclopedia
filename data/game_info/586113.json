Viewer discretion is advised. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf the gaming publishers were social media this game would be a shitpost. You play as DeShawn whose ship crashes on the island of Dedade and you must repair <br/>\r\nand supply the ship to set sail but not before learning and exploiting this island to his advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is the first game I ever made. I didn't know RPG Maker MZ was a real engine. I thought it was like Mario Maker so when I started making this game I was blown<br/>\r\naway from how much it could do. It was a great learning experience from beginning to end. I definitely bit off more than I could chew. Now I wish RMMZ had a little more stuff in it but plugins and parallax scenes were outside the scope of my first game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI truly hope you enjoy this game and if so then tell your friends! Word of mouth is everything!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMuch Love,<br/>\r\nBlue Milk Studios.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/600/6000b1b665b64a793c3bd919378c71fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Milk"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blue Milk"], "esrb_rating": null}
