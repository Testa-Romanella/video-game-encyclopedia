The IP is shown in the middle of the developers, and if they all die or the IP gets compromised, the game will end.<br/><br/>Waves of pirates and greedy developers will want your IP at all costs, and you'll have to take them out in order to proceed. The other developers will have their own IP, and you will have to decide whether you want to destroy it or just take them out. This decision will influence the deal with the publisher.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>WASD - Every key corresponds to one of the quadrants the developers can be located on. When pressed or hold, it will do the attack or hold ability of the developer on top of that quadrant.<br/><br/>Arrowy keys - Move the IP and the developers around the screen.<br/><br/>Q and E - E rotates the developers around the IP clockwise, and Q counterclockwise.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>Musician (the one with the keyboard):<br/>- Button press: shields himself to absorb upcoming attacks, each attack absorbed will become 1 charge (max. 6 charges).<br/>- Hold button: when released, it will consume 3 charges and heal all the group.<br/><br/>Designer (the one with the book and pencil):<br/>- Button press: powerful melee attack.<br/><br/>Programmer (the one with the gloves):<br/>- Button press: shoots a projectile that deals less damage but if it kills an enemy it will grant a charge (max. 4 charges),<br/>- Button hold: when released, it will consume 2 charges to heal the IP.<br/><br/>Illustrator (the one with the digital pencil):<br/>- Button press: shoots a projectile on a straight line.<br/>- Button hold: when released, shoots a powerful projectile that deals more damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f76/f76c02fd5723f57b75ab60b09f0199eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nyacu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
