Entitites have self simple AI and you can't control them, you are only able to spawn/destroy them or configure their pattern and stats. All entities will automaticly attack others that are different from themselves. Make them fight or just enjoy the visual, of them raoming around. You can choose 4 different types of entities:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Blue:</strong> Shoot straight bullets and moves in circle</li><li><strong>Red:</strong> Shoot guided missiles and moves in increments of 45 degrees</li><li><strong>Green:</strong> Run away from danger, spray toxic gaz behind him and moves in circle</li><li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Run away from danger, leaves mines behind him and moves in increments of 45 degrees</li></ul>\n<p> You are able to change the time scale to go faster, slower or stop time, to place them more easily, before letting the war begin or just speed up the process, seing which entities will dominate with time. Feel free to create the most epic battles or just watch these little entities live together!<br/></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________         </p>\n<p><strong>VICTORY CONDITIONS:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>None, it's not a game but a toy, you can't win or loose, there is no goal, just play for fun as long as you want!
