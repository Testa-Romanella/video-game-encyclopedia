The player&#39;s goal in each level is to guide two fish, one large and one small, to the exit by moving various objects around. The fish can lift objects and push them along surfaces, and some objects (steel ones) can only be moved by the bigger fish. Be careful though, if an object falls onto or is pushed onto one of your fish the fish will die.</p>\n<p>The seventy levels are arranged into eight branches which open up as the game goes on, so the player has a bigger choice of puzzles to try. Careful thought and planning is needed to ensure that the fish can escape unharmed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T01:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a6079592eb776b185ce17591309a0018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Linux", "PSP"], "developers": ["Altar Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
