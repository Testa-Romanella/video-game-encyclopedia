Your goal is to navigate 'levels' of transactions, where if you find a transaction that looks funny, flag it. Once you have flagged all suspicious transactions, you can use the G-Code to submit it for review and possibly proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD for moving the cursor.<br/></p>\n<p>F flags the transaction below your cursor, toggling between 'normal' (with no flag) or suspicious (with a ! flag).</p>\n<p>G opens the G-Code menu, for some Macros, These magic-like pieces of code will allow you to highlight some transactions for your personal review, submit the current spreadsheet to your supervisor or other things. Inside the G-Code menu, press the number of the command. Be aware that G-Codes use up some time toward your deadline.<br/></p>\n<p>H opens a quick Help file.<br/></p>\n<p>If a prompt or screen opens up, you can close it with Enter.</p>\n<p>And watch out for Gridbugs. If they touch your active cell, your accounting software will freeze up for 10 minutes, bringing your deadline that much closer.</p>\n<p>There are only three levels at this time.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun.</p>\n<p>Made using Unity and FES Retro Game Framework.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea06eb0c2e5776c80cf731f34f1f2d8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
