It was developed by ACE Team.</p>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the myth of Sisyphus. The main objective of the player is to use a giant boulder in order to destroy the enemy castle located at the bottom of the hill while at the same time defending your own stronghold using various structures. Players can build money farms to raise the funds necessary to build defensive structures or upgrade the boulder itself. After gathering a certain amount of money it is possible to equip both defensive and offensive upgrades to the boulder. The enemies can destroy the boulder in which case the player has to wait until the boulder spawns again and proceed with the offense. The player wins if they successfully destroy the enemy&#39;s castle gates and place the boulder right in the center of the castle. </p>\n<p>There are five distinctive time periods present in the game, such as romanticism, rococo, renaissance, and so on.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2011-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T14:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5fc584aefc66dec235715908eb2316b.jpg", "website": "http://www.atlus.com/rockofages", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 1493, "beaten": 114, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 88, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 204, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 207, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["ACE Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Atlus USA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
