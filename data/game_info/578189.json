{"id": 578189, "slug": "excavator-simulator-vr", "name": "Excavator Simulator VR", "name_original": "Excavator Simulator VR", "description": "Excavator Simulator VR is a short showcase of what it feels like to operate a giant 90 tonne excavator in either ISO or SAE control patterns. This includes real-time digging, boom/bucket movement, and tank-like movement. Explore levels to climb up hills or dig a mega hole to the ocean. There are no limits even if you prefer not to complete the levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ever wondered what the difference between heavy machinery controls is or want to improve your excavation skills while in the office? After a few hours of gameplay you will be the best virtual operator there is. You will be able to control an excavator in either ISO and SAE control patterns without hesitation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Want to dig a hole or go swimming in your excavator? There is nothing stopping you from doing anything. Go dig that swimming pool of your dreams or pile up a mountain of dirt.<br/><br/>No extra hardware is required. If you have a VR headset compatible with SteamVR, then you have a virtual cab and can interact with joysticks and levers using your virtual work gloves. You do not even need to have audio speakers as there is no audio currently in the game.<br/><br/>It is suggested to sit in a chair while playing this game to reduce potential for motion sickness. Similar guidelines as racing VR games.<br/><br/>*Note that this game is mostly intended for showcase and education purposes so it only contains three tutorial levels all of which are open world (meaning you are not limited by the tutorial itself).<br/><br/>**This game is not a substitute for proper excavation training and is only intended as an introductory course on the basics of excavator controls. Virtual training may aid in actual excavator operation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T02:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/320ba70b19b6e58c5d6a07f67951081e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrJohnWeez"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["MrJohnWeez"], "esrb_rating": null}
