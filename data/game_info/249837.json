The selected peg can only move to a hole if there's another peg between itself and\u00a0the target hole. A successful move eliminates the peg that the selected peg passed over.</p><p>You win if you can eliminate all pegs but one from the board.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This was originally done as a coding test for a game studio a long time ago, but I still occasionally boot it up to play it and see if I can remember how to beat it.
