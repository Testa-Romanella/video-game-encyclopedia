Though The Dark Side is full of dungeons and traps, it is the safer place of the two. The Light Side, though bright and beautiful, is quite a dangerous place. Creatures inhibiting The Light Side are tough as hell (and sometimes very mean) in order to survive. Traveling between the worlds is sometimes dangerous too. The last thing you want is to get lost in the In-between Space.</p>\n<p>The story is about two friends, Spirit and Ed, who got stuck together in the duo world.<br/></p>\n<p>Control:</p><ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Z to interact with NPCs and to confirm</li><li>X to cancel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T11:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/6981ed6847e582b5a6cc9cb3eea31f01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dawranliou"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
