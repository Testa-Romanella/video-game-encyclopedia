{"id": 359281, "slug": "repressed-2", "name": "Repressed", "name_original": "Repressed", "description": "In Repressed you play as a shadow of your own persona on a journey within your Memory Palace. The fact that you\u2019re lacking your usual 3D posture is significant not only for the story you\u2019re about to experience but more importantly for the way you play. When compared with a real being, a shadow, by its nature, is subject to different laws of physics. It needs light to exist, and dark places are its biggest enemy. Shadows always need a surface onto which they can slip, so when it comes to negotiating obstacles, you\u2019ll need to figure out smarter ways than simply jumping over them. Remember that your shadow self will transform depending on the angle of light, and that changing perspective or camera view might be of key importance to solving certain spatial puzzles.
