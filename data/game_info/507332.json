Your task is to ensure that every package is pushed onto a goal square, through programming a set of robots.</p>\n<p>The catch? Each robot is only able to execute a looping set of instructions. So, you can't hard code the exact path for solving the puzzle, you have to somehow fit it into a looping cycle.</p>\n<p>I'm very interested in any and all feedback!</p>\n<p>This game is open source, AGPL licensed: <br/>https://github.com/HoneyPony/package-push<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149a2be1ac539aa233dfca5c1beca4bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Honey Pony"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
