Which is deadly for every living Being if exposed for even a few seconds. But after decades of Search he has found that beneath the Valley\u00a0lies a dungeon. In Hope its way will lead him to the Relic he longs for.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As the Dungeon is not only 300 years old, but also has witnessed a great War and the downfall of the human race, Miasma from the Valley has seeped through the earth and into the Dungeon. Sometimes you can just evade it, but on a few occasions your only Choice is to go through the clouds, even if it means taking Damage. Find Crystals throughout the Dungeon to secure a few Seconds in which your Health will not deplete.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The Scenery of the Dungeon shifts at some times to a Cave, which you will need to cross as the original Way has collapsed over time. But the Path in them is not an easy one.</p>\n\n<p>Another Danger can be found further along the way in a Room where Demons, after they adopted the human Land built and placed Platforms, which move due to Mana Crystal attached to them. But your Jumps need timing, as a false Step will plunge you into the abyss benath and bestow death upon you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>After a long, dangerous and unsure Journey you will indeed reach the Tower and on top of it the path ends in a spacious Throneroom. But will you really find the sought after Relic there?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to experience a bit more Story, there are 9 different Stone Plates scattered through the Dungeon which are telling\u00a0Background Information about Nilrem's World and the Dungeon itself.\u00a0While Interacting with them, even if you stand in Miasma, you won't get any Damage.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T14:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bde205bf396df846221e2c828940aa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NanoArk."], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
