{"id": 111868, "slug": "princess-princess-another-story", "name": "Princess Princess: Another Story", "name_original": "Princess Princess: Another Story", "description": "<p>One of the sub-episodes of the Princess Trilogy. Also known as Episode 1.5. </p><p>Or formerly known as Princess Princess V6. There were some change in plans on how the final project would look/start etc. So this defunct chapter is not usable anymore, due to all potential spoilers but it's still plot important. <br/><br/>So here you go! I still recommend you play the original PrinPrin then play this. Since you know, connected and all or some things won't make sense at all. There's also some freebies for defeating the final boss of the game that can be used for your game projects. Will you reign supreme?! <br/><br/>Download link to Freebies: https://www.mediafire.com/?641s1wz25iblrv6 <br/>Password: Get it when you defeat the final boss and after the credits! Just a reminder that the freebies are for RPG Maker use only!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc4a6bdd0d95bc4d2e8932889433b95f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Archeia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
