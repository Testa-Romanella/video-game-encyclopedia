Try your hand at one of three card games! Pick from Daifugo, \n      Speed, and Memory! Family Card Games displays appealing cel-shaded \n      graphics and endearing music, on top of the friendly competitive \n      match-ups. You can play 1P Daifugo, or play against up to three other \n      random players in an online match! You can also view your ranking and \n      see how you match up with players around the world! Both Speed and \n      Memory are available to play as well! Test your reflexes and card \n      prowess against another player in Speed to see who truly has the fastest \n      hands. Memory will test your mental capacity as you try to remember \n      where cards and their respective match are.
