But since it's been a year since i last coded a game\u00a0, i soon started to surrender to the power of bugs, things not working in general, giving up ideas.\u00a0 i felt disheartened after seeing how much time i had spent trying to fix errors, while i had done only the 10% that was in my head.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a co-op game where 2 players had the same objective and could help each other, without interacting directly. So they would pass each other objects, weapons, they would destroy obstacles for one another, etc.</p>\n<p>Well, obviously not possible. So i made a single player demo.</p>\n<p>You can switch between the 2 characters to help one proceed. The goal to win the game\u00a0is to collect all the little stars. The players have the same health, so be careful :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>I really wanted to make some good drawings too, but i really couldn't. so i made some quick ugly anonymous graphics on photoshop.</p>\n<p>I was ready to give up, but then i remembered that i'm learning. And this is a 48h jam . sooo... here it is, my little demo.\u00a0I'm so curious to see other people games :)</p>\n\n<p>If you're reading this, thanks for your attention.</p>\n\n\n<p>Sound Effects: freesound.org</p>\n<p>Graphics: Me<br/></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e13/e13852a8590bc25383cba8b1eb2b12fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lizgamedev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
