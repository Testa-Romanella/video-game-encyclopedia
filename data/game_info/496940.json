She is interested in knowing more about you and your stance on the Covid-19 pandemic, which she will discover through a series of respectful questions and discussion. The conversation is serialized and varies depending on your responses. The goal is to reveal and then confront any\u00a0potentially harmful or pseudo-scientific ideas players might have gained via disinformation, misconception, or personal feelings. This is accomplished through the unfolding relationship developed between the player and the game character over the course of the game.</p>\n<p>This game is to be implemented in HTML5 in order to promote portability and accessibility.\u00a0 In this way, the game can be freely shared via links and distributed via social media.</p>\n<p>Gameplay: The majority of the game will entail a discussion between the player and the game's main Character. There will be a few graphical scenes that will add customization options, and Easter eggs as an added bonus, but these will be limited so as to not distract from the main focus.</p>\n<p>Progress report: The game is still in early development, but all the backbone of the code is\u00a0complete. Art, music, and style are yet to be implemented.</p>\n<p>***This game is currently in early technical development and most of the features are not yet available***</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81c556379ffdf47f7999d8714cd5ab1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["happy_k"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
