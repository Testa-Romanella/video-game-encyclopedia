This means that, each particle is only attracted to a particle of a specific color. Likewise each particle is also repelled by a particle of a specific color. Users have the ability to create custom particles and place them on the screen to see how they interact. This process of creating particles\u00a0can either be customized or completely random. We hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff38a4fcd2d0d1f342aa72180fbfe7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["donttalkbacktomeboi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
