Players must dodge the hearts flying around the arena. Each player has 3 lives and will be unable to move once they run out of them, however their hit box will remain for the hearts to bounce off. Players can walk through other players in an attempt to have the other player bounce off the heart and therefore not get hit.</p>\n<p>controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>player 1 - WASD</p>\n<p>player 2- YGHJ</p>\n<p>player 3- OKL;\u00a0 \u00a0 (semicolon)</p>\n\n<p>known bugs:</p>\n<p>-sometimes a player will lose multiple lives at once (effectively losing in one hit)</p>\n<p>- if all three players die, then all win (just take the last person to survive as won)</p><p>- if you spam a direction into the wall, you can phase through it slowly\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0ce0d72e4ad07d63f03c9a74c78604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chrismichael"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
