However, buying it now will grant you access to the current and ALL FUTURE VERSIONS of the game, INCLUDING the final version.]<br/></p>\n<p>WELCOME TO DRACOFIGHTER\r\n  </p>\n<p>The 2-Button Dragon Fighter! Play as a dragon and fight others with  the incredibly simple control scheme! Experience the complexity of  fighting games without the complex inputs!\r\n    </p>\n<p>WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT ALL FEATURES WILL BE IN FINAL VERSION</p>\n<p>FREE DEMO AVAILABLE HERE: https://vecderg.itch.io/dracofighter-demo<br/></p>\n<p>--------<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>Buttons translate to LEFT, RIGHT, ATTACK, and SPECIAL respectively. <br/>ATTACK + SPECIAL = GRAB<br/></p>\n<p>P1 - (A) (S) (D) (F)\r\n    <br/>P2 - (Left Arrow) (Right Arrow) (&lt; Symbol) (&gt; Symbol) <br/></p>\n<p>Combining directions with attacks allows you to do unique moves!<br/></p>\n<p>Other controls (controller support exists!) can be seen in the Settings menu as the main menu points out. Custom controls will be implemented in the final game but are not a priority right now.<br/></p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>REGARDING FEEDBACK:<br/>Feedback is always an important but difficult subject, and there will always be a conflict between trying to follow my vision for the game and how others experience my interpretation of that vision. While any comments and especially feedback are appreciated on DracoFighter, <em>most feedback will probably not be implemented into the game</em> as a warning in advance, even if all of it will be read. I'll be relying mostly on my playtesters since I'm able to view their entire play sessions and know more about their backgrounds, along with being able to ask more thorough questions.<br/>Bug reports will always be welcome, but require a full video of the bug with Debug Mode on (Settings &gt; Debug Mode), otherwise it'll be much harder to understand and replicate.</p>\n<p>REGARDING TEAM MEMBERS:<br/>Many people have come up to me offering for help with the game and I'm really grateful for the offers, but I consider DracoFighter one of my dream games and prefer to have full control over it, along with my desire for self challenge. While DracoFighter might evolve to not be a solo project, I'll be the one approaching people rather than the other way around. I may be more open to team members for projects later on, but DracoFighter will not be the one.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a24ee42cbcaf54a352727ab3b94e62b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Vecderg"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
