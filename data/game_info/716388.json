They have forged a deal with the great Zzkrezzt to trade the planet\u2019s resources in exchange for money to use to protect Supremum-17. Once the asteroid onslaught is defeated, maybe then Astronaut 64 and their dear cat, Prudence, can live in peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>Defend the planet from the incoming asteroids until your refineries finish mining the stellar dust!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0to walk left or right\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll\u00a0to zoom in and out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0to jump\r\n</p>\n<p>Hold\u00a0to run\u00a0</p>\n<p>to continue dialogue</p>\n<p>\u00a0to interact with buildings or pick up objects/drop objects</p>\n<p>\u00a0to enter throwing mode while holding an object\r\n</p>\n<p>while in throwing mode to adjust the trajectory\r\n</p>\n<p>again while in throwing mode to throw the object</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the game, scrap will fall from the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So will asteroids!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pick up (E key) and throw (F or E key) that scrap into factories on Supremum-17.</p>\n<p>You can use that scrap to make towers boxes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Towers boxes can ONLY create towers by throwing (F key) or with the launcher</p>\n<p>To use the launcher, place the Tower Box in side it (E key) then interact (E key) with the launcher</p>\n<p>Build Refineries for 20 scraps to speed up your mining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Build Launcher towers for 5 scraps to throw towers more accurately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Build Laser towers for 15 scraps to destroy asteroids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Build Shield towers for\u00a015 scraps to project a shield to protect from asteroids\u00a0</p>\n<p>Build Collectors for 10 scraps\u00a0to collect scrap to transport to the factory</p>\n<p>Launch other tower boxes at the placed tower to upgrade them with a smaller effect of the thrown box.
