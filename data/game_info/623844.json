In an experiment in June 2021, test subjects were instructed to play the game for 10 minutes, then answer a survey. My concern was that, to date, frame rate has only been studied vis the benefits of higher FPS for twitch games and other precise tasks. Would test subjects be able to sense deliberate changes in frame rate to inform them of game state? And if so, what other applications could it be put toward?</p>\n<p>For more on this project, please visit the category on\u00a0my website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d3db2af3b1131529566e053dd11c6a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matt Rasmussen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
