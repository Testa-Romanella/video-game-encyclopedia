It captures the beauty, the excitement and the technology of the soaring sport.<br/><br/>Beside flying, the beauty of soaring sport is also the landscapes, the countrysides that we glide over. Therefore, we manage to integrate terrain data in this sim using high resolution satellite images and elevation. This resulted in a look real, beautiful landscapes with highly detail airport hangars and runways.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>* Thermal lift and ridge-lift<br/>* Multiplayer over the internet.<br/>* ASK-21 trainer glider with full function cockpit.<br/>* 360 degrees look around cockpit, and multi-touch zoom.<br/>* Realistic terrain with high resolution satellite images, detail airport: Utah (USA)<br/>* Realistic flight characteristic, accurate performance, wing-flex.<br/>* Realistic flight instruments, Total Energy Compensated variometer.<br/>* Winch launch take-off.<br/>* Thermal-lift, ridge-lift simulation.<br/>* Online competition.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b45/b455633e914bd4d9ace11bec0a8d3901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["PNTK"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Phanotek"], "esrb_rating": null}
