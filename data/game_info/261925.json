He's provided all sorts of ideas for games prior, but I deemed them \"too crazy\" to be made. So, I just let him loose for once and this three-world demo was the result. This masterpiece was made during the holy era for MLG and indie game memes, so you'll definitely spot a few references here and there.</p>\n<p>I didn't finish it due to beginning work on \"Alexander High\", which would eventually be cancelled right before the end of my senior year.
