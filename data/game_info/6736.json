Use your helium filled balloons to fly through diverse, colorful environments and collect all the stars. Watch out for birds, ninjas and spikey things and don&amp;#39;t fall into the water!<br/><br/>Helium Boy features full 3D Retina graphics with a cute artstyle. 8 challenging stages, all with unique environments and different types of gameplay. Full 3D gameplay, as well as a couple of traditional sidescrolling stages. Two difficulty modes: in beginner mode you can play the stages at you own pace and easily collect all the stars, but in normal mode the screen is scrolling automatically and constantly forces you to move forward, so you have to find the perfect route to get all the stars before they leave the screen.<br/><br/>Controls: <br/>The game uses an onscreen gamepad. Touch the directional pad to move in the character in any direction. Press the Jump button repeatedly to fly with the balloons. If the balloons pop, press the Pump button to get new ones, or jump around without them. You can also let go of the balloons at any time by pressing the Drop button.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b25a277698c21bc2a68bbe49699743ff.jpeg", "website": "http://www.beril.se/heliumboy", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bertil Horberg"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Bertil Horberg"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
