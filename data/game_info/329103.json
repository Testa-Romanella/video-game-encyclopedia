Only you can save it! Create an unbeatable party unifying all the nintendo series protagonists against all the bad guys! This role playing game is full of humour and is quite text based so there's not a lot of action to expect but the music is freaking awesome! Enjoy playing Nintendo Quest Demo! (The full version is still in progress and I need some feedback to continue my work.) Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T04:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55f9fa10d4bf04365891297dbfa50ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R42003"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
