Its main goals are to recreate the original analog system on digital media and interface with the original console, doing things with the original hardware that were unimaginable in the 1970's.</p>\n<p>Currently the software is playable as a pseudo-emulation of all of the original console's game cards, controlled with keyboard &amp; traditional gamepad controls, as well as a newly-designed 3D-printed arduino-powered controller that is meant to mimic the original console's controllers.</p>\n<p>Interface with the original console is currently limited but the project is in active development. We have hopes to fully integrate with the original hardware so that one user could play on this simulation and another on the original console -- seamlessly. Expanding on this same methodology, with some networking we hope to have two original consoles playing together over the internet, with our software as middle-man.</p>\r\nMore on the Odyssey Now\r\n<p>This is a project of the Vibrant Media Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. An Odyssey Now website is currently in development.</p>\r\nView the source code\r\n<p>Check out our github repo, here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a9/5a95df0a87dc36f6e697bb7cbcabec06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PatHealy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
