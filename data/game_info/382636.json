I went with an aquatic theme as I always thought futuristic boats looked nice. Features I added in contrast to the original Space Shooter include power ups, shields, unbreakable obstacles, extra lives when earning enough points\u00a0and a health bar. This game was designed for Windows platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:53:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/3949c9cc34519f905e8cef014a83d8a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachary Simon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
