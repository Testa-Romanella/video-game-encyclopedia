The main trope of the game is to build an army of pigeons by collecting them around the levels and beating the final boss, Goosek Son Of Goosdrin, the dark lord that dominates the pigeon kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, we have successfully rendered a tested vertical slice that was positively received by a sample of people. And so, Starfall Games has decided that for the team's first and opening game, we were going to release Pigeon Legion Demo v0.1 as an official demo game.</p>\n<p>Since the game is currently in a very early development state, we feel like we could benefit from updating the game as we develop it and release it publicly to receive feedback, adjust and learn a proper workflow to build and develop our little team.</p>\n<p>We do have project to work on subsequent demos with way more material along with long term plans to release a full game with this project. While this is so, we still have to take in account that everything is done voluntary, so we cannot assure a precise production schedule.</p>\n\n<p>For now, we have incorporated sound design, some basic UI, the basic game mechanics along with a very basic trope. The game is in early development but we are working almost every day to add and polish our content. As of version Demo v0.1, we have currently <strong>10 levels</strong> with <strong>23 pigeons</strong> to collect and various obstacles in the way. which gives about <strong>7 minutes</strong> of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Our next step for Demo v0.2 would be to incorporate <strong>10 more levels</strong> and <strong>raise the pigeon count to 50</strong> along with making names and flavor texts for each of these new pigeons. The demo's 'final' boss might also be part of the v0.2 version but that is yet to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>Now that a first release of the game has been released, the idea is to expand the game's scope the more we release updates. More story, more levels, more worlds, more bosses, more lore, <strong>more pigeons</strong>... this is what we are aiming for at the moment.</p>\n<p>The game is available for <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Mac</strong> for the moment. Thank you very much for dropping by! :)</p>\n<p>If comments and feedback seems to be positive enough, a community Discord will be created for people interested in keeping track of the development!</p>\n\n<p>itch.io : starfall-games.itch.io/pigeon-legion</p>\n<p>Twitter :\u00a0twitter.com/DevStarfall</p>\n<p>YouTube :\u00a0youtube.com/channel/UC8phrGzsx86J_6caffyFSKQ</p>\n\n<p>All <strong>audio</strong> assets were created by the game's director, <strong>overnightstories</strong> (Nicolas V\u00f6n Moreau). -\u00a0overnightstories.net</p>\n<p>Visual assets were found on <strong>itch.io</strong>, all of them which have <strong>CC0 licenses</strong> and are available to be used on both personal and commercial projects.
