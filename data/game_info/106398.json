During the past few months, we've watched a lot of videos of some of you playing Lives Out and sharing your thoughts live while going through the long tunnel. It helped us pinpoint a few obvious caveats that, without the constraint of time in a game jam, we have now fixed for good.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe've been working hard on a \"vertical slice\" of the game ie a very small area filled with lots of stuff to test all the ideas that we didn't have the time to include in the first demo. All in all we're not done yet with this, so stay tuned !\r\n</p><p>\n<em>- 2015/11/27</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\tVersion 0.1.3 is available ! It fixes random crashes on Windows 7 and control issues when maintaining a direction and still attempting to trigger an action. Make sure to download it if you got your hands on one of the previous versions.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>- 2015/11/25</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\tBig thanks to all of you who played Lives Out, shared it, and reported bugs to us. We are currently running more tests and working on a new patch.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn the meantime, we're also working on a true pilot episode, to expand the limited gameplay offered by this premise and give it more depth. In just 72 hours we just were not able to put everything we wanted into the game and we want to see it through.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMore interactions with the player surroundings, items to find and collect, scattered pieces of intel, puzzles to solve, scary encounters, what say you?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnd yes, a pilot episode, meaning there could be more. Don't you want to know what happens when our character reaches the station?\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Use left or right keys to move the character on screen</li>\n<li>Use Space to trigger actions or dialogues</li>\n<li>Use Enter, Escape and arrow keys to browse options in menus</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCode and audio: Christophe \"CarboHydroM\" Blondel - \r\n\thttp://carbohydromusic.com/\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPixelart: S\u00e9bastien \"Khnoum\" Canovas - http://khnoum.tumblr.com/\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Changelog</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tv0.1.3 (2015/11/27)\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Stable version on Windows 7 (at long last)</li>\n<li>Maintain consistent controls even when triggering an action and walking at the same time</li>\n<li>Make some short speeches unattended (torch and crowbar)</li>\n<li>Widen the ending detection area so that the game can always be completed when reaching the station</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tv0.1.2 (2015/11/20)\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Load story data from resources file in binary form to avoid a crash on all Windows systems (the game still crashed on Windows 7 for instance)</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tv0.1.1 (2015/11/19)\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Allow the player to complete the game without picking up the torch</li>\n<li>Bugfix : the game randomly crashed on start (Windows only) - tested successfully on Windows 10 only</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a2a144898e9d030d49f92b152696d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CarboHydroM", "khnoum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
