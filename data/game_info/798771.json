I completed this in probably 8 hours. It's not much and I may update it before the jam is over if I get a chance. I hope you enjoy a simple duck-hunting game! How many ducks can you hunt in ONE minute?</p>\n<p>SPECIAL NOTE: The levels are randomly-generated, so ponds will appear differently each time you play. (There's no mechanical differences to the ponds. It's all aesthetic.)</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Shoot as many ducks as you can in ONE minute. Shoot ducks to get kills. Shoot crates to pick up one of three \"boosts\" - $5 extra money, 5 extra ammo, or 5 extra seconds of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left Click - shoot gun / use buttons</p>\n<p>Mouse - move gun/cursor</p>\n<p>WASD - move camera around level</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e3029b799c9305bcca95d421e8748616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MetaphysicsStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
