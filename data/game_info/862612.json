It's special ingredient ? Love ! And maybe those pesky pulses that that supernova does <strong>every 10 seconds</strong>...<br/></p>\r\nInstructions, read it before playing\r\n<p>Use the 6 machines that you have to collect Water, Wheat, Biomass and use them in the Mill, Kneader or the Oven to make some Flour, Doughs and finally BREAD !\r\n</p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds, the supernova in the background will emit pulses of Fire (red), Water (blue) or Wind (green), each pulses type will impact in some way (bad or good) your surrounding.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the two tanks on the left. Any resources put in it will be save from any pulses as far as it stay in. With hints that will appear when touching machines, find the way to use bake that tasty Bread !\r\n</p>\n\r\nProcess to win (Spoiler) :\r\n<p>Each resource node have 3 levels. To get a resource from a node you must bring it its last level. To achieve this, you\u2019ll have to use resources on nodes. There are three base resources :\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Water from the well\r\n</li><li>Wheat from the crop\r\n</li><li>Biomass from the composter\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Then three transformed resources :\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Flour from the mill\r\n</li><li>Dough from the kneader\r\n</li><li>and finally bread from the oven\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Some nodes will require a \u201cpulse\u201d from the supernova. Every 10 seconds the nova will emit a pulse of one of those three types : fire, water or wind. Each node is affected by one of the pulse type. You can use resources from other nodes to upgrade them too, here how it works :\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Crop : Fire upgrade it, wind and water reset it\r\n</li><li>Well : Water upgrade it, wind and fire reset it\r\n</li><li>Composter : Wind upgrade it, water and fire reset it\r\n</li><li>Mill : Need wind and wheat to produce flour\r\n</li><li>Kneader : Need water and flour and player interaction to produce dough\r\n</li><li>Oven need dough and biomass and a fire pulse to make\u00a0<em>bread</em>\n</li></ul>\n<p><em>The well is the only node that can be always interacted with to be upgraded. So you always have water at your disposal.</em>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD and Space for action.
