Unlock new abilities and build your strength with alien energy, but beware of their weaponry. Damage will cause your tank to become unstable and lose energy. Terra Tanks lose more energy as they reach higher power levels, and running out of power will mean the doom of the human race.<br/><br/>The invasion is never ending. The Terra Tanks only hope is to destroy the mothership. <br/>Can you muster the strength to save humanity in our darkest hour?Credits<br/><strong>Soundtrack &amp; Audio Design:</strong> Kimo The Beatmaker.<br/><strong>Enemy &amp; Level Illustration:</strong> Fernando Angelo.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/57292525bca4dcf2c116635c0844b1bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moss Piglet Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moss Piglet Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
