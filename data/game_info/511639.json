The project was based on entertaining a blind person.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Video Games are usually visually appealing with their gorgeous graphics. A visually impaired person cannot see these games. My project assures you that even though they can see it, they can still play them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The working mechanism behind this is that blind people have an extreme sense of auditory skills. They can hear way better than an ordinary person. This is because they live their lives with touch and hearing to identify the environment around them.\u00a0<br/>As the sound plays a vital role in guiding a visually impaired person, mimicking proper sound effects will make them visualize the virtual world. They will be able to mentally recreate a map of how the player is moving through the virtual world all by utilizing their listening skills. Each minute audio detail designed by the Game Developer for the video game will help the blind imagine as realistic as possible. Thus, the ultimate theme of the game. The graphics for a blind person's video game lies in the sound effects given to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>( All the audio tracks used in this game does not belong to me. I used them because I like them. I make no profit out of this. It is just an experimental project done in school days.\u00a0)</em><br/></p><p>This game is an entire experimental one. It is a very simple maze. But, I kindly request you to wear headphones, close your eyes, and play the game. Test yourself, and see how well you can perform.</p>\n<p>The \"Coin sound\" means you are following the correct path. The \"Thud Sound\" means you are hitting an obstacle. Now go try out this simple game.<br/></p>\n<p>Do share your experience with others. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6b4a21b1630f9e2711b55c6776a6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Star Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
