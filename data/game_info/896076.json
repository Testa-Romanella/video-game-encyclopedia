The game is turn-based, you can choose from several actions, but you have limited action points. Then it's time for the Enemy's turn.<br/></p>\n<p>I still improve the game, after I finished the course. I keep adding new features and assets. The course included only basic game mechanics.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the assets (graphics, models, audio) are from public domain, some made by myself.</p>\n\n<p>Find game source code on Github: https://github.com/Ajver/CodeMonkeyTurner<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e2/0e2420c5fc5eeaa5b63f0505e46bf9e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ajver"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
