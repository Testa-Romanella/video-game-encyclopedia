Will our familiar characters live to see the outside world? Do they even want to see the outside world? Let's just pray they never have to go\u00a0 though a deadly defence, a deadly riddle, a deadly....class trial.</p>\n<p>{This is a fangame of the popular Danganronpa. All sprites, Backgrounds and Music belong to Spike Chunsoft and the creators of Danganronpa respectively unless stated otherwise in the credits. This takes place in a different universe to Dangan altogether, so the plot is altered and the characters act differently as to how they do in canon.} \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d40/d40a22d0a9a7dba78265bcffeb63fdc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigitalMonstrosity"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
