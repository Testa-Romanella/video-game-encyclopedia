Crimson Rite started as a two-day game jam project but we ended up spending around two months and shaped it into a short action-adventure game. We've tried to establish a world filled with interesting flavor bits story-wise with, in our opinion, a twisted ending. <br/>We have created all the assets from scratch and created five music tracks.</p>\n<p>We would like to express that we welcome and encourageall feedback.</p>\n<p>We hope that you play and enjoy our game.</p>\n<p>Thanks and cheers.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4e97e7f87b34989fe78fb7d680b9afc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["cnkrtn"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
