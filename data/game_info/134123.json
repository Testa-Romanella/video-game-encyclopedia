It's a little bit rough around the edges and I didn't get all the features I wanted implemented but I'm pretty happy with the result. </p><p>I really need to learn how to use some audio production software at some point so I can include passably decent audio in my future entries. </p><p>The game is fairly simple. Follow on screen instructions. The yellow waypoint appears above the next objective. For anyone who happens to be a rice farmer, I apologise for butchering your profession.</p><p>Some aspect ratios cut off the bottom half of the instructions. I recommend using 1280 x 600 for best results. </p><p>Controls:</p><p>W key: move forwards</p><p>S key: move backwards</p><p>A key: turn left</p><p>D key: turn right</p><p>mouse movement: move camera</p><p>E key: equip/unequip items and mount/dismount vehicles (this is a little dodgy and may take a few presses)</p><p>right click: use equipped item</p><p>Download link for unity project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6pqe2c9M3VENTg4NkIxMzczTUk/view?usp=sharing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e986736573714c817e0d79b92ea6df6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["inquisitivegeek"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
