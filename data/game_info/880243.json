Auto-pauses if you switch to other windows.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Since it's a mash-up of Manic Miner and Impossible Mission the story is miner Willy, several years after completing his adventure in the 20 lethal caverns, decides to go back in the caves only to discover that the mad professor (Elvin Atombender) has build there an underground complex.\u00a0</p>\r\nMission\r\n<p>Willy has to get keys (or flashing objects) in the 32 rooms, search furniture pieces to find puzzle pieces (or passwords to disable guardians temporarily or reset platforms). Once you have gathered enough pieces you can combine them into blocks so you can form a complete picture (a random drawing from Drawception) to discover the password. Finally use the password to unlock Atombender's control room and stop the threat (Atombender is about to launch missiles against cities).</p>\r\nDisplay\r\n<p>By default you get the Commodore64 mode; even during the game you could change the display\u00a0on-the-fly\u00a0to appear like ZX Spectrum, Vic20 (palette only) and PC EGA.<br/>For an extreme 8bit experience switch to\u00a0\"Speccy\" in the Options &gt; Sprite\u00a0rendering mode (only 2 colours per 8x8 block).</p>\r\nPuzzle Trainer\r\n<p>If you didn't play the original Impossible Mission you might want to familiarize with the puzzle (which is the final part of the whole game) by clicking the \"Puzzle Trainer\" to see how the piece-matching\u00a0works.<br/>Watch this video to see how to solve one (no spoiler, the pieces and drawing will be different every time).<br/>Basically you scroll up/down the available pieces (in the trainer you have them all, in the actual game you need to find those in the furniture) drag the pieces -with a particular shape in common- and release them in the slots at the center. Try to find a match, you can flip them horizontally and/or vertically and combine them dragging one on top of the other. Four matching pieces must be combined to form a block which can be moved on the slots to the right: if the orientation\u00a0and placement is correct a part of the password (***) will be revealed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T09:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e5b783e4cd5fe574567b5c9fd4c634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Heracleum"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
