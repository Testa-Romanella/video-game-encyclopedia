{"id": 282071, "slug": "speedway", "name": "Speedway", "name_original": "Speedway", "description": "Welcome to Speedway, a very simple arcade style driving game!\r\n<p>I was on vacation, and got bored sitting alone in the hotel, so I came up with a simple challenge: Make a game about traveling in under 60 minutes. I pulled out a timer, and got to work. It ended up taking 57 minutes from start to finish, and I didn't want to start another feature since I only had 3 minutes left, and I didn't want to end the challenge with an unfinished game.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this game was made under 60 minutes, so don't expect any quality at all out of it. It was just something fun I decided to do.</p>\n<p>Now back to the game itself. Your goal is very simple: to drive down the road, and avoid the randomly appearing cones on the street. The cones are generated procedurally, which means you can theoretically play the game forever, arcade style.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cff055d683f61d19a57b83efaa6956d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["V0LT"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
