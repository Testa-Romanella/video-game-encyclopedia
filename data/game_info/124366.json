You can download the version submitted for the jam at the bottom of the page. Changes include: accurately shows visited islands; correctly moves to a new map once all are visited; moves to a new map if you go off the edge.</p><p>The year is 16--.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You have been\u00a0hired as a ship's navigator, so\u00a0you should probably know how to\u00a0navigate!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The starting longitude\u00a0is known, so your first task is\u00a0finding your latitude with the\u00a0sun and your <strong>astrolabe</strong>. Left and right arrows\u00a0rotate the alidade.\u00a0 When a ray of sunlight shines\u00a0between the vanes press \"x\" to\u00a0adjust finely. The sunlight will\u00a0glint off of the lower vane when\u00a0close and will glint brightly if\u00a0the reading is within 1 minute\u00a0of accuracy either way. Press \"x\"\u00a0again to lock in the reading and\u00a0reference the corresponding\u00a0nautical chart.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>nautical chart</strong> for the correct degree of latitude will be chosen automatically so all you need to do is find your starting island with your minute reading. Up and down arrows cycle through\u00a0 islands and \"x\" selects. When you\u00a0have determined your location, give the helm a course of your choosing. Left and right arrows to pick course.</p>\n\n<p>Your ship only has enough food and water for a few days. if you sail close enough to an island, you will gain more supplies and make money. Visited islands are marked in green. To navigate the area, you will engage in the process of dead reckoning...</p>\n<p>Dead reckoning is approximating\u00a0your position based on speed and\u00a0direction readings at regular\u00a0intervals. these readings are\u00a0reported on the <strong>traverse\u00a0board</strong>. Left and right arrows cycle through\u00a0the peg holes, \"x\" selects one. [Note: the fractions on the traverse board are non-functional.]</p>\n<p>After sailing, first read the <strong>compass </strong>for your current heading, \"x\" to take you to the traverse board and report. After reporting, find the speed from the<strong> chip log</strong>. \"x\" to start the timer and count the knots that go by while the sand is flowing. \"x\" to return to the traverse board. Continue until filling the board...</p>\n<p>After you have reported 4 hours'\u00a0worth of readings, you will go\u00a0back to the chart and see your\u00a0dead reckoned positions for that\u00a0time. choose a new course and\u00a0repeat the process. If you visit\u00a0every island in the area, you\u00a0\u00a0can continue to a new area.</p>\n\n<p>Be warned! if your performance\u00a0doesn't satisfy the captain, you\u00a0will be replaced! If so, you can\u00a0then view the chart marked with\u00a0all of your dead reckoned marks\u00a0and every actual position.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c53/c537a864aa1ad99107745484d68ae5df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Odward Frenry"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
