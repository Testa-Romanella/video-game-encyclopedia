I learned that the collision points on the paddles\u00a0are suppose to be placed in a triangular shape so that the ball doesn't just go straight forward every time it makes contact and bounces off. So I figured why not just make them triangles instead. The new shape makes for a lot more radical bouncing angles giving more of an Arcady feel to the game. I also made a cool win state screen and touch controls so It should be playable on Mobile as well. Let me know what you thing of this concept on the comments below. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e50d202f144b4a95bdee17324e36136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The JL ZONE"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
