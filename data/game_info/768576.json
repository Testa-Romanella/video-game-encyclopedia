My chest heaved up and down as I was no longer used to exerting myself like this but I had to run. If I didn't run, It would catch up to me. Even now, I could still hear those wet, sloppy footsteps slowly approaching, as if, somehow, it was still right on my tail.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I just have to get to the power station,\" I continued to repeat to myself, \"I can call someone from there.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After running for what felt like forever, I could finally see the road, going toward the power station again which meant the station was only a short distance away. I was almost there and could try and call someone for help. As I ran, I looked back to see if that thing was still chasing me or if I could get a better glimpse of it before smashing into the trash can outside the power station. Old garbage from almost a week of work was strewn across the ground as I toppled over the can. Breathing heavily, I looked back to where I had run from, forgetting the trash can entirely, trying to find that thing to no avail. Pulling myself off the ground quickly, I ran to the service phone we had installed that was connected to the factory and began to dial before remembering something.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The power isn't working. That's why I came out here this late in the first place!\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked back toward the road where I came from and couldn't see anything but I couldn't get the sound of those footsteps out of my mind. In a hurry, I ran inside the dark power station and locked the door. The power station was small and only had 3 rooms inside, the breaker box for this building, the storage room, and a bathroom all connected by a single hallway. Inside I begin to feel my way around as I wait for my eyes to adjust to the dark. Slowly but surely, I felt my way toward the breaker room as my eyes were almost fully adjusted. Inside, I checked the breaker box and noticed that the battery slot inside was empty. Someone must have taken it out before they left. I knew we had some in the toolbox in storage and as I turned to go toward the door I heard it. The sound of those footsteps. Those wet, decayed feet slapping the ground, almost rhythmically. I knew this room had a lot of windows, as it used to be a greenhouse, and almost didn't dare look toward them until I saw the shadow. A tall, lanky shadow slowly appeared as the moon hit its back. I turned my head toward it and saw that face. That wicked smile. That twisted grin trying so hard, in vain, to be human. <br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Written by SilverTategami</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>Zapsplat - Audio</p>\n<p>SilverTategami - Lore Excerpt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b245b53051cc662e851a0594f2f5512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Victor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
