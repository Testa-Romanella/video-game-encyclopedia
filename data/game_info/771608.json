It's up to you to pilot our latest drone and strike back at our enemy using both bombs and AA missiles. Cats need aid, so on bonus stages drop aid packages for them for bonus points.<br/></p>\n<p>The drone is protected by armour, so can withstand 6 hits before becoming vulnerable.</p>\n<p>On completion of a stage, your armour will be partially repaired, and\u00a0all your ammo will be replenished.\r\n</p>\n<p>Watch out for anti-aircraft guns and SAM launchers.<br/></p>\n<p>Destroy trucks to gain more ammo. If you run out of ammo, don't worry; a friendly parachute will drop a fresh supply.</p>\n<p>Look out for air drops; they will drop either extra ammo, or an armour repair.</p>\n<p>Bonus points are awarded if a friendly farmer in his tractor manages to tow away a destroyed vehicle.<br/></p>\n<p>If the turret of a destroyed tank lands on another vehicle and destroys it, you gain an extra 100 points.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<p>Joystick in port 2, or Keyboard:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>S - Up.\r\n</li><li>X - Down.\r\n</li><li>&lt; - Left.\r\n</li><li>&gt; - Right.\r\n</li><li>SPACE - tap to drop a bomb (or aid package on bonus stages), or hold down to switch to air-2-air mode.
