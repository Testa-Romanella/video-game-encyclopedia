Hopefully this is acceptable within the terms of the game jam; if not, I still hope you enjoy.\u00a0Please say hello to the centipede for me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb4aa4d2387651c9464732523f87a289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PJsForDays"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
