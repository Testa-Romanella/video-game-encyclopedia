In your logic you yearn for the sun rather than the dank musty darkness of the factory. With only one instruction to use you should utilize the terminal next to you! Beware, rats have infested the factory and there is only one way out! Keep your light source up or else the darkness will creep in! Those rats will come in handy as they carry instruction chips which are sometimes more powerful\u00a0than what you currently have!<br/></p>\n<p>You are able to play a couple instructions per turn and if you have no instructions you wish to play you can end your turn. The rats also won't come after you till you get close enough and will make noise when they are on the hunt!</p>\n<p>Stuck on the map?
