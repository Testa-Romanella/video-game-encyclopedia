{"id": 115486, "slug": "triangulate-itch", "name": "Triangulate (itch)", "name_original": "Triangulate (itch)", "description": "<p>Triangulate is a virtual reality art program that enables users to fill their space with colorful triangles by pinching them out of the air using their hands with Leap Motion. After a triangle is selected (by tapping a triangle with the index finger of either hand or placing a new one by pinching somewhere), users can pinch an individual vertex and drag/release it anywhere in space to place it there. Since all shapes in 3D can be represented with triangles, any 3D surface/shape is possible to depict using this tool.<br/></p>\n<p>A colorpicker sits off to the left for coloring the selected triangle, and vertices snap to fixed points in space when the grid is activated. Users tap triangles they wish to manipulate with their index finger of either hand.</p>\n<p>A Hovercast menu (https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hover-VR-I...) on the left hand palm is used for selecting settings.</p>\n<p>This program supports Leap Motion Orion and Oculus Rift CV1. If you have that hardware and like this project, Graffiti 3D (http://graffiti3d.net) and Superstruct (http://superstruct.net) are my other VR projects that you'd probably like. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c798a3fb6bebd6b2a8e0416faa05d9e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jscottk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
