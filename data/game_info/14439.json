Every time you beat a level, the game speed increases!<br/></li><li>Time Pulse gameplay -- Slow down time and turn enemy bullets into score drops!<br/></li><li>2-Player local co-op<br/></li><li>Weekly Leaderboard!

There is only *one level*, but it keeps changing with each loop.<br/>The crazy part is, every time you beat the level, the *speed of the game* increases. It gets quite challenging by loop 5, and incredibly difficulty by loop 8.<br/><br/>To help out, there's a powerup called 'Time Pulse', in limited quantity. It slows down time temporarily, and if you shoot the enemy bullets during this time, you zap them into cash. And for every so-many bullets you destroy like this, you get a new Time Pulse! It's good to get you out of a jam, and man does it get tough later on. <br/>Once you understand the flow of the loops, you'll know when the best time to spend your Time Pulse, and you'll start to figure out how to chain them, earn more, to get further.<br/><br/>-PARKOUR!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/55529550d99bc54bc432b322f99c4356.jpg", "website": "http://www.mommysbestgames.com/gametype.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 72, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
