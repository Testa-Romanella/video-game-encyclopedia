Jump Drive immerses the player in a story unlike any other,\r\ninstead of fighting to save the universe, you already have, you just need to\r\nfind a way home and claim your fame and glory. To do this you\u2019ll leverage your\r\ntalents as the greatest pilot in the universe and fly your powerful ship The\r\nSerenity, to explore vast unknown locations in anti-space and battle giant\r\nenemies in hectic bullet hell boss fights. You will feel powerful and capable\r\nbut always on the edge, not knowing when you will find drive energy for your\r\nship or what enemy will be waiting at the other side of your next Jump.<br/><br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/RR-Games-120390056478751/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48c33722365575ce8b099ef000a05d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RRGamesAU"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
