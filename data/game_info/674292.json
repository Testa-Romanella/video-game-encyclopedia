The only options your character has outside of horizontal movement is to 'short hop' and 'laser'.  Hone your Short Hop Laser skills in training mode and then try to get a high score by surviving as long as long as you can!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut be careful,  shooting a laser while standing on the ground will have a longer animation than firing in the air. So be quick! Be accurate! and don't forget to fast fall!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T03:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b5193179ff06cd3e7f1e27b899b93a02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The420Falco"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The420Falco"], "esrb_rating": null}
