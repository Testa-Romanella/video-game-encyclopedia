From Blacksmithing and Woodworking to Painting and Sculpting, you will be able to utilise 80+ new Materials spread across Metals, Woods, Stones, Jewels, Pigments, and general Materials to create magical items that fulfill the weird or wonderful Ideas you come up with or to complete Commissions for a little extra Silver.</p>\n<p>On top of this there are dozens of new Tools and special Masterpieces that can be completed to obtain very special rewards such as a Animal Golem or a Soul Bound Wand.</p>\n<p>But that's not all as this expansion also introduces The Artificer, an enterprising creator who sees your new hobby as a challenge and whose automatons make Foraging a nightmare with their industrious harvesting.
