I was also not able to make a WebGL build because of this same issue.)</p>\n<p>2: I redesigned the level layouts\u00a0</p>\n<p>3: I changed the game music to a track made in garageband</p>\n<p>P.S\u00a0I somehow got unity to work on my MacBook! I had messaged unity a while ago and they finally got back to me, and something they told me to do fixed the problem! Unfortunately, the Plastic SCM had a few complications with the input manager that I wasn't able to figure out so I just redid the project entirely. I would have been more detailed with the final project but all of this added up to not having enough time. Just wanted to let you know!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made By Rachel Flatley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9dcb5d0106324001f9b6a1dbaacfef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flatleyr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
