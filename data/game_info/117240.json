Lots of food. \r\n\t<em>The one thing you aren't doing is eating it.</em></p><p>\r\n\tYou get to do lots of cool things!</p><ul>\n<li>Take control of a bunch of people trying to take over a cafeteria!</li> <li>Defend your people from the other bunches of people trying to do the same!</li> <li>Wear everyone down by bombarding them with vegetables!</li> <li>Get completely covered in vegetables yourself!</li> <li><em><strong>ARGH SOMEONE THREW A TOMATO AT MY FACE AND NOW I CAN'T SEE HELP HELP</strong></em></li></ul><p>\r\n\tSo how do you get into this?</p><p>\n<strong>Step 1 (optional): Watch video.</strong></p><p>\n<strong>Step 2: Download.</strong> If you're scared of downloading things, try the web demo. (a bit outdated, the AI in the downloadable version is better) And then download this game. Because it's awesome.</p><p>Of course, if you're like me and you like building things from source, there's some source code in the zip, and there's also a repository on GitHub here:</p><p>https://github.com/fanzyflani/parsniptheory</p><p>\n<strong>Step 3: Unzip it, read the README.txt file, grab a friend or 3, and run it.</strong> <em>Because awesomeness needs to be shared.</em></p><p>\n<strong>Step 4: Make videos and/or tell people about it.</strong> I don't do DMCA takedowns for people doing LPs and reviews and whatnot, so go ahead!</p><p>\r\n\tChanges:</p><p>Alpha 12:</p><ul><li>Actually included the Lua AI. Really sorry about this, guys!</li><li><strong>Open source release.</strong> The Linux builds are from Alpha 11, but functionally identical to the Alpha 12 builds. And you get the Lua AI in this zip, too!</li></ul><p>Alpha 11:</p><ul><li>Added support for Lua-based AIs (if the Lua AI gets an error, it reverts to the C AI)</li><li>Ported the C AI behaviour to Lua... and added crouching to it!</li><li>Changed the table tile to something that looks less like a vent</li></ul><p>Alpha 10b:</p><ul>\n<li>Fixed a crash bug when you action-click an empty tile with no player selected.</li></ul><p>Alpha 10a:</p><ul><li>Fixed said obnoxious crash bug</li><li>Added fullscreen support!</li><li>Updated sackit (music playroutine) to the latest version - music now mixed at 48000Hz</li></ul><p>Alpha 10:</p><p>Note, the Windows build is actually Alpha 9. I needed to fix a crash bug in the Windows version, and at the time I just wanted to push this update so Raspi users can play w/o crashes.</p><ul>\n<li>Added a simple graphics setup screen</li><li>Added optimised 1x-through-5x scalers</li><li>Raspberry Pi build actually works again!</li><li>Raspi: Added a faster mixer to the music playroutine</li><li>Music playback may be a little bit less likely to crash now</li></ul><p>Alpha 9:</p><ul><li>Network version bump - not mentioned in the changelog, but IS in the readme this time! Either way, you SHOULD be using the latest version at all times! (Except when I say something's broken.)</li><li>GAMEPLAY CHANGE: Added in crouch/stand mechanic. Now you can hide behind tables!</li><li>Added in a title screen - please let me know if I need to punch Windows in the face repeatedly to make it not crash!</li><li>Added in some artwork which should eventually be polished up and used in a title sequence.</li><li>Fixed a bug where more than one unit could move at once</li><li>Fixed a bug where the AI could end turn before fully finishing, breaking other players (enforced a 1/4 second delay after last move before turn end available)</li><li>Fixed a rendering bug which made the level editor unusable, which probably fixed some other things too</li></ul><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Builds earlier than Alpha 12 do not include source.
