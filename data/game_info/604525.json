Blue boxes are flying around to make your life harder - each of them will remap your controls in different ways! Can you fly with an axis inverted? What about both? What if left is up, and up is down? The more your controls are scrambled, the higher the multiplier on your score goes! Compare your results with scores from all across the world!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>In the main menu, type your nickname after \"Welcome\" so that it will be used to store your scores, then click \"Play\".</p>\n<p>In game, the controls are the arrow keys or the left stick of your gamepad. As to what they will do, well... that depends!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n<p>The game was made with Godot Engine.
