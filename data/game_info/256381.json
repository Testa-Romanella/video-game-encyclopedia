They have taken over the city streets and highways in what can only be called the apocalypse.  The police are gone so scientists have created Dinosaur mutants to rescue civilians and defend the city.  These Dinosaurs are perfect creatures for fighting these walking undead Zombies. They are resistant to fire, they can run fast, they can turn the zombies to blood, and they are capable of mass destruction themselves.  However, the scientists have placed a special microchip in the Trex brain that allows you to control the beast.  Run through the city and complete the missions before time runs out.  Or, you may decide the free play version which allows you to run around and attack as many zombies as possible.
