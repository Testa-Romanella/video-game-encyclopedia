It's easy to play, and it's good for people in love. The goal of this simple game is to connect two matching ICONS using three or fewer lines. This means that you must be able to connect two matches to a row that is no longer matched, without being blocked by another icon. In all the icon objects at each level, you have enough time to complete the task. You can also get an integral for the remaining time at the end of each level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b38badbd36b203295a44523f835ac35_LRVDpND.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zhijun Huang"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Zhijun Huang"], "esrb_rating": null}
