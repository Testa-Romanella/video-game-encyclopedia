The agreement spans an initial 50 years with the possibility of a second 50 years. The initial phase of construction began in December 2014 and the target year of completion is 2020. The agreement to this 40-50 billion US dollar project was discussed by the Nicaraguan National Assembly for only one week before approval. The agreement was not made public prior to the decision. The construction of the Nicaraguan Canal would entail the largest movement of earth in the planet's history and would have immense ecological impact. The planned route of the canal would require the forced relocation of campesino communities.</p><p>To help bring attention to the Nicaraguan Canal, the video game \"Ometepe\" is set on the island of the same name, located in Lake Nicaragua through which the canal will pass (Ometepe has been a key site of protest). Although the project appears to be stopped due to lack of funds, the Nicaraguan government remains secretive about the project.</p><p>The game stars El Chapulin Colorado (the Red Cricket) who protects the island from the Nicaraguan Dictator Daniel Ortega and Hong Kong Billionaire Wang Jing.</p><p>M\u00e1s \u00e1gil que una tortuga, m\u00e1s fuerte que un rat\u00f3n, m\u00e1s noble que una lechuga, su escudo es un coraz\u00f3n... \u00a1Es el Chapul\u00edn Colorado! (More agile than a turtle, stronger than a mouse, nobler than a lettuce, his coat of arms is a heart... It's the Red Grasshopper!) El Chapulin Colorado (the Red Grasshoper) is a comic super hero from the longest running Mexican television variety show titled Chespirito. Created by Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os (Chespirito) is a parodied superhero that usually captures the bad guy through error rather than intention.<br/></p><p>Daniel Ortega, president of Nicaragua has manipulated the constitution through the Sandinista party to get himself re-elected as president and then to abolish term limits. The Canal may be little more than a ploy for an influx of capital for him to maintain the presidency. Ortega has effectively re-established a dictatorship in Nicaragua.<br/></p><p>Wang Jing, Hong Kong billionaire that is financing the development of the Nicaraguan Canal as president of the Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Corporation or HKND. Wang Jing is Chairman and CEO of Beijing Xinwei, a Chinese telecoms company. According to Forbes, as of November 2015 his net worth is 3.3 billion.<br/></p><p>The lungless salamander (Bolitoglossa insularis) is extremely rare as it is only found in the cloud forest of the Maderas Volcano on the island of Ometepe. As the game shares the name of the island Ometepe that is formed by two volcanoes rising from Lake Nicaragua that are linked by low wetlands, the game features this creature unique to Ometepe as well as the sounds of the mantled howler monkey. Ometepe Island was officially declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2010. <a href=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/species/7236\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the bolitoglossa insularis<br/></a></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a13c15f48a167f30212494d267db13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ricardo Miranda Zuniga"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
