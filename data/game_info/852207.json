The bottom of your shoes to the impact of your fly swatter, humanity cringes in disgust when the big one is on the wall 10 centimeters from your face. What we never seemed to ask was...how does the spider feel? Does it want to get mutilated by your steel toes? Well fear not, my friends, in this totally AAA quality game, we'll take a step in the legs of our disgusting arachnids.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>On a more serious note, this is my first ever project as a rookie programmer, so definitely leave any comments below that kill my self confidence and dignity.
