I was also planning to do 3 other classes but had no where near enough time to implement them (mostly from my inexperience lol).</p>\n<p>Also, you can walk off of the screen. That was something I was planning on adding near the end but never got time.</p>\n<p>Thanks to anyone who plays, I really enjoyed making it (wish i had enough time to finish it tho)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b687c2074c3678b27270ffff2c425cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SharpyC"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
