Please keep in mind that this is my first game development experience ever. I had no idea of Lua coding, 2D Art, 3D Art and soundcreation and did all on my own and from scratch. I played around with programms like Gimp or Visual Studio before but nothing serious. I learned so much during this production process and I believe I can create something epic in the future. I thank all of you who support me. I will spend earned money for assets, production equipment, like a graphic tablet or tools for creating games.</p>\n<p>Have fun :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mad Morra Productions</strong><strong> </strong><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f7431913aed44062880fcf66134af87c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phodex Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
