Early access will release in 3/11/21 and there is no date yet for a Full Release (I work at my own pace without deadlines). The title ideology is that there is no clear explenation (at least for me) that if Doom is a 16 bit game or a 32 bit game. So I take the number between 16 and 32 and put it in the title replacing the \"64\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/80056e360ff201acf4f9e3801044a011.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DJCraneJR"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
