The goal is to send a space shuttle to the International Space Station. Your tasks will be, among others:<br/>\u2022\tTo crush mountains,<br/>\u2022\tTo move tons of earth,<br/>\u2022\tTo cut metal constructions<br/>\u2022\tTo mine radioactive ores,<br/>\u2022\tAnd to transport (rock, ore, machines\u2026 and even a space shuttle!!)<br/><br/>Our machines have the following features:<br/>\u2022\tAccurately recreated cockpits and models,<br/>\u2022\tCompletely analog controls of actuators and cranes,<br/>\u2022\tFull physics simulation (no cutting corners!).<br/><br/>Your campaign takes place in 6 different geographical localizations: Greenland, Canada, Wyoming, Missouri and Florida. Thanks to a detailed depiction of the machines, you will be able to appreciate the magnitude of those beasts (compared to a human, a car and buildings placed on the map). You can also explore the machine in first person perspective; the wide view from the cockpit will immerse you in the world of really heavy machinery.<br/><br/>An alternate gameplay mode is Time Attack. It is unlocked after you complete the story mode (campaign), and is comprised of selected missions. The rewards for completing a mission in a set time are bronze, silver and gold medals, and your entry into the high scores.<br/><br/>Your hunger for knowledge will be satiated by the Machine Library. This small encyclopedia with 3D models will broaden your knowledge of the biggest machines man has ever built.
