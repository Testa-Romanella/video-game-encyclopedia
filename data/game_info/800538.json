It'll be on YouTube soon.</strong>\n</li><li>FAQ: How many endings are there?\u00a0<strong>A: 6. 2 for Normal Mode. 2 for Hard Mode. 2 for Monday Mode.</strong>\n</li><li>FAQ: Monday Mode seems impossible.<strong>\u00a0A: That's not a question. And yea, it is. I can't beat the game on Monday, that's for sure.</strong>\n</li><li><strong>TIP:</strong>\u00a0Praying sometimes summons a rare Pasta Fairy! Try doing some PRAYS early, and if you're lucky, maybe you can stockpile some healing items!\r\n</li><li><strong>TIP:</strong>\u00a0Sansfield inflicts poison/karma damage when he hits you. This is displayed as purple health and slowly ticks down. Items cure poison/karma and THEN heal you! So healing quickly means you can recover more hp!\r\n</li><li><strong>TIP:</strong>\u00a0When Sansfield is sleeping, he prefers to not be disturbed.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Feel free to use this artwork from the game for YouTube Thumbnails/articles, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/521109902259b6461b1119085e43f2e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lumpy", "Spasco"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
