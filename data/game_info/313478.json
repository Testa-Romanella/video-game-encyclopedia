Treasure-filled <strong>trash bags</strong>; glimmering <strong>glass bottles</strong>\u00a0and cozy, <strong>moldy couches</strong>.\u00a0 But what do you do with all that?\u00a0 How can this likable litter become great again. Become what's in again. Become<strong>\u00a0that</strong> again.</p>\n<p>Introducing:<strong><em> Litter Bay<strong>\u2122</strong></em>,\u00a0</strong>a <em>Yucky Junk Jet Games</em> initiative.</p>\n<p><em>Litter Bay\u00a0</em>is our take on heavenly fun on earth, and the latest in our line of recreational services. Use the latest, patent pending de-littering drone tech\u00a0to clear a tricky\u00a0 track in the water to challenge your best frienemy to jet-ski through, all while they do the same for you!<br/></p>\n<p>Will you be the one winning a certified <strong>Litter Trophy Supreme</strong>?</p>\r\nThe Litter Bay Sports Game\r\n<p>Our formidable game is divided into two phases. First phase is the <strong>Litter Clean-Out Phase:\u00a0</strong>This phase is all about cleaning up trash from the water, making a difficult route for your adversary to the <strong>Victory Buoy</strong> placed in the center of the bay. However, this is not a pointless round - being the first at the goal will gain you points steadily until your opponent arrive as well.<strong> Be strategic!</strong></p>\n<p>The second phase is the <strong>Trace Race</strong>, where you speed through the area again, but this time on your jet-ski following the route laid out by your opponent. Similarly, the first player at the goal will receive points until the other player's arrival. <strong>Be fast!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Let the games begin!</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: Works best at 1920x1080 resolution</strong></p>\r\nThe Controls\r\n<p>The game can be played on the keyboard or using two controllers. Controls are the same across both phases, however handing is different from each other.</p>\n<p><strong>In phase 1:</strong> The drone can either move forward or turn, but not both at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>In phase 2:</strong> The jet-ski can turn and move at the same time.</p>\n\n<br/>Keyboard<em>Turn counter clock-wise</em>Left Arrow<em>Turn clock-wise</em>Right Arrow<em>Move forward</em>Up Arrow\r\n\n<strong>Keyboard</strong><br/>A<em>Turn counter clock-wise</em>D<em>Turn clock-wise</em>W<em>Move forward</em>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>This game has been developed by\u00a0<em>Yucky Junk Jet Games</em>\u00a0for the Nordic Game Jam 2019.
