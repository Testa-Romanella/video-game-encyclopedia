{"id": 624868, "slug": "allein", "name": "Allein", "name_original": "Allein", "description": "STILL IN DEVELOPMENT (BETA)\r\nAbout:\r\n<p>Allein is a short, turn-based RPG set in a fantasy world. You choose one of five characters to lead your party as you explore the world and discover your place. With light narrative and some player choice Allein is game-play and exploration driven. If you enjoy turn-based games or want an old-but-new RPG experience you can complete without hundreds of hours invested give it a try!<br/></p>\r\nConcept:\r\n<p>If you have a love for classic turn-based rpg games you'll know many of the classics by now. Allein tries to create a traditional turn based game with less traditional exploration and more interesting character growth &amp; combat. Allein is non-linear and the enemy AI has conditions to the actions instead of random dice rolls. Bosses in particular will challenge your ability to recognize and respond to these patterns and conditions. You'll find light puzzles, secret areas, and combat strategy to keep you engaged as you work your way through the game. While all of these exist, none of them should be too time consuming and a full play through should be doable in a single day - even first time.<br/></p>\r\nFree:\r\n<p>This project is free, if you find it re-uploaded or were told to pay for it please contact me. It is my first time making something like this and I only want\u00a0 others to enjoy it. I have allowed you to donate on the download, but know that 100% of that money will go to the character artist and/or towards making this and my future games better. I did not create this for a profit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a17cab5c9149909fe85d115902e57f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fengraf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
