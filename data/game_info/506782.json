This game was inspired by the game\u00a0Reigns where you have to choose to respond with one of two responses\u00a0to situations in your kingdom and the goal is to keep your power as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Here is the full story of this game:\u00a0The year is\u00a0\u00a02163 and you have been captured while trying to destroy a computer server, the computers force you to work as a slave that interprets human emotion for them by deciding between two propaganda messages that have been generated by other slaves. You use the statistics meter to see which statistics need to be raised or lowered and get alerts from the computers about specific situations happening that may impact the statistics. You work on one task every year in the story and the computers make your body semi-immortal so that you can work for them until they have no use for you. If you cause the statistics to be in humanities favor causing humanity to win then you lose as the computers kill you for betraying them, and if the statistics lead to the human race going extinct then the computers will kill you for failing your objective. And after ~23 years you get a chance to get revenge... I don't wanna spoil the end...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T07:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/407061ad524abbfc9942734c5b1f6288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Takistaks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
