But everyone is controlled by the same input, which leads them to move simultaneously. So you have to find a way to stop one, in order for the others to catch up to him. Of course it gets a bit more complex than that after a few levels ;)<br/>\r\nMany different types of characters, objects and mechanics to give you a hard time beating this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e13/e13c536739d12ca3f87d99d3e8c2cfaa.jpg", "website": "https://bytinggames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 154, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Byting Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Byting Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
