{"id": 840875, "slug": "bounce-your-bullets", "name": "Bounce your Bullets!", "name_original": "Bounce your Bullets!", "description": "- I tried to build this in 2 weeks. It might or might not have taken 2 months instead. <strong>Please expect it to be what it is and no more. You shoot bullets. Your bullets bounce and get stronger. (Full details of the content below).</strong><br/>- If you have any feedback, or find some bug or find anything misleading on the store page, please come say hi on Twitter or in the forums. (links in the sidebar). <br/><br/><br/><br/>1- you are always moving.<br/>2- you follow the mouse.<br/>3- you have to prevent enemies from reaching the other side of the screen. You have 9 \"lives\".<br/>4- they explode in debris that can only be destroyed with a projectile that is strong enough.<br/>5- if you get hit you lose (no 9 lives on that).<br/>6- your bullets get stronger every few bounces.<br/>7- the goal is just to survive for as long as possible. It gets harder and harder.<br/><br/>notes/tips :<br/>- debris don't reduce your lives if they reach the other side of the screen, but they still kill you if you touch them.<br/>- enemies pop after one hit, no matter their color.<br/>- the more bounces a bullet got, the more points it will give.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>- You must get this to shoot. It is different from the bigger yellow spheres. This one allows you to shoot bullets. The bigger yellow spheres kill you. Don't ask. You will be fine.<br/><br/><br/>Red (triangles) bullets. They spawn side yellow bullets when they hit something.<br/>After a few bounces they become green.<br/><br/><br/>Green (squares) : goes fast. This is strong because it almost guarantees the bullet will hit enough things to upgrade into the next one :<br/><br/><br/>Purple (pentagons) : spawns a lot of basic yellow bullets. These little ones will slow down but if they upgrade into red bullets they will perform normally. The main bullet will upgrade into the final evolution after enough bounces :<br/><br/><br/>Black/white (hexagons) : Spawns a shockwave after a small amount of time. It will clear the screen from debris and pop all enemies.<br/><br/>note/tips : <br/>- shapes in debris are deactivated by default.<br/>- bullets have a lifetime.<br/><strong>- If you were randomly scrolling through, this is the part where you learn that you only shoot yellow bullets (and they then upgrade by bouncing). </strong><br/><br/>On top of that there are different \"weapon types\" that you can unlock and choose from in the menu.<br/>1- <strong>\"Simple shot\"</strong>. This is what you get at first. Just shoots bullets one by one. You can upgrade it so that it shoots 3 bullets successively.<br/>2- <strong>\"Tri-shot\"</strong> : spawns 3 bullets at once. You can upgrade it so that it shoots 5 bullets at once. Penta-shot I guess.<br/>3- <strong>\"Full auto\"</strong>. Might or might not be dependent on your framerate, as a feature, totally.<br/><br/>- You also have an upgrade to double your turn speed. This becomes useful as the game progresses and you have to dodge debris or quickly change direction.<br/><br/><br/>- Your ship (let's call that a ship) follows your mouse cursor.<br/>- Left click to shoot.<br/>- There are no other control you just click.<br/><br/><br/>- You can add shapes to debris if you are colorblind. This is the case in the gifs above in the content session.<br/>- You can also remove shapes from everything. This was the original design. But in the end it makes more sense to still have them in most places by default.<br/>- The game is made to be played one-handed.<br/><br/><br/>- As some of you might have guessed if you are a fine connoisseur of dancing mice, some music is from Kevin MacLeod.
