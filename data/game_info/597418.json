(such as choosing from base moves of all the pieces and some of them start with abilities)</p>\n<p>More color pallets unlocked from playing, some will keep the pop art style while some will be completely different.</p>\n<p>Bugs -</p>\n<p>Pieces moving without being able to move like that (bishop moving horizontally)</p>\n<p>Being able to move in same spot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T03:56:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45f949be2dc5ba88dcc52442e43fa96b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["machinodude"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
