It plays like a familiar top-down-shooter but your flashlight is your only view into the darkness - oh and your 6th sense... Resources are scarce and even the furniture could be trying to kill you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Note from Roarke (the developer):</strong><br/>Heartless Dark was designed as a 'coffee-break roguelike' - easy to pick up and put down and not hugely demanding of your time. A run could be completed in around 20 minutes if you're good enough. While it may not contain thousands of item combinations, hundreds of enemies and complex meta-progression like other games in the genre, I've still put my passion into creating a unique, atmospheric and replay-able experience.<br/><br/><strong>Action-Roguelike:</strong> <strong>Shoot</strong>, <strong>dodge</strong>, <strong>stun</strong>, <strong>electrocute</strong>, <strong>throw bombs</strong> and <strong>other tools</strong> as you kill monsters in abandoned corporate offices. Expect <strong>procedural levels</strong>, <strong>stats</strong>, <strong>upgrades</strong>, <strong>synergies</strong>, <strong>multiple characters </strong> and <strong>perma-death</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Oppressive Darkness:</strong> Your <strong>flashlight</strong> is your only view into the <strong>darkness</strong> all around you. Oh and your <strong>6th sense</strong>...<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Survival Horror:</strong> Your survival relies on <strong>spatial awareness</strong>, managing your <strong>limited resources</strong> and learning to use <strong>hazards</strong> to your advantage.<h3>FEATURES</h3><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/><ul><li>Randomly generated corporate office levels<br/></li><li> Perma-death<br/></li><li> Environmental hazards<br/></li><li> Stats, upgrades, items and synergies<br/></li><li> Multiple playable characters (including randomized)<br/></li><li> Discoverable lore<br/></li><li> Possessed furniture that might try to kill you</li></ul><strong>QUALITY OF LIFE: </strong><br/><ul><li> Seed system<br/></li><li> Controller support<br/></li><li> Customizable difficulty</li></ul><strong>DOES NOT FEATURE:</strong><br/><ul><li> Loot boxes or micro-transactions<br/></li><li> Complex meta-progression<br/></li><li> Dialogue<br/></li><li> Skill Trees<br/></li><li> Multiplayer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T03:45:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2aded97f4d4e9cd601f31016634852e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iamRoarke"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["iamRoarke"], "esrb_rating": null}
