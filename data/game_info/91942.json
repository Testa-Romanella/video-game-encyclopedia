Play as a tiny robot named Blitz, and escape the factory where it seems everything is trying to break you.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe gameplay is as simple as it is satisfying. Blitz can only jump, and perform an air dash in one of 4 directions. Upon colliding with an object that doesn't break you, you are free to dash again. Use this to navigate the challenges ahead and reach the portal at the end of the stage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tPlease send all comments/inquires/bugs to bonchogames@gmail.com\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFollow @blekdar (main developer)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWanna know about future platform news, such as iOS, Android and Xbox One?
