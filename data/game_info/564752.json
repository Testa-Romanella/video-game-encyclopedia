If you would like to actually enjoy the game, do not go through the gray barrier until they disappear once you complete the level.</p>\n<p>Welcome secret agent Otto the Octopus! We are glad to have your services. You will be infiltrating the lair of Dr. Kraken today and stopping his evil plans to remove the spines of every animal on the planet.</p>\n<p>Beware, his agents are invisible so\u00a0I have fitted your heart with a device that should allow you to briefly see them. Was open heart surgery an invasion of privacy? Sure, but you have three of them!</p>\n<p>I need you to last 2 minutes in each part of the lair so I have time to activate the teleporters to the deeper parts of the lair. I'll be communicating via a transponder in your other heart. Don't worry this shouldn't affect your heartrate at all...probably.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play: </strong>Use the WASD or ARROW KEYS on your keyboard or the LEFT STICK on a gamepad to move across Kraken\u2019s lair and use the MOUSE or the RIGHT STICK on your gamepad to aim your shots!</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for spare bombs dropped by enemy agents! Drop bombs with the \u201cE\u201d button on your keyboard or the RIGHT BUMPER on your gamepad!</p>\n<p>You can also activate your inviso-watch with the \u201cQ\u201d button on your keyboard or the LEFT BUMPER on your gamepad to turn INVISIBLE for short bursts but remember, after a while, you\u2019ll have to let it recharge!</p>\n<p>Here's a low down on Dr. Kraken's henchmen:</p>\n<p><strong>Bat</strong> - fast little critters, but low health</p>\n<p><strong>Snake</strong> - Slow, but will shoot venom and can see you when you're invisible</p>\n<p><strong>Crab</strong> - a brutish thug that can summon typhoons thanks to Dr. Kraken's evil genius, or maybe just a coincidence\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Music by StoreBoughtFood</p>\n<p>Coding and Visuals by BroReNata</p>\n<p>Special assistance and meme support by TheSapphireWolf</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>Built with Godot, art with Aseprite, music with Beepbox, sound effects with jfxr</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong></p>\n<p>Bat\u00a0modified from Elthen</p>\n<p>Typhoon\u00a0from pimen</p>\n<p>Font\u00a0from datagoblin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T10:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d628bddcd616f92cda4bd47cad812847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["BroReNata"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
