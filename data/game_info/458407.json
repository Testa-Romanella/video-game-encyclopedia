So we invented a game with Sitro as the main character</p>\n\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>Sitro belongs to a very special species, it is a lively lime with an extraordinarily good taste. He is the last of his kind since humans love them and he is trying to escape from one of them. Despite of all the obstacles he can encounter, he always manages to escape and survive but he can't live like that!\u00a0So he decides to fight against this human who won't let him go!</p>\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls for playing the game are very simple. The player will have to move with the Q and D keys (azerty keyboard). The player can also jump with the space bar and interact with objects with the E key. And later in the adventure you will discover that there will be another key which is the left click of the mouse.</p>\n\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Pierre Arvis - Programmer</p>\n<p>Damien Leclercq - Game Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79df56ea33b83f324bbf431785e8683e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damien Leclercq"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
