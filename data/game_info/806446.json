There is a small, basic course set up for automating the mine production.</p>\n<p>NB. The Seed/Fert/Lime Fill point is in an extremely awkward position so that can only be used as a 'send to' point and then manoeuvre yourself from there.</p>\n<p>NB. The Animal Dealer (We Buy Hay) sell point can't unload automatically. Will need to send and then unload manually.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you find anything wrong or doesn't work and I will try and get a fix done and new version uploaded.</p>\n<p>Please use the comments section or you can find me on Discord @\u00a0https://discord.gg/aQNvR5G6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T22:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fed518da7730c319cdb0758a84f6a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Farmer_Ed_Gaming"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
