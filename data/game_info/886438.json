Pressing select or reset during your game will interrupt your game without prompting - so be careful!</p>\n\n<p>When the game starts, press Select to choose a level and press fire to start the level. This game does not support pausing, saving or progressive spawn points, since Atari 2600 games did not support those options. This is a sidescrolling platformer, so the Unicorn will move without any input from you. Flying consumes mana, so you'll need to collect the red mana apples you find in the world to power your flight. Use the up and down to fly or return to earth. Forward and back will speed or slow your movement. Press space to shoot at the trolls and witches and stay out of the water!<br/></p>\n<p>For an extra bit of nostalgia for Atari games, press 'F' to enable CRT mode during any level.</p><p>This game uses 100% new game code and was developed in Godot.
