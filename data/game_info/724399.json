{"id": 724399, "slug": "hybrid-soft-shadow-renderer", "name": "Hybrid Soft Shadow Renderer", "name_original": "Hybrid Soft Shadow Renderer", "description": "<p>This was designed and built by Lewis Bond.</p>\n<p>portfolio: https://lbondi7.github.io/</p>\n<p>This is a hybrid soft shadow renderer. It uses percentage closer soft shadows (pcss) shadow mapping and Vulkan ray query to render more realistic shadows at a higher frame rate. It also makes use of an adaptive performance system based on the difference between the current frame rate and the target frame rate to maintain a more stable frame rate. A sigmoid function is also used to blend between the shadow mapping and ray query.</p>\n<p>It does require a graphics card with RTX cores, so if your graphics card doesn't have any RTX cores, then it will just perform the PCSS shadow mapping.</p>\n<p>If you can't run it and it comes up with an error saying xxxxxx.dll isn't installed or it can't find it then follow the link below. It has the latest Microsoft visual c++ redistributables which are needed to run a c++ <br/>application in windows. Download the x64 version as this build is only for x64 systems.</p>\n<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msv...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:45:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9dae1633cdcff3e5e82de845d722b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lbondi7"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
