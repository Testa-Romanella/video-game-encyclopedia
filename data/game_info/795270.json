Your hunger bar drops by two points every one minute and to get it back you have to go to a food source that would be your fridge or a hot dog stand near where you are. To get to your gym you have to leave your house, obviously, the more you work out the more your muscle bar and the lower your stamina bar, to recover your stamina bar you just walk to your room and sleep.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T16:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/1349de5873c62645c42842657c0aa038.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LionMarfs11"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
