Tiles are numbered from 1 to n, so one possible arrangement is that of increasing order from the top-left to the bottom-right, leaving the last square on the board empty. This is the final state. The player starts with a random arrangement of tiles and must slide tiles around the grid to reach the final state.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea03c2b240e439c141e23d843b8b27fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gsettanta"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
