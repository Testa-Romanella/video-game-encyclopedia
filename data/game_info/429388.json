I quickly realized... \"I can whip up some trash like this\" So I did. In three days I made this game. It was a good quick start, and I'm planning on making Under Fire 2 with better looking assets, and some simple upgrades, like adding a choice of different crosshairs, improving enemy AI, adding simple achievements, etc.</p>\n<p>Basically I was going for that feeling you get when you play one of those shitty games off those 1000 Games! disc. I used to play those really REALLY bad games with an indescribable feeling of cheesy entertainment. I guess I just always looked at those games and was like, dude, I could totally do that. But this time I actually did.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to support further development, you can download the Windows \u00a0copy for a measly $2. I'd love to devote much more time to creating my own gems that inspire others one day to do the same.</p>\n<p>https://invadetech.itch.io/under-fire</p>\n<p>I'll be making other types of games for you guys soon. Actual feedback on what parts were fun and what things you would change or like to see included in later releases would really help and be appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d73c5f4928eae29e90e5c6be6f159e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Invade Tech Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
