Use the arrow keys to move and uncover adjacent tiles, and click on the board\u00a0to set flags. You can cycle a tile's flag\u00a0between orange and white.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0found that a fun way to play this version is to see how few tiles you can uncover and still make it to the other side. The white flag option is especially useful for that challenge.</p>\n<p>My first published game made in vanilla HTML and JS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06b54446260d01a2966a9f6c044630b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isaac Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
