The E is your cursor, whenever you hit the crystal it makes a 180 turn, although sometimes you might keep hitting it and get it caught inside you. If that happens, just move out of the way quickly, it'll come off of you. Also, to start the game you need to click the flag and then\u00a0press your spacebar. You may need to hit it twice, but it'll eventually go. To reset, you need to refresh the page and do the spacebar thing again.\u00a0I promise this game works. x) If you wanna learn some story, continue reading. If you don't, well, have fun!</strong>\n\n\n\n<strong>Oh noo! You lost your prized Crystal in the center of some horses! You must keep it away from the horses!

So this is how they do it... Whatever, do me a favor and don't play this game. It's a trap set up by the horses so they can capture people.\u00a0I can't get into the details right now, I don't have much time, but my name is Edd. Just please don't play this game. Trust me. Save us. Don't let us be captured like so many others have. We're real people, just like you. We had lives. These horses took them.
