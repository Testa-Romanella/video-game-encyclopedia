I'm working on this game for 3 - 4 months I don't know. Game has first world and few levels already. It has some lacks for example narrator that will comment how you play, music and sounds are also missing.</p>\n<p>I will try push new update in every few days. I hope you will enjoy The Slime Adventure and plz don't play The Lonely Slime Adventure\u00a0 it's kinda trash.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T05:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df6681fb0bf57c8c4b2fd7abba7777d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CourierGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
