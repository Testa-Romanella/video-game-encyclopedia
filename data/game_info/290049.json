Touch Hockey 2 has been out for a bit, and builds upon the great original while maintaining all of the aspects that made the original great. First and foremost, there are outstanding controls so that it\u2019s the closest thing to playing air hockey without having a paddle in hand at the arcade. The sequel focuses on the 3D engine which allows for more play area as compared to a simple top down version with the table taking up the size of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T18:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f393fdebeecf3e905b11d8051bf00ba7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["FlipSide Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
