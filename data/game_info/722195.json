Think ahead and have fun!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>- GAME INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created for the -2022 January-\u00a0Juice Jam.</p>\n<p>The entire project took about 7 days to make, and although my initial plans for the game were much larger and more refined, I'm quite happy with the overall finished product in light of the fact that my schedule was packed this week, and I was running on 5-6 hours of sleep a day ;)</p>\n<p>I want to say that although the art style was created very quickly, I'm decently happy with the odd but interesting theme it provides. (Also, yes.\u00a0 It was originally inspired from Downwell's simplistic grayscale pixel art :)</p>\n<p>Please leave feedback on which parts of the game you liked, and which parts seem to be lacking.\u00a0 Although there's a lot I'd change given more time, a vital part of my growth as a game developer is feedback from others.</p>\n<p>Also, credit to Tim Day for the amazing soundtrack!</p>\n<p>With all that said, enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d66/d66c61c18bf3b94063fee5a771b936b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Queble"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
