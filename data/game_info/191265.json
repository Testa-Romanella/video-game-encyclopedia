The current version might not work if your system has the latest version of Java (see RANTY\u00a0TECHNICAL SIDENOTE below), but I'm hoping to fix that soon.</p>\n<p>This game is basically finished for the moment, save for polishing and bugfixes. I might return to it when I'm better at gameplay and graphics.</p>\n<p>RANTY TECHNICAL SIDENOTE</p>\n<p>This project is written in Clojure/Clojurescript and compiled to different versions for the browser and various operating systems, kind of like Unity. For Windows, Mac, and Linux, it runs on the JVM. Annoyingly, the tools I used aren't fully updated to use the last version of Java, 10, without crashing. I think the problem is mostly with the Quil library rather than Clojure itself.</p>\n<p>I'm working to release a version of the game bundled with Java 8 so it works on all platforms. (Java 9 isn't supported anymore.)</p>\n<p>Also annoyingly, Java version numbers are written in multiple ways, so Java 8 is equivalent to Java 1.8 and Java 9 is equivalent to Java 1.9.</p>\n<p>In case you're a Clojure developer using Quil who's stumbled upon this,\u00a0I recommend using jENV to use Java 8 with Clojure.\u00a0I'm planning to use javapackager to create the installers and packages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47f/47f9d5115e81ccb3e361e4dfe6343cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["actuallyalys"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
