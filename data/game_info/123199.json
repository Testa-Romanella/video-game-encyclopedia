I RECOMMEND PLAYING THE DOWNLOAD VERSION OF SNEAK - THE HTML5 VERSION IS ONLY EXPERIMENTAL<br/></p><p>Sneak has two modes, a puzzle mode and the classic snake mode. In puzzle mode you have to manage your snakelength aswell as fight enemies and avoid getting hit. Find keycards to open the door to the next stage. You can use \"think\" in the menu or press select to pause the action and think about your next move.</p><p>The classic mode is the usual snake fun without any weapons. Just try to survive and achieve the highest score possible.</p><p>I had much fun doing this game for the GBJam 5 and i would flesh it outif you find it interesting enough. So hit me up on twitter and tell me what you think, should there be a sequel?
