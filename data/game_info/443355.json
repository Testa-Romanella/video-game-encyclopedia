You can scan the objects with a tablet, to aquire knowledge about them, grab them to observe them more closely... and smash them.</p>\n<p>This project explores the concept of sacredness and cultural heritage. What does it feel like to go against these rules we were taught our whole lives ?</p>\n\n\n<p>This experience requires a VR headset !
