In this unit we had to role-play as an indie studio and pitch a game around a certain historical figure and setting. We would appreciate any feedback on our work.)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It's 1937 and Amelia Earhart is attempting for the second time to become first person to circle the globe. Accompanied by her navigator for this attempt Fred Noonan she is on course to arrive at Howland Island the next stop in her journey when suddenly her plane is struck down by lighting and she is forced to make a crash landing on a nearby island.\u00a0 Now finding herself standard on an island whose Jurassic habitat has been persevered by the psychic powers of the parasitic lifeform that rules over the island. Earhart joins forces with a rouge member of the hive-mind that she calls 'Robin' who transforms her plane 'The Canary' into a car that they can use to rescue Noonan who has been kidnaped by psychic dinosaurs in order to the become of the host of the island's hivemind.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Game-Play and Controls.</strong><br/><br/>Take control of the refashioned 'Canary' and dodge the obstacles in your path to score points but be careful each obstacle that you hit will subtract points from you score. Can you get the highest rank?\u00a0</p>\n<p>press the left arrow key to swerve into the closet 'lane' on your the left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press the right arrow key to swerve into the closet 'lane' on your right.<br/></p>\n<p>Press the bottom arrow key to use the power of robin to temporality teleport a small distance behind yourself.\u00a0 Once the teleportation is over you will teleport forwards to your previous position on the x-axis and the teleportation indicator on the right will darken preventing you from performing this action again. However once this ability is ready for use again the indicator will light up\u00a0 and at this moment a sound will play.</p>\n<p>After the level is complete you will be taken to a 'results screen' where you will be graded on your performance either receiving an A, B or C grade. After this the credits will play and you will then need to close the game manually. However you can avoid this the next time you play by pressing the escape key once you are in the results screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes.</strong></p>\n<p>(They are two things that you should note before playing this game. Firstly due to the requirements of this unit each member of the group was required to make a level and as such each of the demo's levels are contained within different exe files. Secondly it should also be noted that the value in the right hand corner of the hud is a development tool that was meant to be removed during production but was forget about and such it has no use to the player.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/99879ae747b093d05cf984207e95032a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Headless Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
