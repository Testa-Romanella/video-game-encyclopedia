The catch would be that every 3rd item would make you grow. Because of the level layout only certain items would be accessible to small/medium/large size player. If you don't get the items in the correct order you might lock yourself out of getting all 10 to 100% the board. The level would be timed as well to give a replay ability.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>-Credits-</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>Programming: Me</p>\n<p>Art :Kenney (Kenney)</p>\n<p>Music Music: Good Morning Doctor Weird - Eric Matyas (SoundImage)</p>\n<p>Jump SFX: Swing Whoosh - Jofae (PixaBay)</p>\n<p>Chew SFX: Chew - 666HeroHero (PixaBay)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T09:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f45551de3346b6513a1c53056099e66a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dingofar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
