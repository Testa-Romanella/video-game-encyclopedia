Players jump around and attack each other with their main weapon, the plasma rifle. Another powerful tool in their arsenal is their beam. The beam can be used to launch the player into the air using fixed hooks or to grab power-ups and items. There are also thirty power-ups that are shuffled randomly and can be picked up throughout each course.
