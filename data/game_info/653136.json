I am new to unreal engine so I learned along with creating it, Hope you like it.</p>\n<p>Note :- I am a beginner so there might be some bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play :-</strong></p>\n<p>It's a two player \"last man standing wins\" game where you win by surviving till last. There are 100 tiles for player to walk on, once you step on a tile it becomes red and if you step on any red tile then it collapses along with any other adjacent red tiles near it. But there is a very short time duration before red tiles start falling hence a player can quickly move to a non-red tile during that time. If a player steps in the area/hole where a red has already fallen then he falls and looses, making the other player winner.\u00a0\u00a0A player can also make strategic moves to trap the other player, eventually making them\u00a0fall along with the red tile they are\u00a0standing on hence becoming the last man standing/winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0:-</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 - W, A, S, D</li><li>Player 2 - UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT</li><li>ESC for Menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578f9021c49140e2d014cf2b10bfe704.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porush"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
