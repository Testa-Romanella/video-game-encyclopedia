The team with the most captured flags wins the match. Its simplicity makes room for fast-paced action and competitive team play, making Outgun have a strong fan base even 18 years after its launch.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game supports dedicated servers, bots, spectator mode and replays, as well as graphic and sound themes created by players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7bec76270d11ec12f71070e534250420.jpg", "website": "https://outgunctf.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabiana Cecin", "Niko Ritari", "Jani Rivinoja"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Onlumi.dev"], "esrb_rating": null}
