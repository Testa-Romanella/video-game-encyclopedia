Drop in prefabricated structures to build and customize any world to your liking.  Explore using helicopters, dragons, motorbikes or even gorillas and unlock treasures that enhance your gameplay.  Watch your creations come to life through characters and creatures that interact with you and each other in unexpected ways.
