{"id": 629282, "slug": "hero-babysitters-club", "name": "Hero Babysitter's Club", "name_original": "Hero Babysitter's Club", "description": "<p>tldr; M opens the menu in-game to give you your options and pause the game until you're ready to decide what to do. Arrow keys and WASD move you around, space is jump. Maker UI has hotkeys for almost everything, take advantage of them.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for GodotCon in July, 2021, to demonstrate\u00a0certain patterns for\u00a0cloud-based backends that I'll be discussing (though I won't go in-depth into the game itself, as I'm planning on selling it). The saving and loading for this game was done in a single day. Imagine what you can do with more time than that!\u00a0One thing to note is that this is purely an alpha build, with terrible graphics and about a third of the game completed, give or take.</p>\n<p>The gameplay:</p>\n<p>You play the yellow box-like character.\u00a0You are the Hero\u00a0Babysitter. You move with the arrow keys, or wasd, and jump with space bar.\u00a0You have to babysit the dumb, brutish, blue hero across the map to get to the exit door. You'll have a host of items at hand to use to get the hero to move how you want, whether they be mushrooms, trampolines, or more. Choose from a map anyone has made! Like a particular map and its gameplay, or think it's impossible and want to complain? Leave a comment here and give me the name of it!\u00a0I'll review it and if it doesn't work somehow, I'll delete it - if it's a great map, I'll showcase it in a gameplay video.</p>\n<p>When playing the game, you can hit the M button to open the menu. This will give you all the items available to you, as well as options.</p>\n<p>You can also make maps! These are saved online so you can share them with friends. All maps are public at the moment. In the editor, you have access to hotkeys that should make your life much, much easier, so keep that in mind and hover over the buttons with the mouse to see what the hotkey is. When making a map, make sure you've included the babysitter, the hero, at least one exit door, and given at least a single item to the babysitter - this will allow you to save the map. Note, there's also a test mode, which allows you to try out what you've built so you don't have to wonder if a trick will work or not.</p>\n<p>To turn off the music, at the moment, you have to go into the play of a game itself.\u00a0If you want to turn it off altogether, that's where to do it, and it'll be gone as long as you leave the game open.\u00a0If you want to increase it, you can do that too - more music, and selectable music in the editor (so it plays the right song for your map) are on the way.</p>\n<p>Finally, please leave comments! I'd like to release this game, and more testing is better. I will likely be culling maps over time, so don't be too surprised if yours disappears suddenly.</p>\n<p>Mushrooms don't stick unless they're on the ground.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c06c86f022b963588bafed7ee9e576b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BackAt50Ft"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
