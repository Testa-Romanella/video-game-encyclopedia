You\u2019re a refugee from the \u201cAndromeda War\u201d that has put your hometown in ruins and you are seeking for shelter. Recalling from the memories of your home, you remember an escapee tell you that there is an organization that is sheltering survivors. They own a hidden bunker that requires each person to go on a special mission to gain access. You will be avoiding enemies in the level, collecting items and objects along the way, to get through the map and gain access to the bunker. Because the setting takes place in a dystopian world that has been devastated by an alien virus, the events take place in the near future (approximately 3000 AD). The area that the player is tasked is within a dystopian city runner by ponderous creatures and robots that will attack anything in sight. The world will be an open world that is surrounded by buildings and debris that the player will be able to hide underneath to avoid getting caught by the enemies. There will be a path that will guide the player to the necessary objects and there will be several paths that the player will take to get around the city. However, if there was an enemy that was to chase the player, the player will need to get away from the enemies range of sight to safely continue the journey or they will face lethal consequences.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Player can:</strong></p>\n<p>- Use arrow keys or W,A,S,D keys to move</p>\n<p>- Press space to jump</p>\n<p>- Hold\u00a0shift to run</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Game made in Unity by Clinton Thai</p>\n<p>Art Assets:</p>\n<p>Unity Store - to be added</p>\n<p>Music/SFX:</p>\n<p>Unity store - to be added</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d766490c542769617e05936ca2148425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ClintonThai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
