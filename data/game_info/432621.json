Sorry if the game isn't that polished or buggy as like I said its my first time creating a game and I am fairly young for creating a game. Everything in this game was created by me not including\u00a0the audio or the font. I hope you enjoy my game and if you find a bug please report it by commenting\u00a0it below. Also sorry that it was only full-screen I had an error with the UI not scaling to the screen so I had to use full-screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b9/9b9255adcd659e0ea537272c4cb6f1b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samwich74"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
