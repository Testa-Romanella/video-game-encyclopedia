{"id": 56164, "slug": "pac-man-vs", "name": "Pac-Man Vs.", "name_original": "Pac-Man Vs.", "description": "<p>Pac-Man Vs. (\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3vs., Pakkuman Buiesu) is a video game in the Pac-Man series developed by Nintendo and published by Namco for the GameCube. It was originally included as an extra bonus disc with the Player's Choice edition of Pac-Man World 2, as well as in the GameCube versions of I-Ninja and Namco's R: Racing Evolution. The Japanese version was originally released only for the Club Nintendo members.</p>\n<p>The game itself takes advantage of the GameCube's connectivity with the Game Boy Advance (GBA), and cannot be played without the Game Boy Advance and the link cable to hook it up to the GameCube. It is one of a few select GameCube games designed around the system link, including Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. It is one of the earliest examples of asymmetric gameplay from a Nintendo game, about nine years before the release of the Wii U and its bundled Wii U GamePad, which is marketed as a tool designed to allow this kind of gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game is included in the Namco Museum DS game collection and supports single-cartridge multiplayer. The game was also released for Nintendo Switch as part of the Namco Museum compilation in July 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T18:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e32fd429e2ece502edc081645a291475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 28, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
