In response to the theme of 'roots', you have the power to summon roots to help in your traversal of old worn buildings, in order to explore and summit the tallest building of them all. We consider this short demo a prototype for ideas that could hopefully be further realized for an experiential gameplay experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T14:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742cedddb6177b62b81636bdecbb8fa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MitchellFoo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
