Z to jump, X to shoot and C to change weapon. \r\n\t<br/>\r\nJoystick: A to jump, X to shoot and Y to change weapon. \r\n\t<br/>\r\nDown to interact.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Building and stuff<p>\r\n\tThis game was made with Unity 5.3.4f1 personal edition.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe whole game was programmed trying to follow the multitier architecture, so there is a lot of abstraction between different stuff. This proved more useful than annoying (I thought that it would be difficult, but I actually love this way of coding, it's so simple to replace stuff!).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere are lots of Data Transfer Objects, even the character is setted up that way. I thought of making the game three times longer but I ran out of time, the idea was to configure through a DTO the new character controller of every level. Although if I want to retake it in the future is coded in such a way that wouldn't prove to many difficulties to understand the code again.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso, another detail, there is not a single rigidbody in the whole game. I took as a challenge to write up my own physics. In the beginning I hated it, but then I understood a lot more than before.\r\n</p>A little glitch<p>\r\n\tThere are a couple of glitches or typos. Sometimes you get stucked to a wall, jump to release.\r\n</p>Credits<p>\r\n\tMost of the art and all of the design/programming was made by \r\n\tme. <br/>\r\nThe other part of the art was made by Yamila Diaz. \r\n\t<br/>\r\nMusic was borrowed (with permision) from \r\n\tBaddas Wolf Shirt.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f822488ac546d97045f307c5db4faea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Javier Bullrich"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
