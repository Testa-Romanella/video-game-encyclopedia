A number of jewels and hearts will appear on the map.\u00a0 After a certain amount of time, more jewels will appear on the map.\u00a0The first player to collect 50 jewels wins.</p>\n<p>You can fire your jewels at your opponent (you will lose a jewel for each one you fire). The AI can also fire jewels at you, without losing jewels. If you hit your opponent, you will deal damage. Deal enough damage and your opponent dies. If a player dies they restart at their original location with 0 points.\u00a0The AI will only start firing jewels when you have reached 20. When you reach 40 he will fire 4 at once.</p>\n<p>Collecting hearts from the map restores health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Click on the square you want to travel to</p>\n<p>Up arrow - Fire jewel up</p>\n<p>Down arrow - Fire jewel down</p>\n<p>Left arrow - Fire jewel left</p>\n<p>Right arrow - Fire jewel right<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Since you can't see the grid it can be hard to select the right square.
