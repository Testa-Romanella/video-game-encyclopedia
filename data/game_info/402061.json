Knowledge of firepower was lost to the ages, and the planet and its moons have had peace for eons. Boring peace...</p>\n<p>You are one of the seven  Lunar Rulers with big plans for expansion. As a Future Empress, not having weapons or an army could be a detriment to your campaign. Luckily, you have energy balls! Destroy fleets of ships from your rivals without worry of retaliation. Well, maybe have a little bit of worry, as the others have developed ways of fighting without weapons as well!</p>\n\n<p>Play with your keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. Keep the ball from falling backwards and hitting your own fleet. You know how these types of games go :P</p>\n<p>Everything is made by me, apart from the guy voices which I made Mr. PepperGhost do. If there are any bugs, plz yell at me on twitter and I will try to fix them! (But don't actually yell, as I spook easily.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8d202f64e59370fca08ab6f0c6b6f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PepperGhost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
