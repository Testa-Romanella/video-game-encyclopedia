Take the role of one of the many challengers and use the power of air blaster to interact with your environment and push your opponents far away. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each character holds an air blaster that allows it to control the wind. You can then interact with his environment by vacuuming or blowing back objects at your opponents to help clear a path towards your goal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't just push people around on the island, compete in the extreme volcanic soccer mode, the explosive dodge ball mode, the snowball fight mode and many more! Find all of these game modes in the Tournament Mode!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The controls are super simple and reactive which makes the game easy to pick up by anyone. The games are short and easy to understand, perfect for a friendly competition between family and friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Up to 8 players can play simultaneously locally or online. Don't worry, you can still practice your skills against our own artificial intelligence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Random dynamic events happen during the game while the storm is brewing. You may have to face thunder and rain, landslides, meteors, lava geysers or avalanches so keep an eye out for those.<br/><br/>\u200b", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b06720b3a21c6439b8ce8baf97631a.jpg", "website": "http://aeolistournament.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 74, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Beyond Fun Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Beyond Fun Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
