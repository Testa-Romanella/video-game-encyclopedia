The theme was \"Out Of Control\". This is more a prototype/proof of concept than a finished game. <br/></p>\n<p>The whole city is under lockdown, and all the food transport trucks and the roads are out of control! Add new tiles to the board to ensure that the trucks can reach all the houses to deliver food to the people stuck at home. The Vehicles will pick up food at the stores on the side of the map.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse Click: Push new tile to a row or column</li><li>Tab: Rotate Tile</li>There is currently no goal or end to the game. If a house does not receive food, after a certain time the people in it will starve.</ul>\n<p>While the game is not finished/polished, I had a lot of fun implementing the Vehicle AI - it can find target destinations easily, even on a changing map. The navigation code also scales well and works without lag even on very big maps or with lots of vehicles. The Vehicle AI will pickup food at the stores if none is carried, and will roam around or find a house whch requires food and drive there if possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:32:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e10576b755ab8fd3b67bad39b7de602.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MimmoO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
