But trust us, there is something to master, and we've been having a blast with it.\u00a0\r\nPlay well with your movement. Watch for your resources and cooldown. Switch spell frequently to avoid waiting for cooldowns. Use the time slow to assess the situation. Learn the wave patterns and prioritize targets.\u00a0\r\nYou won't beat the game first try, but it's beatable. Have fun !<p>A project by Pierre Benassi--Deschamps\u00a0alias Ryokugin\u00a0(programming, visuals) and Adrien Place (game design, sound, music).</p>\n<p>Combine your main element with other elements that you find to yield powerful spells in this arcade brawler !\r\n</p>\n<strong>Movement :</strong>\n<p>A or D to move left/right.\r\n</p>\n<p>Space to jump / double jump.\r\n</p>\n<p>S to fast fall / drop from platforms.\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift to dash left or right.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Attacks :</strong>\n<p>Use your mouse to aim.\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click to fire the base spell.\r\n</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3, 4 to select which element to yield as secondary. (Alternatively : A, E, R, F)\r\n</p>\n<p>Press and release right click to fire a combined spell. <strong>Combine</strong> your main element with your currently yielded one to fire different spells !\r\n</p>\n<p>Watch out though, because spells have cooldowns and cost mana.\r\n</p>\n<p>Collect more mana by killing enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>Overkill them to get even more mana !

We may add them in the future.\r\n</li><li>There are currently 22 waves in the game, and neither of us could reach the end in playtesting (it\u2019s hard).
