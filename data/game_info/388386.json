{"id": 388386, "slug": "zombie-blast-crew", "name": "Zombie Blast Crew", "name_original": "Zombie Blast Crew", "description": "The Blast Crew update is finally here. Pick your favorite survivor and use their unique stats, skills and weapon to define your own playstyle. Agile Karen\u2019s flamethrower? Bulky Bill\u2019s shotgun? All up to you!<br/><br/>It has been 11 months since the infection started. Everyone fled the cities, mass panic in the streets. The zombies took over our towns, our buildings, our block. Now we sleep outside while they roam our streets.<br/>We waited on the army, and the army didn\u2019t come, so we picked up snaiper guns. We waited on a hero, and a hero didn\u2019t come, so we were left to survive. Now we\u2019re done waiting. Will you lead us in the face of (not really) certain doom?<br/><br/>We\u2019ve organized into hunting parties, to take our block back and push the evil residents away. We officially declare that from today onwards, our city is a Zero Z Zone. We\u2019re the Zombie Blast Crew. We crush the infected. Join the team.<br/><br/><br/>TAKE THE TOWN BACK<br/>As members of the Zombie Blast Crew, we have many objectives to accomplish - some fit for a scout, some for a hunter, some for a warrior - but we only have one true goal: pushing the killer zombies back. Pack your guns, scout the area, and eliminate anything that glows green.<br/><br/>Each mission takes place in a new zone of the city, where your survivor will have to be shooting the walking dead target to stop the pandemic invasion, and make use of the rules of survival and your gear craft to come back uninjured. There needs to be some of us left to survive, after all.<br/><br/><br/>TACTICAL ZOMBIE REMOVAL <br/>Special zombe come in different shapes and forms: some will rush you, some will snaiper shoot you from a distance, some will take a ton of damage before going down. One thing is certain, they\u2019re all stupid zombies. It\u2019s on you to know when to engage, when to sneak, when to evade and not raise their alert status, and when to rush in. The options are open, and your tactics will be thoroughly tested. They might be dumb, but the Z are always dangerous as a group - it\u2019s a leader\u2019s responsibility to adopt the right strategy to minimize casualities and maximize loot.<br/><br/>PACK UP - CREW, GUNS  AND GEAR <br/>Planning and getting the proper crew and equipment is already half the battle. No hero gets through a battle without his sword, and no crew member goes in the field without their gun. Big walking dead target crowds? Karen and her flamethrower got you covered. Need to keep your distance from certain stupid zombies? Michael\u2019s assault rifle or Javier\u2019s machine gun might be a better pick. It\u2019s all about using your head, knowing your craft and picking the right man (or woman) for the right job.<br/><br/>Same goes for our gear. Do you pack a scout medkit to heal zombe injuries? Some grenade to clear infection areas? Some food to get yourself a hunter survival boost? Don\u2019t rush in, it pays to be prepared. And don\u2019t forget to polish your skills - levelling up will help your snaiper shooting.<br/><br/>MISSION SELECT<br/>There\u2019s a lot to do to reclaim our big city. On top of our main doom campaign, we take part in unique stradegy games to help with the clean up - repel increasingly large waves of walking dead target in Horde mode, shoot and explode as many Z as possible in Killing Feasts, or accomplish as many objectives as possible in Challenge Rush. Every bit of dead target zombe helps.<br/><br/>LOW POLY CITY<br/>It might be home, but seeing it again after all this time\u2026 it feels nostalgic. We\u2019ve got objectives and a pandemic to stop, but it\u2019s not all doom and gloom: take in the views too. Forget about the rules of survival for a second and admire. It\u2019s a pretty unique style, ain\u2019t it?<br/><br/>It\u2019s a huge arena, with tons of resources to pick up and hidden tracks to follow. Just don\u2019t play hero and meet your doom to the Z.<br/><br/>Got a question?
