Your tasks that you have to master in Obby with Kitty.<br/><br/>Obby is a combination of obstacle and jumping puzzle. The aim is to find the right path and, above all, to master it. Kitty has to make it through different levels. Sometimes you're above the clouds, sometimes in a dark dungeon or trying to cross a lake.<br/>Jumping from stone to stone may sound easy, but if these stones move or are hardly bigger than you, the whole thing becomes much more difficult.<br/>If one or the other puzzle is added or exact timing is required, the level of difficulty increases enormously.<br/>In the beginning it might be enough for you to reach the end of a level with many targeted jumps and some timing, if necessary with a little help.<br/>But if you want to collect all the stars or even be among the first in the leaderboard, every jump must be right and your timing must always be right.<br/>It sounds difficult, and it is. But who doesn't love a challenge.<br/><br/>- Master tricky jumps<br/>- Balance over narrow bridges<br/>- Dodge nasty traps<br/>- Solve puzzles<br/>- Find the right timing", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T02:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb8821f1b08ad8202e0645790596521e.jpg", "website": "https://game-devs.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcel S.", "Sven S."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Game-Devs"], "esrb_rating": null}
