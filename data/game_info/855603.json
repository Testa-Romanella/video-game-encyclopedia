But there are some resources I found super useful and used some of them I used in the codebase as well.

Each mission has its own sprites and music, as well as a code responsible for available enemy types, including their attack and movement patterns. Common SFXs and sprites are copied from the main cart to missions carts with use of\u00a0MEMCPY\u00a0and a user data memory area (0x4300-0x55ff), preserved across loaded carts). Moreover, I implemented this in a way which allows me to use same codebase to load both locally developed carts as well as those published to\u00a0Lexaloffle BBS.\r\n</li><li><strong>circular clipping</strong>: during shockwave a ring of inverted colors propagates from the player. To achieve that I had to learn how to implement\u00a0circular clipping masks\u00a0in a CPU-performant way.\r\n</li><li><strong>dithered fade-in/out transition</strong>: basically a set of rectangles filled with\u00a0FILLP\u00a0patterns, moving over screen.\r\n</li><li><strong>high score</strong>: usage of PICO-8's API to read and store data persisted on a host machine\r\n</li><li><strong>code minification</strong>: with my code style (full of spaces and long names), I found it easy to hit PICO-8's characters' count limit. Therefore\u00a0I forked and modified luamin tool\u00a0and incorporated it into this game's build flow, resulting with characters' count reduced by around 50%.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T15:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a9/4a900e31a2946e09e6dbdc78c3a48a61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beetroot Paul"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
