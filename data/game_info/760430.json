I've been unable to resolve GWT bugs, despite that being what this game was designed for. Don't leave it on the main menu for longer than about\u00a010 minutes\u00a0- the video player leaks memory. I'll continue trying to fix it for GWT but this emergency JAR will have to do for the time being.\r\n</p>\n<p>15 Underground and 15 Overground! But which is which? Tackle them all yourself or take on the challenge with a friend or two!\r\n</p>\n<p>Information should be up-to-date as of March 2022, though some of the photos are really quite outdated.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are not one for mice, this game also supports keyboard controls. Enter to start; 1-3 to select player count; Up Arrow to guess Overground; Down Arrow to guess Underground; F to toggle full screen; hold H\u00a0to hide roundels.</p>\n<p>Trivia: About\u00a055% of the Underground isn't even underground.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game has no affiliation with Transport for London. Their roundels are protected under the Trade Marks Act 1994.
