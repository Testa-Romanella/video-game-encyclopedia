The combat is turn based and involves opposing armies which you can move between planets.\u00a0This project was inspired by several of my favorite board games and sci-fi stories.\u00a0It is more of a prototype/proof of concept for a larger idea that I have. Each playthrough of the game is meant to be quick so that it can be played a few times.</p>\n<p>This is the first full game I\u00a0have ever finished and released. I would love any feedback on ways I can make the game better!<br/></p>\n\n<p>As of now I will probably update the game at a later point with any bug fixes or balance changes it might need.</p>\n\n<p>** Notes: The \"How To\" button is currently disabled because I am unsure if\u00a0it is necessary. I like the idea of players figuring out how to play on their own.</p>\r\nDeveloper:\r\n<p>My name is 0hSlash. I am an aspiring game developer and pixel artist.
