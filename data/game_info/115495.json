Inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's dumb book of the same name, and Persona 5's ridiculously cool style.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CLICK/TAP</strong> and hold to move around<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WALK NEAR PEOPLE</strong> to meet them and see their names<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>STAND AND TALK FOR A WHILE</strong> with people to raise your friendship level with them (level 1 = colored border, level 2 = colored body, level 3 = hyper animated border). They will then introduce you to people over time. Make sure to come back and talk with your friends every few days or else they will forget about you!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MEET ALL 1000 PEOPLE TO WIN!</strong></p>\n<p>Sorry, there's no audio! But feel free to put the Persona 5 soundtrack on loop in the background while you play. That's how I developed the game, after all!</p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong>https://github.com/foolmoron/TheTippingPoint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00a66713e084ddf5fe9a8ce636ccf442.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["foolmoron"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
