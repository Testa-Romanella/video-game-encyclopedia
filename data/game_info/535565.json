{"id": 535565, "slug": "zombies-cool", "name": "Zombie's Cool", "name_original": "Zombie's Cool", "description": "- Game Description<br/>Zombie's Cool is a growth-type shooting action game in which you have to mop up zombies that frequently pop up in town while searching for the root of the zombie virus.<br/><br/>- Weapon System<br/><br/>\u25a0 Single Shot Pistol: You can use it limitlessly, but its firepower is weak.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Machine Gun: The damage dealt per bullet is low, but since its per-second firing speed is high, you can deal a lot of damage within a short time.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Shotgun: It has a short range, but it deals a lot of damage to multiple enemies.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Launcher: Along with an explosion, it inflicts physical damage on multiple enemies and also causes flame damage, which zombies can spread to each other.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Laser Gun: No matter what kind of enemy you're facing, they can be brought down with a single shot from this gun. You can only use it a single time during the game, though.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Double-handed Pistols: Shots that hit enemies irregularly bounce of to other areas. If you're lucky, you can bring down multiple foes with a single shot.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0 Gunkata: Fire double-handed pistols at random with a cool pose. Looks awesome, no matter how many times I see it!<br/>Gunkata can be used once per stage after it is opened.<br/><br/>Most of the weapons can be upgraded.<br/>Once you upgrade, you'll experience how, while the beginning is a bit Souls-like, the end is pure Warriors!<br/><br/>- Stage Types<br/>Just as there are many different weapons, there are also various stage types as well.<br/>\u25a0 Normal Stage: All you have to do is wipe out enemies. It's the ideal type of stage for earning coins. Within the Normal Stage type, there's also the Nighttime Stage sub-type.<br/>At night, the zombies' attack power increases tremendously, and you have to fight them while relying only on the light you get when you fire off shots.\"<br/>\u25a0 Death Race Stage: Within a time limit, you have to exterminate zombies on the map with a zombie car.<br/>\u25a0 Baseball Stage: You have to stop the zombies rushing to home with baseballs.<br/>\u25a0 Barricade Stage: You have to stop the zombies trying to get through the barricade.<br/>\u25a0 Escort Stage: You have to escort survivors to the escape point.<br/>\u25a0 Big Escape Stage: You have to drive a tank to the escape point while defeating the enemies swarming upon you.<br/>\u25a0 Boss Stage: Zombie's Cool features five bosses who possess varied patterns. You have to defeat these bosses if you want to progress further in the story.<br/><br/>- Coins and Upgrades<br/>Once you upgrade your weapons' and the player's abilities, stages you once thought were difficult will be able to be cleared with ease. <br/>All upgrade elements within the game are carried out using coins.<br/>You can earn more and more coins the higher your combo chain number, which rises as you kill enemies, goes. <br/>Be careful though, the chain is broken if you are attacked by an enemy or if a set amount of time passes without you killing an enemy.<br/>That doesn't sound very easy, you say? Well then, maybe you should try replaying the previous stage a few times to collect some money then upgrade your weapons.<br/>If you do that, then at some point, you'll be able to enjoy the experience of having coins gush forth suddenly.<br/>Coins can solve anything in this game!<br/>Just be sure to remember to maintain your combo chain by not letting enemies attack you!<br/><br/>- Multiple Round Elements<br/>So you've seen the first round ending?<br/>Then you should try the Normal and Hard difficulties too, where even stronger zombies and bosses are awaiting you.<br/>Thanks to diverse zombies risking life and death to fling themselves at you from an early phase, you'll be able to experience a different feeling then you did when you played the Easy difficulty.<br/><br/>- Enemy Types<br/>There are also many different types of enemies.<br/>\u25a0 Walker: Moving at a sluggish pace, it's ready to become a good source of coins for the player.<br/>\u25a0 Rusher: Once it approaches a certain distance, it goes mad chasing after the player.<br/>\u25a0 Smasher: It's not only great at taking blows, it's also got great attack power and mobility.<br/>\u25a0 Eater: It's the slowest moving of all the zombie types, but also the strongest against attacks, so it will soak up all the bullets you throw at it like a sponge, leaving you with no ammo left.<br/>\u25a0 Helldog: It's the weakest against attacks, but it leaps all over the place, making the player busy just keeping up with it.<br/>\u25a0 Crawler: It crawls around on the ground while shooting out scary acidic spit, requiring a continuous exercise of judgment and control from the player.<br/><br/>- Wait just a second...<br/>Did you just say you don't think you can handle playing, because of all the different enemies?<br/>This isn't the first time I'm telling you this, but when you feel like that, you should discuss things with some coins.<br/>Coins can solve any problem you'll run into in this game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T02:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/31628f0a463c2ac1faba4e3e0b5b377a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Museum"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Game Museum"], "esrb_rating": null}
