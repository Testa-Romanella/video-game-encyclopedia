Why not assist fate and rid this beautiful island of its pesky Dodo Infestation so you can have all the berries for yourself?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chase, Torment, and Terrify a flock of below average intelligence dodos. Help them in their journey to fall into lava, off cliffs, through fire, or just about anything without a railing.\u00a0Arm yourself with Squawks and Sin to do unto these poor excuses for life what they might just do to themselves anyway.
