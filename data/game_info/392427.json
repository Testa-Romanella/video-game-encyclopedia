Over time, mankind's faith in the Greek gods faded, allowing Hades to escape the kingdom of the dead and wreak havoc. As the demigod Hermes, you must slip on your winged sandals and lead a team of rescuers across a decimated land in pursuit of your enemy, saving the people you encounter and their homes as you go.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe servants of Hades will be waiting for you around every bend and turn in the road. To secure the help of Zeus, Ares, Artemis and more, you'll need to restore their demolished altars and make sacrifices in their name. Only then will you be able to use the unique skill each god grants you to defeat satyrs, a three-headed beast and more. You'll also be granted the ability to heal a poisoned land and restore the lives of the people that populate it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach thrilling level will challenge you to remove cleverly placed obstacles and figure out the quickest way to gather and produce the resources you need. The faster you succeed, the more stars and achievements you'll earn!
