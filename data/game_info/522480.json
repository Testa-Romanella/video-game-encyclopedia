So here we are! I've begun working on a new take to an old classic.</p>\n<p>What is currently available is a prototype to show off the very bare-bones design of the game. I debated doing an early prototype as I know they can be very misleading, however I felt the need to do so and start getting the game out there for people to play with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks I'll be working on it steadily and refining/adding features until it is at an Alpha stage.</p>\n\n<p>PLANNED FEATURES (ASAP):</p>\n<p>Body segment damage &amp; destruction (when attacked by enemies).</p>\n<p>Body segment growth\u00a0(via eating citizens).</p>\n<p>Various enemy types, each with their own stats and weapons.</p>\n<p>Citizen NPC AI able to flee to buildings and other forms of cover and seek out Military NPCs for protection.</p>\n<p>Military NPC AI able to group up in order to attack you more optimally.</p>\n<p>Randomly generate and place NPCs based on each level's stats.</p>\n<p>Randomly generate levels based on predefined options or selecting level templates.</p>\n<p>Customizable snakes.</p>\n<p>Several types of base snakes (each with their own stats and appearance).</p>\n<p>PLANNED FEATURES (LATER):</p>\n<p>Multiplayer Modes:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Snake-vs-Snake: In this mode, two to four players are pitted against one another to complete various challenges.</p>\n<p>- Snake-vs-Humans - In this mode one player is the snake in the standard mode, the other player takes on an RTS-style opposition, placing units and moving them about the map, giving them attack commands (or setting them to Overwatch to attack automatically) and protecting the citizens from that big damn snake!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/612/612413aa0c97d4d6c5624e81074a12f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALogan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
