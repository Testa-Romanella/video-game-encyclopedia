That's the game.<br/><br/>In this roguelite, topdown arena, semi autobattler you will use various skills and items to create unique, powerful builds to defeat all the mega evil farm animals. And get all the carrots!<br/><br/>There is a nice variety with a lot of different skills, items, stats and other modifiers, that will make each run interesting.<br/>Each run you will take on an Identity (class if you will), which you can focus your build around. Some with unique skills.<br/><br/>The story might be nearly non-existing, the graphics dorky and lacking, and the sounds a bit tedious, but you might find the gameplay interesting if you are into roguelite games. Or if you really like carrots.<br/>In either case, I hope you will have a good time playing my game!<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>20+ Identities (classes) with different play styles<br/></li><li>30+ Unique Skills<br/></li><li>120+ Items<br/></li><li>Various different enemy types with different behaviour and attacks<br/></li><li>20-30 minutes per run (and you can always save during a run)<br/></li><li>Permanent unlocks and improvements</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T09:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b110acfa46a881bc3b2f2e39866e9c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lil Leader Official", "Egome Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Egome Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
