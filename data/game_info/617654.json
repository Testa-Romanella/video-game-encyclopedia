I got a little carried-away refining the menu, audio, and opening sequence, but I\u00a0plan to finish-out the idea in the coming weeks, so stay posted!</p>\n<p>Also, I'm proud to say that everything (except the fonts and about half of the audio)\u00a0in this game was programmed, drawn, or mouth-recorded from scratch by yours-truly in GameMaker Studio 2!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/058/0581df2f7d7b31f8aae2710e14a31bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mewwww17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
