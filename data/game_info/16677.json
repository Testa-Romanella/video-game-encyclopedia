The game mixes intelligent story with immersive and actual medieval surroundings. Arx Fatalis allows the player to feel that all his actions have a direct consequence on those around him.<br />\nThe goal of the game is to destroy the secret cult of Akbaa, the god of destruction. As a player, you must prevent the return of such a cruel creature to the physical world. Should you fail, Akbaa is bound to impose its terror upon the world of Arx.<br />\nYou will become the hero of an underground world - with weapons, spells and magical items to defend against goblins, trolls, rat-men and other vicious opponents.<br />\nBesides brute force, stealth and the &quot;onscreen gesture based magic system&quot; are the three alternative ways to succeed.   Using the mouse, flaming runes can be drawn in mid-air.  A combination of these gestures can create powerful magic spells that will protect you or empower you to defeat opponents and pursue the quest.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2002-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T17:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9e5/9e52a138701aa7e4f751e0f88361a9d8.jpg", "website": "http://www.arxfatalis-online.com/index_eng.php", "rating": 3.99, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 120, "owned": 1377, "beaten": 77, "toplay": 60, "dropped": 68, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 157, "suggestions_count": 509, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 163, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arkane Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Arkane Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
