This was probably a genius idea which someone else has almost certainly done before because I couldn't be bothered to check. The thing is that I'm kinda sick of it?\u00a0Like this project has turned into a real drag. So I'm just letting it go. It's mostly done but not quite, and definitely still has a few bugs which I\u00a0honestly cannot be bothered to fix.</p>\n<p>But if brick breaker but controlled like it's pinball sounds fun to you, you're welcome to enjoy 20 levels and an infinite randomly generated arcade mode. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T08:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/846b943d295741b5b3c6bd1908b0b014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cahatstrophe Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
