In Smash Up, players draft two faction decks from their choice of pirates, ninjas, robots, zombies, and more, and combine them to create a hybrid team that is a force to be reckoned with!<br/><br/><strong>A SPECIAL GAME EXPERIENCE! </strong><br/>The \"\"shufflebuilding\"\" game Smash Up starts with a simple premise: Take the twenty-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a forty-card deck, then compete to smash more Bases than your opponents! Each faction brings a different game mechanism into play \u2013 pirates move cards, zombies bring cards back from the discard pile, dinosaurs have huge power \u2013 and every combination of factions brings a different play experience.<br/><br/><strong>THINK STRATEGY! </strong><br/>During play, Base cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are in play. Combine wisely your characters and actions' cards to obtain the most power! You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy? How easy is it when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?<br/><br/><strong>SCORE THE 15 NECESSARY POINTS &amp; WIN THE GAME!</strong>When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro \u2013 try harder next time.<br/>With nine different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different than Ninja-Aliens, for instance. Which will you use to smash up your opponents?<br/>And did we mention the dinosaurs have laser beams?<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/>- Online Cross-platform multiplayer: 2 to 4 players<br/>- Play with 4 players or solo against the AI<br/>- 9 faction decks, including the base game set and more: Zombies, Aliens, Dinosaurs, Ninjas, Pirates, Robots, Tricksters, Wizards &amp; Geeks<br/>- Random or manual faction selection<br/>- Fully automated scoring<br/>- Tutorial system plus \u2018Step Through\u2019 and \u2018Review' modes to help players learn<br/>- Leader boards &amp; Achievements<br/>- Contains 16 Base cards to compete over", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-16T15:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f32/f3276f11348a1e8253213eba3260e8bb.jpg", "website": "http://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/smashup/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nomad Games", "VooFoo Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Asmodee Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
