The party begins their journey going on relatively simple quests, exploring the land, and treasure hunting, but they soon learn of a dark conspiracy in the nearby capitol that may threaten their home.</p><p>This was my first attempt at creating a video game, but proved to be too ambitious for what I was trying accomplish. Production was stopped after time, and the game will remain an incomplete demo of sorts. However, it is still playable to those who are interested in trying it out.</p><p>Release date: May 19th, 2010</p><p>Stories of Streamside\u2122<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b12ec9c6b1a8519f6a93c3ed426cffe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leggy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
