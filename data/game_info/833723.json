Although you might have other goals, but mostly, that\u2019s how you win the game.<br/><br/>Fair warning, although at the moment the content in the game is basically nothing, there will be a lot of violence, some gore, a lot of arrogant young masters and petty ancestors who could kill your character with just a sneeze in the future.<br/><br/>The game is in development and constantly changing. Almost everything here is a place holder for something else. So be prepare for tons of typos, bugs and imperfection.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:46:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbfce1790e905d2f8c031debcb1e3408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["captainwabbit"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
