On almost every\u00a0porch stood a snowman, made by happy children the day before. Lights covered the houses\u00a0and through the windows you could see Christmas trees in every living room. This town truly\u00a0had the Christmas spirit, which was good because that day it was Christmas eve. Children\u00a0were already put to bed and dreaming about reindeers and sleigh bells and one particular\u00a0man in red. Gregory was also in bed, but not dreaming at all. He was thinking of those\u00a0reindeers and sleigh bells and. Wait, he could hear them! He could hear the bells. That must\u00a0be Santa Claus flying over the town.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A = walk to the left</li><li>D = walk to the right</li><li>E = interaction</li><li>W = jump</li><li>ESC = exit game</li></ul><p><strong>This game was made by five Communication &amp; Multimedia students in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.
