A wall might appear or dissapear, or a platform could turn hazardous to touch, etc.</p>\n<p>The scope of the game is quite small (that is, the game is bad), due to this being made for a game jam in a programming language i am not too familiar with. there are only few levels, no sound, no particles or effects to smooth out gameplay. The provided files also only work on windows (and might not even then). If you use any other os and want to spend significant effort to play this game, then you can go to the github page and build it yourself.</p>\n<p>The controls are a &amp; d for horizontal movement, space for jumping and r to go back to the previous checkpoint.</p>\n<p>Source code can be found at\u00a0https://github.com/Spansos/Conlang-Game-Jam--1\u00a0(for if you're a starving italian man in need of spaghetti, or the less common problem of not using the singular os I've provided a pre-build .exe for)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T14:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5818a385bcdd6ff06e5dd411d14cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Span-ish"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
