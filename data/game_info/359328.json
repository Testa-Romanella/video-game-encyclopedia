Climate change heated the world, but also caused extremely cold storms in the north. Northern Storm is a build-strategy game set in a little village in Sweden, at a nice little river between the mountains.

The simple goal of survival is increasingly harder to achieve as the storm becomes more and more deadly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/9609682976fa3160010d00a9afccffd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johannes F\u00f6rth"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Johannes F\u00f6rth"], "esrb_rating": null}
