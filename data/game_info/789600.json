You have the chance to interact with characters, objects, and look around in this open world tutorial where dialogue and narrative story are the most important core mechanics here in the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The skills demonstrated on display are an interactive dialogue system that is completely customizable and that has the user the option to pick through different choices. The impacts that the story has on the game is that the player has many options on if they want to talk to certain characters, as there are many answers and replies from questions by NPCs. A fresh UI system that tells the player about their quests and tasks gives an outlook to this game from a story standpoint. Cutscene usage of the player and two other NPCs makes this game feel immersive, as each NPC has custom idle animations given what role that they mean to the town. Particle effects on different items as well as picking those items up gives the player a sense of belonging and interactivity. Background music and special sounds once you approach items gives the player an idea of how far they are in their quest and it gives them context clues on if they are in the right area.</p>\n<p>Once the player begins the game, a message will pop up saying that you can press the \"J\" button on your keypad, as this will bring up your quest log. The quest log shows active, non-active, failed, and completed quests that you can do and have done. These quests can either start off from the very beginning of the game, or they can be given to you by talking and interacting with different NPCs and objects. Once you finish a quest, a message will display saying \"Quest Log Updates\", as this will let the player know that they have completed that certain quest and another one will begin, as it will show the player the name and description of the next quest on the upper right-hand corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Some key controls are listed here below:</strong></p>\n<p>The WASD and arrow keys\u00a0will control the direction of the player.</p>\n<p>Pressing Shift while holding down one of the arrow keys will allow the player to run.</p>\n<p>Spacebar will interact with both object and NPCs, as this can either be picking up an object or starting a conversation with an NPC.</p>\n<p>Moving the mouse around will show the player their intended view given where the mouse is point to or directed towards, as this will effect their movement and angle of the camera.</p><p><strong>Game created by Gabe Sotomayor.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T23:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e56/e56cbed6397d513b7f7be6775439f6b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabe Sotomayor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
