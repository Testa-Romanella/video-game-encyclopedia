{"id": 706260, "slug": "star-cops", "name": "Star Cops", "name_original": "Star Cops", "description": "<p>Star Cops is a short Visual Novel that follows a newly formed pair of detectives as they take on their first major case. They travel to the Zoldra system where local citizens are dying in highly unusual ways and must discover why.</p>\n<p>Once the two realize they have more of a connection to the case than it initially seemed, they must confront their own shortcomings in order to escape their pasts.</p>\n<p>This project leans further into the 'novel' side of the Visual Novel genre. By putting less focus into interactivity the experience was made to feel more like reading a carefully crafted graphic novel with built-in music and sounds. It is driven primarily by a mildly dark\u00a0plot and relatable character interactions as opposed to player agency or hooking gameplay.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\u00a0Character Design - <strong>Jasmine Dillard</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Backgrounds - <strong>Megan Clarke\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Music/Sounds - <strong>Kaeden Harrell\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Coding/Asset Design - <strong>Megan Herman</strong><strong>n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Narrative/Writing - <strong>Shaun Rosier</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d04aa71709c183011c127b8e3626b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Devastasnion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
