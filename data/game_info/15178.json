Not being able to predict what is going to happen next or where you are heading for you need to make your way through the increasingly maze-like becoming house to find a way out of this bad dream that you just woke up into. The only thing that goes with you is the wooden floor underneath your feet. <br/><br/>Gameplay Features: <br/><ul><li>Level Streaming -&gt; changing, appearing/disappearing, rotating rooms, corridors and objects </li></ul><ul><li>Unreal Engine 3 graphics (UDK) </li></ul><ul><li>Maze-like becoming house and environment (expanding environment) </li></ul><ul><li>Puzzle Elements (Keys, Collecting and some Jump 'n' Run or Platforming) </li></ul><ul><li>Adequate Scares (no screamers)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T08:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c7837598dac81e0095eae1d0a454ecb2.jpg", "website": "http://www.wooden-floor-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 311, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pheenix93"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pheenix93"], "esrb_rating": null}
