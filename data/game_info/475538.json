If you synch your button presses well, you can give them a push to make them stay up. The more you have in the air at the same time, the higher your scores!\u00a0If they all fall off, you lose. How high can you go?</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>- move the paddle with LEFT and RIGHT</p>\n<p>- give a boost with UP</p>\n<p>- the timing of the boost with the moment a ball hits the paddle dete thrmines both how much additional speed it gains and your score. 100 is a simple bounce, 500 is a boost perfectly synchronised with the hit, 200 and 300 for good but not perfect timing</p>\n<p>- the score is additionally multiplied by how many balls are on screen at the same time. Keep as many up as possible!</p>\n<p>- new balls keep falling from the top</p>\n<p>- if a ball falls down the bottom, it disappears</p>\n<p>- if a ball manages to disappear again from the top, you get 1000 points, but it disappears too. Don't make your last ball disappear this way or you'll still lose!</p>\n<p>- if you lose, press ESC to restart</p>\n\n<p>Game made for #trijam 80.
