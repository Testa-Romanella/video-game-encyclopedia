This meant that I was to be responsible for creating all aspects of the project; from scripts to 3D assets. I decided to do this to test a range of skillsets that I had learned over the previous 2 years of my course. After brainstorming project ideas and concepts I decided I would make use of both 3D and 2D gameplay in a stealth based game set in the near future where AI has been implemented in a range of devices and unified in a network.\u00a0AI\u00a0development company 'AI Net' have been building their influence through this increased dependence on AI and have launched a global hostage situation. The player is a small, older model AI robot, that never had network access,\u00a0with the objective of retrieving data from servers while avoiding detection.\u00a0Initially named 'Project: Rover' it would come to be officially named 'Byte Size' towards the end of the project (which consists of 8 characters much like how a byte contains 8 bits).<br/></p>\n<p>Throughout the project I learned how to create features such as a dynamic interactable map, Line of sight player detection, and enemy distraction. As well as this, I also gained experience implementing Wwise (an audio solution for games) into my project when I was\u00a0given the opportunity to collaborate with a music student at the university later in\u00a0development.</p><p>I decided it was best to keep the project's art style quite simple since I would be \"wearing a lot of hats\" so to speak and would need to distribute my time wisely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My 3D assets were created with the polycount in mind thus I used baking and other texturing techniques to keep it as low as I could while still creating good looking assets.</p><p>Overall, there's a lot I'd have liked to have done with 'Byte Size' before the submission deadline but I gained valuable experience creating new, unfamiliar game mechanics as well as increasing my understanding of the whole game development process.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd8e5ea0d34623530dad951f3d97c528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pricey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
