Sometimes a bit of friction would be nice, but there is none here. A bit of velocity will go a long way. Well, it may go a long, long, long way. Bodies in motion, Newton once said, remain in motion and promote a healthy lifestyle. Each star and planet posses a gravitational field. They may be used to course correct or burn your ship to cinders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are artificial borders to the play area. You will be reflected when you strike it. This is more of a pain than a feature, sorry. If I continue development of this bobble, I'll replace it with something better.</p>\r\nDevelopment Notes\r\n<p>I came upon the idea of gravity as a game play mechanic. I liked and wanted to explore the idea of multiple gravitational sources, attractive and repulsive, in order to create a dynamic play area. I also wanted to put in play a lot of bodies for these forces to act upon. Asteroids and your ship are the principal pieces of debris in the system.</p>\n<p>The game you are playing is the result of a partial week of work, vacation and all that. I was able to leverage my core library of scripts for many aspects of this project: power-ups, some of the flight mechanics. The visual assets and the\u00a0gravity controller are new and seems to work okay. It uses a static controller-style pattern. Each gravity source and target in the system registers itself when it is enabled, un-registering when disable or destroyed. Gravity is applied uniformly between each source and target each fixed-update of the frame. This is done by summing the vectors of each source/target combination. There are a few knobs to influence this. More tuning is in order. In particular, the overall gravitational constant and masses of bodies in the system need more inspection.</p>\n<p>This gravitational system seems to be able to handle many hundreds of items on my development machine. I am very interested to learn what the practical upper-limit is and what other system configurations are able to handle.</p>\r\nReview Feedback\r\n<p>Multiple folks have given great feedback. Here are some things to watch out for.</p>\n<p>The flight controls take some time getting used to. There is no friction. As a result, it is hard to bleed off a lot of velocity to change direction. A bit of velocity goes a long way.</p>\n<p>There are artificial borders to the play area. You will be reflected when you strike it. This is more of a pain than a feature, sorry. If I continue development of this bobble, I'll replace it with something better.</p>\n<p>It can be difficult to escape the gravity of a planet or star if you get sucked in. Go with your momentum and apply a thrust at about a 45 degrees. A thrust vector that is too steep won't help here. The best bet is to build up velocity and peel away.</p>\r\nEpilogue\r\n<p>Thanks for coming by.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1e22902f72a66b3f1f64b48d62b4700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RandyLarson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
