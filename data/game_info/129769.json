This money will be used to develop the Online Mode of the game as well as an Android version of the game that includes Online mode as well.</p><p>Also, after playing a round of this game you will be asked to take a survey on your experience with the game.  By taking the survey, you get a free copy of the full version of this game for the platform of your choice(Windows or Android) when it comes out.</p><p>A simplistic board-like game where players secretly plan out their strategies without the other players knowing. As of right now this game only has the ability to handle 2-4 players. And Online mode is in development, if you could donate, that would greatly help me with the rest of the development, I plan to make this an Android app if I can get enough money.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d565b1b5b5697bc8e7ce2466f4ab76ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnnyVancer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
