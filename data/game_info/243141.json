But if you want, you can pay me with constructive comments (and showing interest in the casting call) :3</p>\n<p>- Filled to the brim with inside jokes/random gaming/anime/pop/etc. references.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The prologue release\u00a0is\u00a0mainly to test the waters and see if a non-involved audience will find this playable despite the aforementioned writing quirks. Also, seeing if we can make a dent through the fact that this is actually a playable game rather than just a web series\u00a0(apparently the whole 'playable game' thing is\u00a0a selling point).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>The characters are intended to be relatively unique, but still sorta fit in to the Danganronpa universe as characters in their own right. They're also\u00a0supposed to reference my friends through obscure, hyper-exaggerated character qualities/quotes. These qualities were\u00a0exaggerated to the extent\u00a0that most of them didn't\u00a0recognise their own characters (true story).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The following is intended to credit content creators for work I have used which is NOT MY OWN:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Chi </strong>from <strong>Seichizu </strong>for being (and continuing to be) a WONDERFUL sprite artist.
