Each has a unique amount of health and attack strength.</li></ol>Gamepad Controls:<ul><li>A - Jump</li><li>B - Dodge/Roll</li><li>X - Attack 1</li><li>Y - Attack 2</li><li>Up - Interact</li></ul>Mouse/Keyboard Controls:<ul><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Ctrl/LMB - Dodge/Roll</li><li>RMB - Attack 1</li><li>MMB - Attack 2</li><li>W - Interact</li></ul>Update 4: Ver. 0.15<p>I added the mapped controls to the beginning of the level.</p>Update 3: Ver. 0.14<p>Internalization Meter added, Camera follow and BOSS CAMS, tearing between tiles fixed, level flow/ \"what the hell am I doing\" improved, and the elevator is working for real now, I think.</p>Update 2:<p>Fixed elevator and dodge roll. Also I don't think you could \"Finish\" the game before... Now you can!</p>Update 1:<p>I kinda fixed the elevator from the first build. It's still a bit screwy though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6dfb55640af22f9a0f41ad7eb73e36b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brandon Schapekahm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
