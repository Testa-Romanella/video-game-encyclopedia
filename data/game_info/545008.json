This is my first game jam that I can proudly say I have fully completed a game for the Kindred Game Jam. The game was made using two themes voted on by the Kindred Game Community, \"Penguin Party\" and \"The Fire Mustn't go out\". There is an attacking party of penguin raiders who wants to put out your fire, and you have to stop them before it's too late. I hope you have fun playing the game and feel free to leave feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T06:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/717725bfab8e01e337ee863070f7a861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OreganoDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
