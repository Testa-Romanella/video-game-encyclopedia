Whether they accelerate or impede your performance is up to how and when you use them.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nIncluded in this game are...\r\n<ul><li>19 levels with 9 random preset stages each</li><li>10 powerups</li><li>4 little tunes</li><li>A \"Normal\" and \"Hard\" Mode</li><li>A few (secret) tunes and sprites</li><li>A secret 20th level \"boss\"</li><li>probably an hour of gameplay</li><li>a somewhat evil combo system</li><li>tears. many tears.</li><li>...and the occasional bug.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>What's the deal with Normal Mode? Well dying on a level simply restarts it with a different stage. Oh, and after your first thousand points, every thousand points grants an extra life. If you die in Hard mode, you start back at the beginning.\u00a0No life bonuses.</p>\n<p>What's the point of Hard mode? Well... you can figure that out.</p>\r\nIntentions:\r\n<p>This game was a project for myself to get involved with Pico-8, Lua, and general game development. It will likely remain in its current state with a few updates-here-and-there (certain glitches may be cleaned up at some point). I encourage any Pico-8 users to download the cartridge and tinker around with it.</p>\n<p>Credit to Krystman from the TeamworkCast for providing source code for his project, at https://pastebin.com/48rgwneq I modified a bit of his code for the basis of my game.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>All music and graphics were made using the Pico-8 fantasy console.</p>\n<p>The game's soundtrack is available on sound cloud at\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/bethveni/sets/beta-breakout-ost-1</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask questions or point out some glitches.(No guarantee that I will fix them any time soon.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b1e1cd43cd40d7cf3baef94b02c29ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nullveni \ud83d\udc26"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
