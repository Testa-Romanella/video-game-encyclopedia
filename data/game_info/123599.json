Feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p>Your goal is to dig up a buried treasure. To find the treasure, you must visit stone tablets with pieces of the treasure map etched on them. Meanwhile, wandering monsters will be an ever-present threat. Your party of adventurers must learn skills and gain items as they search if they are to survive their quest.</p>\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n<p>This game is a work in progress. There is a manual, but not all features have been documented. There may be bugs and/or freezes or crashes. 1600x900 resolution works best; I haven't tested any others.<br/></p>\n<p>Caveat\r\nlusor (player beware :) )<br/></p>\n<p>Contact me at: luminouswolf@protonmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75ecafa981b55eb665d73521000ae3fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luminous Wolf"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
