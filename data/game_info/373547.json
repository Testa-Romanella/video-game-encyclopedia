Move similarly colored fish in a row vertically or horizontally to chain. Collect points and watch the timer. In the game there are levels where you need to have time to collect the required number of points in the allotted time, as well as levels where you need to score points for a limited number of moves. There may also be obstacles that can be removed by folding the fish in a row next to the obstacles.
