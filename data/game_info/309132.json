Unfortunately, the current version of the game has a small bug that will prevent progress in the game if encountered. Since this is a jam game, I won't be able to fix that until the jam is over, but the game is still possible to finish if you skip doing the following: Do NOT ask Ava whether Raven and Evelyn were in her class. If you do, the bug will not allow you to continue. But if you don't do that, you will still be able to finish the game. Sorry about that! I will upload the fixed version of this game after the jam.</p>\n<p>Game developed by Illusia</p>\n<p>Made with Monogatari</p>\n<p>Characters made with\u00a0Mannequin</p>\n<p>Backgrounds from Pixabay</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Eric Matyas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T07:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e0f4c8368ec3b8e53d2337d5e37332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Illusia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
