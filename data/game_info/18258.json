Primarily a story of action and adventure, Requiescence features three prominent romance routes that significantly change the later portions of the game.<br/><br/>The game is also a BL (boy's love) game, which means both the main character and the love interests are male.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Nitro+CHiRAL games (Togainu no Chi, Lamento, DRAMAtical Murder, Sweet Pool), then you know how amazing a story can become when you mingle an epic adventure with intricate character relationships. Requiescence is heavily inspired by these games and aims for a similar style, while still putting a fresh twist on the BL genre.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d9458980b2ec8633af29f321b42ab871.jpg", "website": "http://argentgames.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Argent Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Argent Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
