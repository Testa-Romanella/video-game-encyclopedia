Rise up through the ranks and win prestigious awards or just focus on making it home in one piece; it's up to you.<br/><br/>This is a unique single-player game with RPG elements, extensive usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many variables (including morale, reach, confined space and high ground) and a touch of roguelike features. Among them, permadeath. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it means you'll have to start over if your character dies; but don't worry: the game is designed to be replayable and you'll see only a fraction of it in each run. Also, you'll be able to spend points on your next legionary based on how well your most successful characters performed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T01:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60cded780df14876abee80751fae1474.jpg", "website": "https://legionaryslife.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 19, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alessandro Roberti"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alessandro Roberti"], "esrb_rating": null}
