{"id": 490622, "slug": "beware-of-the-blob", "name": "Beware of the Blob", "name_original": "Beware of the Blob", "description": "Beware of the Blob is a puzzle &amp; crafting game with light stealth elements where you control a slime-like creature known as B.O.B. If you like quirky, light-hearted gameplay, zany humor, and fantastical body horror, you won\u2019t be disappointed. <br/><br/>Cartoonish, detached arms that wriggle in wait to capture victims, brains that slide when someone steps on them, disembodied projectile lungs are just some of what you\u2019ll find in the world of Beware of the Blob. Help B.O.B. escape from Black Hawk Industries HQ by eating lab personnel, crafting tools the organs they drop, and using those tools to solve puzzles.<br/><br/>We are a small team of recent graduate students and driven individuals who are passionate about games and game development. While we can\u2019t promise that no (virtual) lab personnel were harmed in the making of Beware of the Blob, we can promise you a few hours of a fun-filled fantasy.<br/><br/>Feel free to contact us if you have feedback, questions, or problems. We\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible and provide support if you need it.<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li> <strong>Eating People</strong> - take down humans by consuming them into B.O.B.'s gelatinous body <br/></li><li> <strong>Crafting Body Parts</strong> - use an innovative adjacency based crafting system to make new limbs on the fly<br/></li><li> <strong>Stealthy Blob</strong> - sneak around foes to escape from threats and find the right moment to strike<br/></li><li> <strong>Solving Puzzle</strong> - find novel uses for lungs, legs, hearts, and more to solve puzzles and escape<br/></li><li> <strong>Play Your Way</strong> - a wealth of accessibility options ensure that everyone can enjoy the game the way they want<br/></li><li> <strong>Retro Atomic Art Style</strong> -  Atomic Age Americana lives and breaths in every note and polygon<br/></li><li> <strong>Adaptive Soundtrack</strong> -  the Esquivel/1960s style music changes to match the Blob's current equipment</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T18:27:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6f0fd3ce0778ff70a971a11321d6fc1.jpg", "website": "http://www.bewareoftheblob.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Beware Blob"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Beware Blob"], "esrb_rating": null}
