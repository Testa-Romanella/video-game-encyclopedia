Nearing his 21st birthday, and with some pressuring from his father, he leaves the solitude of his home to meet up with a local group of tabletop gamers at his town's library. A newcomer to tabletop, Danny finds that his new friends are about as unusual as the characters they play in-game.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Ultimately, ARtP is a gay, branching visual novel about roleplay, identity, and escapism. There are three main \"routes\" for this story, with each route being associated with a certain character.
