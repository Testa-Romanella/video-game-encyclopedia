Jump on top of a frog to stack them. Try for three of the same color in a row to upgrade them (2048 style). If your stack gets too disorganized, try visiting the Sorting Lizard for some help. Finally, keep an eye on the timer and the height of your stack!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A, S = move left and right</p>\n<p>Space = jump</p><p><strong>Engine:</strong>\u00a0Verdant, MonoGame</p><p><strong>Source:\u00a0</strong>matthewd673/MiniJamFrogs (github.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T06:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd3e0e2fa486a3a7060b99761491134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Daly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
