I had to learn a lot from my god and saviour Brackeys, Dani and other sourcers online. Let me know what you guys think. I would love to get some tips on how to further improve my game and ofcourse the bugs that you guys will encounter :2</p>\n<p>The build here is for Windows and its a very early version of the game with low amount of content but the jist of it is implemented. I would like to release this on mobille eventaully on the Google Play Store for free.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I've left the implementation of my UI for later so there is no Exit button yet. Use Alt + F4 (proffesional developer here)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T02:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e37d00a2c73d6c7ccdfa46880d543209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VTheDrago0nS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
