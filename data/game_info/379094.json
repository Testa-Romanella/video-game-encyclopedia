Control corgis, herd alpacas, and pay off your loans so you can finally own your very own alpaca farm.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Your goal is to pay off your bank loan in 30 days.</p>\n<p>Each day is made up of two parts. The day, where you must herd as many alpacas into a pen as possible to be sheared, and the night where you spend the money you earnt from the wool.</p>\n<p>Day</p>\n<p>The day starts by you choosing your corgi positions. You can do this by clicking on the outer highlighted areas.</p>\n<p>Once the corgis have been placed, you start the day.</p>\n<p>Your aim for the day is to get as many alpacas in the pen as possible before you run out of turns. You do this by using your corgis to herd them around the field.</p>\n<p>To control a corgi,\u00a0you click on it to select it. Each corgi has a number of action points (AP), this shows how many moves they can do this turn. Whenever a corgi moves or waits, they create a point of influence that affects where nearby alpacas will move. This is represented by the corgi ghosts that appear. You can end a corgi's turn by pressing skip.</p>\n<p>At the end of the turn when all corgis have used all their AP (or been skipped), all alpacas will move. Their movement is based on surrounding influence points. You can see where an alpaca will move during the turn by the alpaca ghosts that appear.</p>\n<p>The day will end when you have herded all alpacas into the pen or you've ran out of turns.</p>\n<p>Night</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you will have a choice with what to spend your hard earned money on. You have these options:</p>\n<ul><li>Pay back loan - You can pay some or all of the loan back. This is optional and there is a minimum pay amount</li><li>Feed animals -\u00a0Each animal must be fed. If they are not, they will stay indoors for the next day (and you can not make money from them)</li><li>Buy animals</li><li>Sell animals</li></ul>\n<p>End of game</p>\n<p>You win the game if you end a day with 0 left to pay off your bank loan.</p>\n<p>You lose the game if you reach the end of day 30 without paying off your bank loan in full.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck alpaca farmer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project</strong></p>\n<p>This is game 9 of the \"Make 10 games in 10 weeks\" project by Paul from Paul Makes Games.
