I (solo) developed this for the blackthornprod game jam #3. The theme was: \"less is more\".\u00a0 The way that i interpreted this theme was by doing less of the stuff i am bad at like art, and more of the stuff i'm good at like programming. I also wanted to learn a lot of new things. So i animated sketches and i wanted to make a metroidvania-like game with different area's and unlocks and dialog and more and more and more.</p>\n<p>I spend a lot of time on this. This is my first ever released game (i did some game making in the past but never released something). I learned ALOT in this week :D</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ol><li>Animated sketches</li><li>4 area's where you have to rescue your friends</li><li>Multiple route's to take</li><li>Epic boss fight</li><li>All music &amp; sound effects\u00a0made by me and my guitar</li><li>Dialog</li></ol>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b7/1b78f04e6418e057ebafd36d49c1c09c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["devWez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
