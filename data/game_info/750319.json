It was finished in 2011 and translated into English in 2013. It is an original game with special focus on the creation of horror atmosphere. Puzzle-solving elements are also included. Like traditional Japanese horror game, some events need to be triggered by yourself. Obvious hints are not always given. This is to simulate the real-life situation in which sometimes blind-searching is also an important component.</p>\n<p>This game consists of two parts, the main game and the additional game. They were made separately and packed as two individual game files. The main game tells story about Marisa and Konchi&#39;s adventure in a haunted house while the additional game focuses on the story behind the screen. Who is the one really being saved? Who is the one still seeking redemption? These questions may be the true puzzles that you need to solve. As a result, you are encouraged to clear the main game before processing to the additional game.</p>\n<p>The average playtime may range from one hour to two hours for the main game, and fifteen minutes to half an hour for the additional part. There is only one end for the main game, and one end for the additional game. Hints will be uploaded later in the blog here since you may really need one of them to clear the additional game.</p>\n<p>This game contains horror elements and bloody scenes which may cause uncomfortable feeling to players. As a result, this game is only recommended to players above 15 years old.</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended to play this game with earphones in a quiet and dark room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T16:52:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcf/dcf6dd13c9e6bbe2f5356f7013ada756.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/6469/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
