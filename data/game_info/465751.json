It's barely a game but hopefully an interesting experiment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can. You control the yellow cylinder. The red spheres are chasing you. If one touches you, it's game over. They are faster than you, so you must dash away with your\u00a0spacebar. You have three dashes. After your third dash your controls switch to controlling all the enemies at once. After a few seconds the controls switch back. Still don't let them touch the yellow cylinder.</p>\n<p>That's it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Post your best time in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb2/eb224c2740479c413490114e8ce2db1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["QuincyTRG"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
