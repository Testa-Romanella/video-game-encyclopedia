Take on the role of Rex Basil, a conscripted officer-in-training as he navigates this perilous period of history that will eventually become known as the Imperator's Wars.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 On your side is a rag-tag band of B-list soldiers that'll have to use their brains to survive. Use powerful spells and items to set yourself up with terrain bonuses, hinder the opponent, and even destroy the fabric of spacetime.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Against you is a mechanized army invading your homeland, the political drama of Imperial nobility, and a dash of popular unrest.</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- 9 maps (so far) + 2 bonus levels</p>\n<p>- Bonus objectives (some obvious, some hidden)</p>\n<p>- 22 chemical status effects that interact with each other</p>\n<p>- 14 playable characters (so far) each with a unique set of spells/skills and upgradeable weapons to give them their own niches (though there's some overlap and contingencies, because when they die, they're gone for good.)</p>\n<p>- Permadeath</p>\n<p>- Likely a few uncaught bugs (please report them to me)</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the first act of the story is present in a rough draft. This constitutes the prologue and first 8 chapters for 4 - 9 hours of gameplay. (Heavily dependent on how thoroughly bonus objectives are pursued.)</p>\n<p>The soundtrack was assembled from a variety of sources and is by no means final. If there is input on what does or does not work there, I'm listening.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T08:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61cba4a1ef0f2727af7d04785781e7c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiffany Alexanderson"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
