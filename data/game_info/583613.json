The forest not far away from Svec\u012b\u0161u city is corrupted. The creature had been summoned by an unknown group of cultists. We call it the Scarecrow. If you want to survive until tomorrow then try to do the following tasks: Find the items to cast the clensing spell - Candles, knife, cross, spell scroll and Holy Water, if you can count then that's 5 items you need. Find the old cabin the cultists used to corrupt this place and use it as a space for clensing this cursed forest. Good luck.</em>\"<br/></p>\n<p>Scarecrow CO-OP 2 is a sequel to the first game of the same name, aiming to improve on every aspect as well as add new features to ease access and make an overall better experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently, the game is in alpha.
