It says that [insert name here].dll is missing</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> See the important notes above. Your computer probably misses one of the necessary Windows component.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The game doesn't start at all, with no error message displaying</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> In case you have this problem, it could be an issue with the default resolution saved in the default option file. To fix this, open the game folder, open the <strong>config</strong> folder and delete the file named <strong>options.ini</strong>, then restart the game. This way, you will force the game to create a new option file and detect the correct screen resolution.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The game goes down to really low FPS on my laptop</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> By default, Windows runs the game with the integrated graphic card. Try right clicking the .exe to start it with the dedicated graphic card. If this does not help, go into the game settings and lower the graphics settings (resolution, post-processing, etc.)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The game makes my graphic card's fan fly!</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> You can limit the frame rate in the graphic options to either 60, 120 or 144fps. This will most likely solve your graphic card fan issues, by limiting the rendered frames per second.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The game's audio doesn't work</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> This is a weird issue affecting some Windows PC. I solved it by running the game as Administrator, but I am not sure on what can be the cause of it. Rebooting my PC worked for solving the issue, though.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there any known bug / issue?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> There is a known bug involving DirectX12. If you happen to have no view of the battle screen aside from the HUD while starting a match (i.e. black screen), dowload the <strong>DirectX9 Redistributable</strong> from Microsoft website (link) and install it on your PC. After this intervention, the game will run smoothly.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: the game does not recognize my input / I can't get past the title screen</strong><br/><strong>A:\u00a0</strong>The most likely culprit is VJoy. Disable it to make the game work http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/77-vjoy/102-removing-vjoy. If you don't have VJoy installed, then you have a \"phantom joypad\" somewhere. Try to find it and disable it going to Control Panel &gt; Devices and Printers.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I can't take a screenshot with Print in fullscreen mode</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> If you have Windows 10, use the command combination <strong>Win + Alt + Print</strong>. Otherwise, there's no obvious solution :/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: At some point, the game becomes irresponsive in windowed / borderless window mode</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> The window lost focus. Just click on it with your mouse to activate it again.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there local any local multiplayer?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, both with split-keyboard (very uncomfortable) or joypad + keyboard.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will there be online multiplayer?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> You can use Parsec, at the moment - though online multiplayer is not officially planned.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T12:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b75e11213482efdfd6e1e005bf9b05da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["der Mondhase"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
