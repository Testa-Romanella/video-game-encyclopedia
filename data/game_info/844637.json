Stylized<br/><br/><strong>What platform is your game build for?</strong><br/>Windows<br/><br/><strong>Description:</strong><br/>The idiom \"fish out of water\" represents feeling uncomfortable in one's environment. Our puffer fish is unable to thrive in it's environment due to fear or in this case, the wrong water source. We want our environment to mirror the human experience (as above, so below) to show that we often experience situations or challenges that we are uncomfortable with but through the right mindset or method, the impossible becomes attainable.<br/><br/><strong>Number Player:</strong><br/>1</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instruction:</strong><br/>Hold the jump button down to charge your jump.
