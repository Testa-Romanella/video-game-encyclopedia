The player has to save items of personal value from the flames and navigate through a maze of rooms, all the while avoiding firefighters that are out to save your skin (but not your stuff!)</p><p>Each level has a set of items that have to be saved to complete the level. However, for the special badge, you have to save all items. And once you have done that, you can always try to improve your time.</p><p>The game focuses on speed and humor. The graphics are inspired by the classic 1950s style of animation, while the music is produced on 80s vintage analog synthesizers. Combine that with quick-finger gameplay, and you have a unique gaming experience.</p><p>If you're interested in buying the full game, go to our website and purchase it with the Humble widget.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7f86691afd709cfdfcef5ec6f9f8883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aware Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
