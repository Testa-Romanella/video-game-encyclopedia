{"id": 490125, "slug": "snakepong", "name": "Snakepong", "name_original": "Snakepong", "description": "<p>Snakepong is a multiplayer party/action game based loosely on Pong. Except the paddles are snakes. And you can move anywhere on your side of the field. And you can rotate. And you can catch the ball in your mouth and throw it out at high speeds. And there are powerups. And there are random events that can do a whole bunch of crazy stuff like send a mongoose out to eat the snakes or rotate the arena. So essentially it's chaos in every corner. The game has local and online multiplayer as well as a singleplayer campaign. Have fun!</p>\n<p>This game isn't in its final form, but development is on hold for now.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9dbcd7d52022fb362889da2a84bfdd87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
