It is more of a demo than a release, actually. It includes most of the finished game mechanics, screens and menus and a full Level to try out.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The controls of the game are not that hard to find out and so is the goal of the game.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>I invite you to try it out and attempt to figure stuff out on your own.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I intent on uploading two versions of the game, the original one\u00a0for android and a second one playable on windows.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Almost all of the graphic and sound assets of the game were acquired with free licenses\u00a0over the internet. Check the credits screen on the main menu for more information for each one of them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For any questions about the game or me, please feel free to contact me, as I'll be happy to answer.\u00a0I will be obliged if you let me know of any bugs, crashes or aspects of the game that are not quite that good.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have Fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552706e044a58286b75e9878c990ff8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Gears&Colors"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
