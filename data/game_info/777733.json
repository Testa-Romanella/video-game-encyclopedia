That's pretty much all there is to this.</p>\n<p>This build stars PeanutButterGamer (PBG for short). The only two areas here include Purple Plains and Sweet Shores, and the only enemies (none of which do anything) are Lunch Boxers, pirate sharks, and a boss called Gillbeard.</p>\n<p>This is as all this build has to offer, and I don't plan on adding anything else to it.</p>\n<p>Also, I included the project files for anyone who wanted to look behind the scenes of Tuber Quest.</p>\n<p>By the way, while you're still reading the description, go check out MatPat's latest video. It's a really good video that discusses how indie games can be influenced by fan theories for the better or the worse. I will keep this video in mind whenever I develop indie games with secret lore within them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd901709fe0c04b8e14c3fe706268ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew McGee"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
