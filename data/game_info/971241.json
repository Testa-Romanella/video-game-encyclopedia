Maze Escape: (3 v 1) Three mortals must collect the required number of shards to summon the portal &amp; escape, while a monster seeks to stop or kill them before the time expires. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. Shard Mayhem: Monsters only mode. 4 players compete against one another in a free for all to collect the most shards in the time limit provided. Shards spawn in waves and can be stolen from other players by attacking or killing them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n3. Soul Collection: 4 Mortals compete for shards in order to save their own soul.
