I spent a few months polishing the game and improving the enemies after this release, however, I ended up losing all of that work because my backups were not running and I deleted the local data. This build is all that's left of the game.</p><p>I don't think I can put myself through remaking the game. I thought some people would enjoy this quick VR demo.</p><p>The amazing music is by Ben Burnes.</p><p>For updates on my latest projects, follow me on Twitter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6be/6be6d12690fb8bf52081d65b1cbca751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CJKinni"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
