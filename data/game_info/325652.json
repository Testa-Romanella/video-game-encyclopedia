{"id": 325652, "slug": "dear-anne", "name": "Dear Anne", "name_original": "Dear Anne", "description": "<p>{Dear Anne} is my first ever rpg, created as I was experimenting with RPG Maker VX Ace Lite. It is based on a poem I wrote about an unnamed fictional protagonist &amp; a lady named Anne. Telling you any more would be a plot spoiler, so it's best if you play this game cold, keep an open mind &amp; piece together what exactly is going on for yourself (hint: pay attention to the dialogue &amp; your in-game surroundings but I promise, everything will be explained at the end). There are also puzzle elements besides the main mystery involving the plot. Trigger warnings include sudden noises &amp; flashing lights. Use the arrow buttons to move &amp; the Enter key to interact with people, objects or doors. Good luck &amp; hope you enjoy this little game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T16:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89ceacb6e8e515a9b833620dd7fc1063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
