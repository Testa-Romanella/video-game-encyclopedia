It is designed to be played, and won in a single sitting. The main feature of this 8-bit game is the giant monsters. The original 1985 console does not allow monsters to be very big. So, we made the monsters background images and moved them instead! This was a popular trick in classic NES games... and I always wanted to figure out how to do it. By flickering the background, we could make hitting the enemy look and feel good. It took a lot of trial and error. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Pixels: Clarion</li><li>Chiptunes: Jongaar</li><li>Code: The Ultimate Gilby (Gilbert Vera)</li><li>Design/Code: Artix</li></ul>\n<p>Completing this concept in the short window of the Game Jam was really challenging... and super satisfying.\u00a0Hope you enjoy it!
