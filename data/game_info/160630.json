Hope you find this game interesting as well.</p>\n<p>2 players will face each other in a best-of-3 format in this game. In each stage the objects will respond differently to collisons and reflect lasers in a different manner. Try it out yourself and find out the best strategy for each stage.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Red Player: WASD to move, JK to rotate, space to shoot.<br/>Blue Player: arrow keys to move, 78to rotate, 0 to shoot.<br/>All number keys are numpad keys. All movements are relative to the spaceship.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Images and Template code provided by NYU.</p>\n<p>Abandoned Space by Artofescapism\u00a0 \u00a0http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Artofescapism/Sound_Forest_Atmospheric_Tracks/...</p>\n<p>blast sound by Mike Koenig<br/>http://soundbible.com/538-Blast.html</p>\n<p>Mirror Breaking Sound by Mike Koenig<br/>http://soundbible.com/1658-Mirror-Breaking.html</p>\n<p>Everything else: Haotian Shen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed228218b6c0c0fe926415d8c865664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sparK1N9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
