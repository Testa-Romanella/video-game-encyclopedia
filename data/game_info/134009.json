As the game starts, you are riding Space Highway 8 (The Ocho) to your home planet Glork.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYour mortal foe, the evil Dr. Mister Asshat (PhD), doesn't want you to get home, because home is where the heart is, and Dr. Asshat is a heartless asshole. Dr. Asshat has devised a most cunning plan to kill you and your entire fleet. By placing colored walls and obstacles along the entire length of The Ocho, he has rendered it a hellish obstacle course from hell. And while you, the commander of the Harlem Spacetrotters, are busy matching colors and avoiding obstacles, Dr. Asshat is constantly sending enemy ships to shoot down your teammates.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYour enemies, from the planet Rhythmix, must do everything in a rhythmic fashion whenever there is music playing, and to your chagrin there is always music playing on Space Highway 8. This means that both the obstacles and the enemy attacks will happen at the same time, on the beats of the playing music. If you fail an obstacle you will also fail to give your fleet the proper attack commands, resulting in you loosing a teammate. You must get to the end of Space Highway 8 without loosing your entire fleet.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMove left and right with the arrow keys, or the mouse, and jump with the spacebar to dodge oncoming boxes.
