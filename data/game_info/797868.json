Share your creations code with the rest of the world in the comments and try out others creations.</p>\n<p>Controls are explained in the game and a general overview of how the mechanics work can be seen in the game page's images below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/48564f2681c3ca889b871a213bea99cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MetaArcade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
