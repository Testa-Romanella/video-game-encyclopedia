I made this project for a game jam, the Mini Jam 78. A game jam is when you have only a certain amount of time to make a game submit it and view your rank among the jam. The theme of the jam was \"Bugs\". You also had to make a limitation and they stated the limitation as \"a special condition that your game must follow, but is open to interpretation\". The limitation was that the main character had to be the bad guy.\u00a0 https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-78-bugs</p>\n\n<p>THE BUGS:</p>\n<p>https://www.deviantart.com/deviantwear/journal/New-8-Bit-deviantWEAR-Design-Chal...</p>\n<p>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/295971006769762258/</p>\n<p>https://www.123rf.com/photo_156124786_stock-vector-ant-bug-insect-pixel-art-vide...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T06:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a2bf4f8eba49441b504f27b3a2215d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zianz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
