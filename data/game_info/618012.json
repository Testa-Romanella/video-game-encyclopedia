At first, everyone's excited; it seems great, enough space, clean air, beautiful horizons. What's not to like?</p>\n<p>X\u039eKONYX wasn't pleased, however. They weren't gaining enough profit off this. Sure, there was marketing everywhere. But it just didn't sit right with the company's mindset. To solve this, they released drones all around the city, in order to spy on the civilians... maybe that could leave them a fat-stack of cash on the side.</p>\n<p>You've been tasked to defeat the drones in X\u039eKINO. Using your tether, fight against the drones and rid the city of this evil!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming - Primed Pixel / Malachy Moran-Tun<br/></p>\n<p>Music - Primed Pixel / Malachy Moran-Tun</p>\n<p>SFX - Kenney https://kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Art -\u00a0ansimuz\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-city</p>\r\nGMTK Jam 2021 Stuff\r\n<p>All code was programmed during the jam. The first music track was fully composed and mixed during the jam, whereas the second was not.</p>\n<p>This game is local multiplayer, meaning it requires two players at the same computer. However, it is possible to use GMTogether to play online! This is\u00a0<strong>not</strong> necessary for the game to function. Luckily, it is free (unless you want the Steam version, which rids the need of port forwarding)</p>\n<p>https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmtogether</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4b76fdd61cd2bd7e9f1f8a3af78fe7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Primed Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
