Luna Here :3</p><p>*Hint* Opposite Sides of a Dice always add up to 7.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my little Dice Puzzle game i made in 48h during the GMTK Game Jam 2022!</p>\n<p>There are 5 little puzzles which u can solve. Sadly due to time limits i couldn't make more complex puzzle mechanics and I think that those 5 Levels already use the whole complexity. I might expand it in the future tho. <br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave suggestions of improvements and additions to the game!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>All in all I'm pretty pleased with this one. This is my third game and i can feel the speed of the development process ramping up which is very exciting. I could use my Mesh creation knowledge I learned during my last project which i sadly wasn't able to finish in time.<br/></p>\n<p>Things to add in the future, maybe.</p>\n<p>- More Puzzle mechanics eg. moving platforms or doors or maybe a even something that mirrors the dice who knows-</p>\n<p>- A level Selections Screen.</p>\n<p>- A Main Menu :3<br/></p>\n<p>- Change up the appearance of the whole game eg. making the platform 3 Dimensional and adding some textures and decorations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/767b433cfa2de884420643b1a4b615ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wuffli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
