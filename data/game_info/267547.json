Are you a weird guy or geek or friki?<br/>This application will solve your problem and change your life: It is your virtual synthetic girlfriend and lives on your mobile device. She is realistic and is in 3d, with twists and poses.<br/>Take care of she as if were real, give it pampering, you are an otaku of love.<br/>It has its basic needs, so you should feed and take care of.<br/>You also have to feed her and take her to her room to sleep, so she will recharge the batteries for you. She is not a virtual pet, she is a lot of machine code that runs in the software layer of your device, so she has no feelings.<br/>You have a store where you can buy dresses and accessories so you can be happier (she does not care).<br/>The coins for the store can be earned in the minigames, watching advertising videos or paying real money if you are in a hurry.<br/>You can also change some aspects of the character, such as hair and skin color.<br/>It is the most beautiful virtual girl that exists in cyberspace, it has taken me months to create such a sweet face.<br/>Capture images and share them with your friends, they will thank you. You have a button to make screenshots that hides the menu items.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/188dc3b0c8a252b2edfe515fefb8f6fe.jpg", "website": "http://akrasoft.es", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Francisco Javier Perez"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Francisco Javier Perez"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
