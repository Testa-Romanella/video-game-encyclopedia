{"id": 891233, "slug": "professor-of-magical-studies", "name": "Professor of Magical Studies", "name_original": "Professor of Magical Studies", "description": "Professor of Magical Studies is an interactive magical school novel by Stephen Granade, where your choices control the story. It\u2019s entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou\u2019re a professor of magical studies, specializing in pattern magic. When magical practitioners study special patterns, they reshape their minds to turn the potential energy between dimensions into magical energy and shape the world to their will.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are risks, of course. Practitioners are configuring their minds in non-human ways, and there\u2019s a limit to how much your mind can bounce back from that. Then there are the self-aware, intelligent creatures in other dimensions who can also perform magic. Sometimes, when you channel magic, one of these creatures can cross over and takes up residence in the practitioner\u2019s mind...your mind. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut the risks are worth it. You\u2019ve been invited to join the faculty at Winfield Phillips College as a last-minute hire to replace a vanished professor. Winfield Phillips doesn\u2019t have a graduate program, but it does have sharp undergrads who are natural fodder for your research. Now you have to balance your own magical research with a teaching load, your students\u2019 needs, and your goal to become the youngest tenured faculty member the Winfield Phillips has ever had. That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t give up and go work for Repro, the company that would love to have your magic research. Oh, and then there\u2019s the Vastness, and those incomprehensible cross-dimensional beings who are drawn to magic use and who might just destroy the Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Winfield Phillips\u2019s most junior magical faculty member.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T02:58:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b54777e61dcc032503cad0a1b7aef6c.jpg", "website": "https://www.choiceofgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Choice of Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choice of Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
