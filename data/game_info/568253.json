I think it is pretty fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made\u00a0<em>The majestic game of knights and cultists</em> in 72 Hours for Wowie Jam 2021. It is by far the most complete game\u00a0I have made in a Game Jam. It has 27 collectible cards, each with unique art and an associated rarity. It also has 28 playable enemies. I am very proud of myself right now for getting so far into development of this game!</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb4/cb48b63bd98bedefe5595b3b65cec403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spydercrawler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
