As such, some yandere traits are discussed (though briefly) in the story. The story also involves frequent coarse language, as the main character curses a lot in his internal narration.<br/><br/></p>\n<p> Mamiya Hibiki is a regular guy with not so regular interests. He\u2019s a huge fan of the decade-old drama series <em>Possessive Boyfriends</em>, and his favourite character by far is Kirisaki Shin: a deranged yandere who expresses his love with continuous threats of entrapment, torture, and murder.\r\n<br/><br/>  Hibiki\u2019s dull corporate job is a draining one, and to make his commutes to work less unbearable, he takes to listening to Shin\u2019s dulcet tones on the train in the early hours of the morning. The highest form of self-care, for Hibiki, comes in the form of fantasising about Shin, his beloved,\u00a0brutally murdering him\u2026\r\n<br/><br/>  But the real world soon encroaches on his harmless(?) fantasies, when a scuffle on the train results in his headphone jack coming unplugged from his phone.<br/><br/>In an instant, Shin\u2019s murderous expressions of <em>amour</em> are broadcast to the rest of the train: including a smug older man Hibiki takes to calling \u2018that bastard\u2019, who finds the whole debacle <em>incredibly </em>amusing.<br/><br/>Hibiki might enjoy fictional characters threatening to kill him, but he\u2019s far less receptive about real men teasing him about these desires.<br/><br/>That\u2019s what Hibiki thinks, at least \u2013 until he runs into his silver-tongued tormentor yet again, and things start to get serious\u2026</p>\n<p>- 16k worth of text (approx 40-60 mins of reading)<br/>- A kinetic story with no choices/branches<br/>- Original character artwork<br/>- Banter<br/>- Hibiki's wet, see-through shirt<br/>- A light, comedic romance story<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Story/programming: ebi-hime<br/>Character art: Ayanobro<br/>Additional art: Renmiou<br/>Background art: Minikle, Z<br/>UI: Elduator<br/>Music: Amachamusic, Music Material<br/>Phone code: Nighten</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb17c302d412a1ea8561bda2a9d58c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ebi-hime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
