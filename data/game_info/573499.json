Coins made of a variety of metals</p>\n<p>have found a home in the hearts and minds of the general public. Banks are</p>\n<p>still the institutes first associated with financial activities of course,</p>\n<p>and The First Planetary Bank is no exception.</p>\n<p>This is where Marvin is employed. He is only a 17th class android, but he</p>\n<p>is ambitious. Besides electronic sheep, he dreams of one day becoming a 1st</p>\n<p>class android. You can help him achieve this. Using a special branch, found</p>\n<p>in a nearby forest one day, jab the various coins in the correct deposit</p>\n<p>boxes, as they fall from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Every time you sort a coin correctly, you class rating increases. Besides</p>\n<p>that, Marvin moves up one position, making it harder to sort the next coin.</p>\n<p>However, if you make one mistake or if you have reached 1st class status,</p>\n<p>then you are finished and get an evaluation.</p>\n<p>To use the stick, press:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"S\" to jab softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"H\" to jab hard.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to achieve a 1st class rating, by sorting</p>\n<p>the coins correctly.
