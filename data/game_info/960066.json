How will Lumis defeat the enemies even if she can't attack?<br/>The way Lumis defeats the enemies is through reflection sorcery. You can damage the enemy by reflecting the enemy's attack at the right moment.<br/><br/>In the battle, enemy attacks are represented by a skill cursor, which looks like a magic circle. At the center of the battle screen, there is an area called a marker. When the skill cursor is just over the marker, press the button for a successful reflection. The game is designed in the style of a rhythm game, in which the player parries the movement of the skill cursor to move in various ways, such as straight lines, curves, waves, and rotations.<br/><br/>Also, there is not only one button to press but three different buttons. The enemies use three types of attacks: blows, slashes, and magic, so press the button corresponding to each attack to reflect them.<br/><br/><strong>Sorcery</strong><br/>In addition to reflection sorcery, Lumis can also use sorcery to advance the battle. Such as,<br/><br/><ul><li> Reflective damage is reduced but slows down the enemy's attack.<br/></li><li> Reduces HP by half but increases reflective damage<br/></li><li> Automatically reflect all enemy attacks for one turn, but reflective damage becomes a little</li></ul><br/>These consume MP, but many of them have more powerful effects.<br/><br/><strong>Characters</strong><br/>This game uses Live2D, so the characters move vividly in conversation and battle scenes! Especially in conversation scenes, the characters' expressions change in detail, making the story more enjoyable.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T05:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2a98be783129aff1e3ddd14855b59cb.jpg", "website": "https://ateliernever.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atelier Never"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Atelier Never"], "esrb_rating": null}
