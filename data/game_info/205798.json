The theme was \"A game where you mine ore from cloud cities in the name of love.\" The concept of mining was implemented, lacking a proper storyline, yet one could easily see that the topic is fitting.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is straightforward : Use the arrow keys to dig down within two minutes,\u00a0destroying as many blocks as possible and avoid getting crushed along the way !<br/></p>\n<p>More content is scheduled already, but due to the Jam scope and timeline has been excluded from this prototype version. For your entertainment... I present you with Block Bottom !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f2/6f2440adeb35a3bed83460cef5284fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JavaSaurus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
