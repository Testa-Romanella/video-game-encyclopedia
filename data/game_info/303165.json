Return to a time of peace.</p>\n<p>I'm new to using Bitsy software. When I realized that its limits were also its greatest strength, I took advantage of mostly the artistic portion of the game. I wanted to add more detail to the game but I found it very time consuming to create it with precision. After, exploring the aspects of Bitsy, I decided to make this game a prototype to the Unity version I will be creating in the near future.<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted the game to be modern-based so I began by creating city-like structures and machinery. Once I had my environment, I added key sprites and components into the game that gave it an interactive feel. I didn't have time to extend the game. This prototype is meant to get a feel for what players like. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a75d77a7128f9e1a4103a052504388c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["xxldraco"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
