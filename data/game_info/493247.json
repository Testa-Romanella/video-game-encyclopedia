They're holding up the town's police station demanding you come forward or and set the\u00a0<br/>kingpin free.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, you are killed (but the game does give you a choice on how you hande the situation when you finally arrive.<br/>After being shot to death, the main character is bought back to life as a cyborg. He has a jetpack and a beefy gun\u00a0<br/>(however I don't think this part is playably in this version of the game).</p>\n<p>I might upload a later version of it which features more of the cyborg gameplay.</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy this version of Super Cyborg Space Commando, the game that never was.</p>\n<p>kind regards,<br/>TheAfterWorld</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0de/0dedc0190bae5b2be198de423cdce35d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAfterWorld"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
