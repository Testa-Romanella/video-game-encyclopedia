Now that he's awakened to its senses, he must escape the planet, even if that means killing his brainwashed teammates!</p>\n<p>Although the game is not complete and this is just a demo, I hope you enjoy it! This was a solo project I did back in the summer of 2019, now releasing it for everyone to 'give it a shot' (heh)</p>\n<p>TIPS AND HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<ul><li>Your objective is to kill your enemies and survive for the whole level's duration, plain and simple.</li><li>Move with W, A, S, D.</li><li>Aim with your mouse and shoot with the left click.</li><li>Do barrel rolls with either shift or space.</li><li>If your shields drop down to 0, you lose.</li><li>If you crash into anything, you lose (watch out!)</li></ul>\n<p>Now you're ready to go!</p>\n<p>PD: Can you beat my personal record? It's 17600 points. If you do, let me know! :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:40:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/475/475ee5fe8b4b9f28237927226bd4ab83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G-76"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
