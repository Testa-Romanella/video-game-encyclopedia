The creatures seem confused and kind of dumb, each floor is a strange jumble of makeshift rooms, corridors, and impractically placed walls, and there's no tutorial in sight!</em> <em>You must use what resources you can to stop this evil before it sinks its roots into The Creator's free time and extracts the precious artifact, \"More Content\".<br/></em></p>\n<p>Gim Descent is a turn-based rogue-like dungeon-crawler.<br/>The aim is to fight through a dungeon and defeat a boss on floor 12.<br/>How far can you get?<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Arrow keys/WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Z - open inventory / select</p>\n<p>X - close menus</p>\n<p>Plus / Minus - Zoom in and out (useful for when you're trying to find where to go)</p>\n<p>Escape - Return to main menu / exit</p>\n<p>The game saves automatically, so no worries on that front.</p>Source Code<p>https://github.com/Hamezii/Gim-Descent</p>\r\nProgress\r\n<p>So far there are 3 different playable characters and around 9 or 10 different types of enemies, but I'm adding more! For now I am focusing on creating a game where emergent game play can come from the interactions between systems (e.g. Throwing a teleport potion against a wall to clear a path). <br/></p>\n\n<p>I hope you can follow me during my journey as I continue to improve Gim Descent.
