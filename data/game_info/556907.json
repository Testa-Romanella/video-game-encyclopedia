{"id": 556907, "slug": "swirl-watch", "name": "Swirl Watch", "name_original": "Swirl Watch", "description": "<p>Deep within the pressure-hell of resource rich gas giants, the Floatoid Swirl Watch patrols the field-stabilized zones to keep pirates at bay and refinery installations save.</p>\n<p>Swirl Watch is a top-down space-combat game where stealth and detection play a key role. Your opponent's can't detect you unless you emit engine or weapon noise, but you won't be able to see them as well unless you ping them with active sonar.</p>\n\n<p>Play with your prey as you both slip in and out of stealth, ambush unsuspecting ships with a precision strikes, drift past swarms of missiles while silent running or go loud and engage contacts head on with missile barrages. But make sure to keep your cargo ships and installations save, else they'll need to spend your earned salvage on repairs instead of making ship upgrades for you. <br/></p>\n<p>The original version was made in 48 hours or Global Game Jam 2021. (The theme was lost and found.) The Redux version was released a week after and added player missile, level progression, the upgrade system as well as a final challenge and ending to the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Features (Redux)</strong><br/>-Top down detection-based combat with flashy visuals<br/>-Sonar and sound propagation system that governs how and if ships can see another<br/>-2 ship weapons that allow to tackle combat situations in various ways<br/>-Over 20 ship upgrades that allow for different builds<br/>-4 different zones that have you travel from an icy orbit down to the gas-giants burning core<br/>-Various enemy types with rapidly increasing challenge in later levels<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/> </p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Pro Tips</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Your sonar pulse has less \"resolution\" the further it travels. Repeated scans might be necessary to make sure a vector is clear if you are looking for something far away.</li><li>Torpedoes will stop tracking you the moment you go quiet and instead swivel towards your last known position. Each torpedo has an X that marks it's current destination.</li><li>Sector names go alphabetical from left to right and increase numerically from top to bottom. Use this in conjunction with reports from friends to ambush enemies.</li><li>You will loose salvage if cargo friends are destroyed or the installation takes too much damage. Less salvage means fewer upgrades, so keep them save.</li><li>Accordingly, make sure you identify contacts before blasting them. Missile launches and other weapon activity is a dead giveaway that something is hostile though.</li><li>A full missile barrage is enough to destroy a skiff, but requires the target to be fully identified in order to lock on. Moving targets need to be tracked with sonar to update missile targeting.</li><li>The railgun can fire at things you can't see and will even deal double damage if your target is detected but you are not.</li><li>Exploring the hazard zone beyond the bouys can sometimes pay off.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T07:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcdef3293205cd63743ca8bd7189e7cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["sleeper_games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
