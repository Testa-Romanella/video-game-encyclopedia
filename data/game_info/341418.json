Simple RPG Maker game, no fancy mechanics. Team up with friends, or go at it alone! Which\r\n  approach gives you the most benefits? That's the kind of character you play. <strong>Three different endings!</strong>\r\n  Ooooh aaaahh.\r\n  <p>\r\n    3 week game jam, ~65 hours of effort, and maybe 15 minutes of game play. The dialogue is in a really really rough\r\n    draft state, in some cases it even has a description instead of an exchange, haha. Super fun making it though, hope\r\n    somebody gets some entertainment out of it. Still lacking in a lot of ways, and hope to polish up a future version\r\n    post-game jam.\r\n    <br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nWishlist Stuff\r\n<p>I'm posting this about 4 hours before the submission. This is more so for a future release in which I'll setup a\r\n  separate project page. In somewhat of a priority:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Music (Halfheartedly selected right now)</li>\n<li>Improve the Action Sequences</li>\n<li>Custom Art Portraits</li>\n<li>Improve the Maps</li>\n<li>Add more content to the Game, and event branching</li>\n<li>More actions for rewards</li>\n<li>Proper Dialogue</li>\n<li>Proper character names</li>\n<li>Other things I'm surely not thinking of right now...</li>\n<li>Clean up the menus and interface</li>\n</ul>\r\nTechnical Stuff\r\n\r\n  Game is just under 60mb, please be patient as it loads.\r\n  <br/>\r\n  Game options allow you to reconfigure your controller mapping (if you use a controller).\r\n\r\n<p>On a controller, R1/Right Trigger1 will skip text by default.<br/>On a keyboard skip text is Page Down by default.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Candacis - Tilesets</p>\r\nPlugins\r\n<p>Yanfly Engine \u2013 Tons of plugins<br/>HimeWorks \u2013 Actor Battle Command Plugin<br/>Altimit \u2013 Pixel Movement\r\n  Plugin<br/>waynee95 \u2013 Plugin<br/>Caethril \u2013 RPG Maker MV Forums \u2013 Yanfly Event Chase Stealth Fix</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>\r\n  Music Licensed Under Creative Commons\r\n  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  Untitled PVC Quena_JA rearrange by naotko feat.
