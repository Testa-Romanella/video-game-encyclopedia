Pressing 1-6 will select the home star of each \"player\". (You're player 1)<br/></strong><br/>The\u00a0 original intent was to let ships build up in your star system(s) and then shoot them to new stars Angry Birds-style. If other \"fleets\" end up in the same system, they would randomly fight Risk-style.<br/></p>\n<p>This is now what should have been Day 2's version, if I hadn't broken it after midnight. The \"left-click select\" now only selects systems you control, and since I didn't get the \"send ships\" finished, you only control one. As a compromise, I added a temporary input to select the different players to jump around more.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65922dfbed7ccef8d986f5aa2ead284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["karlgg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
