You soon realize that there is a force unlike anything you've ever seen rotting under the master's bed.<br/><br/><strong>Your Weapon</strong><br/><br/>Your only weapon against the creatures of the night is a flashlight. Bash and burn your enemies until the sun rises on a new day. But be careful: the flashlight has limited battery life, you will need to shake it to recharge it. Make sure you are able to spend precious time doing so.<br/><br/><strong>The Creatures of the Night</strong><br/><br/>Toys and clothes by day, but by night they are corrupted by the darkness of the master's nightmares.
