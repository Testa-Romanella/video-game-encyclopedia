(4 levels still in development and are not complete but stay tuned for more harder levels to make the game challenging).<br />\nControl Sonic and collect the coins to advance to the next level!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Notice: THE GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND THERE IS ONLY ONE LEVEL AT THE MOMENT, SO AFTER FINISHING IT THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BASICALLY. POST YOUR COMMENTS WITH POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES ABOUT THE GAME AND HELP ME MAKE THE GAME BETTER! THE LEVELS ARE TESTED, SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO FINISH IT.<br />\nPS. This is the\u00a0first game I&#39;ve ever made!
