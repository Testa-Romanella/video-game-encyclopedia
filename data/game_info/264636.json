This game isn't functional, but it gives you an idea of my initial game plan/idea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prototype #2- SpaceHammy</strong></p>\n<p>The player is a hamster with the ability to control the gravity. The player will be able to float up and down, but be careful,\u00a0 changing the\u00a0gravity\u00a0 affects the objects around you. If an object touches you, you will POSITIVELY DIE! Hamsters and furniture's are not\u00a0a great mix.</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype\u00a0 #3- SpaceMan</strong></p>\n<p>The space man's mission is to collect all 4 cards on the screen while\u00a0 avoiding\u00a0 the alien chasing\u00a0\u00a0you. Collecting all the cards is your secret weapon to annihilate all alien existences. After collecting all the cards, you must get REVENGE on the alien, and kill him before he escapes.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype #4 - SpaceBoom</strong><br/></p>\n<p>On earth we have \"Sonic Boom\" ( the sound that is associated with the shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound). In space we have \"Space\u00a0Boom\". Use your powerful voice to shoot the enemies coming towards you.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d57/d570d7231256c28b2fbc6688c0637b40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Experimental Game Design"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
