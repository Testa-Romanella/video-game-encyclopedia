Players must choose a side and fight till the bloody end, battling it out in a variety of locales. With a wide list of fearless characters, players can decide between the quick-witted and talented Slayers or the demons of the night themselves, the Vampires.<br/><br/><br/>As a Vampire, use Blood Vision to track Slayers, invisibility to hunt or escape, and jump or leap at great distances. Slayers can use telekinetic powers to push vampires away when crowded, cite a prayer to protect you from evil, and much more. Learn to master every character, each of which comes with its own unique weapons and abilities<br/><br/><br/>Players will be able to duke it out on several maps which vary in size and style, from an evacuated, bloody subway station to a cold, terrifying cemetery.
