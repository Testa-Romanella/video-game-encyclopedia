During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them but can accelerate them. When five or more same-color pieces are in a row, column, or diagonal, they disappear, and the pieces placed above fall.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCompleting elimination gains scores. The player can clear multiple times at once, which can earn bonus scores.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery 20 blocks falling down move the player up a level, the speed of the falling pieces increases with each level, leaving the player with less time to think about the placement.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T03:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c6e56ea6755bb53a64cfff26433b00.jpg", "website": "https://huanggaole.itch.io/gobangtetris", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["huanggaole", "Huang Gaole", "Aleksandr Makarov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Huang Gaole"], "esrb_rating": null}
