The first game debuted in 1992 for the PC Engine system. The game&#39;s sequels and spin-offs later appeared on the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, WonderSwan, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Mainly consisting of side-scrolling shoot &#39;em ups in the vein of Gradius, the Cho Aniki series is best known for its homoerotic overtones, wacky humor and vivid, surreal imagery. Most of the games have never seen release outside Japan.<br />\nFor various reasons, the popularity of the Cho Aniki games has endured since the series&#39; debut. Highlights of the various games include in-game music, innovative control schemes or sheer kitsch value. In Japan, these games are examples of baka-ge, a type of kuso-ge. &quot;Baka-ge&quot; literally means &quot;idiot game&quot; while &quot;kuso-ge&quot; literally means &quot;shitty game&quot; or &quot;shit game&quot;. Baka-ge&#39;s appeal lies in its campiness.<br />\nOccasionally, the title is transliterated as &quot;Choaniki&quot;, &quot;Chou Aniki&quot;, or (erroneously) &quot;Cho Eniki&quot;.<br />\nThe rights to the series are currently owned by Extreme Co., Ltd., which had obtained the rights of NCS Corp. and Masaya products and trademarks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T08:56:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1b0/1b0adbd81eb38117e7621d0dd23fc3ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Bits Laboratory"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["NCS"], "esrb_rating": null}
