Showcasing beautifully rendered designs and backgrounds, innovative weaponry, captivating gameplay action, and a cool techno-trance soundtrack, \"SUGURI\" is a must-have, must-play doujin game.<br/><br/>SUGURI is equipped with an automatic lock-on targeting system and equipped with a unique arsenal of hyper weapons, power shields, and more. Sure, she may look cute, but when it's time to fight, it's all business. So, get ready to focus and concentrate like never before, because you're about to fight your way through seven insanely challenging stages, all while going up against overwhelming bosses with deceptive and distracting weapons that fill up the entire screen. You're outnumbered and outgunned, but use your target-locking control system and fire-power wisely and you might just dodge the hundreds of missiles, laser spears and beams coming at you from every direction. Inflict as much damage as you can and you'll have a fighting chance, but get careless for just one split-second and that's all it takes between exhilarating victory and brutal defeat!<br/><br/><strong>Suguri Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> Side-scrolling shoot-\u2019em-up with fighting-game-like boss battles<br/></li><li> Mix and match multiple unlockable weapons<br/></li><li> Charming story with endearing characters <br/></li><li> Steam Cards</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc9/bc99c7becaf7211fa8a5bd14375b9d33.jpg", "website": "http://www.rockinandroid.com/games/gameinfo.php?id=suguri-collection", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 129, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orange_Juice"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rockin Android"], "esrb_rating": null}
