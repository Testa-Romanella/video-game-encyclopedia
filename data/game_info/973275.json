Deflect, empower, manage and solve each map using your creative and strategic mind.<br/><br/><br/>Anx Defense is a mind-bending twist on the Tower Defense genre.<br/>Place various buildings on the path of your projectiles to create your ultimate defense!<br/>Everything comes at a price though and you will need to manage your available gold, space and Mana wisely.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mirrors make the projectiles do a 90\u00b0 turn and they can be hit from both sides.<br/><br/>This unique mechanic offers a lot of creativity when it comes to solving the map's puzzle.<br/>As the game progresses this will become more and more difficult, as you'll have to keep these things in mind:<br/><ul><li> Avoid obstacles<br/></li><li> Cover every monster path<br/></li><li> Reach each path in time<br/></li><li> Projectile should be strong enough while crossing a path</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>A projectile passing through 3 Damage Enhancer and then 3 Speed Enhancer.<br/><br/>Use various Gates to empower your shots!<br/>Enhance damage, speed, piercing or infuse Mana to your projectiles by placing the corresponding building on their way.<br/>You'll also need to build some farm to boost your economy, otherwise you won't be able to make it until the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Projectile passing through a Blue Mana Infuser, a Yellow Mana Infuser and a Damage Enhancer. (with Mana Overlay activated)<br/><br/>Gates will need Mana to activate. Manas are infused to projectiles by passing through Mana Infusers (special buildings).<br/>There are two types of Mana -- Blue and Yellow -- and later on in the game, some Gates will have Mana Conditions. This means that in order to activate, the Mana Levels will need to satisfy some special conditions (for instance, holding more Blue Mana than Yellow Mana).<br/><br/>This mechanic leads to an intricate puzzle of Mana management.<br/>Mana Conditions also change with each level, meaning the Mana management puzzle needs to be re-solved by the player each time.<h3>Campaign &amp; High Scores</h3>The campaign features a list of levels, each with its own map, building restrictions and Mana Conditions. <br/>Each level also comes with up to 3 challenging High Score goals to reach!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T11:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d1074e2d284b405588ec6405530c3892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nocteon Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nocteon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
