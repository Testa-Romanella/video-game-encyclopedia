I have had several people install this on their machines, and the most that happens is that it generates a new txt file called \"load.txt\" when you make a Save file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T15:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/234a474337ecbe0d236fc6653315dcce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["World of Torcorvion"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
