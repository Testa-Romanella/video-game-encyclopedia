Do you hold your keys between your fingers in pre-emptive self-defence?  The fear shown in horror games and films isn't a unique horror \u2014 for many people, it is part of a daily lived reality. Many marginalized people live with a certain kind of fear in their every day lives. Whether this is a fear of getting home safely without being harassed or assaulted with hate speech, or a fear of being alone in their own apartment due to break ins, or even a fear of simply leaving the house.</p>\n<p><em>Lights Out, Please</em> combines retellings of traditional ghost stories and urban legends, alongside new, personal stories from a variety of international authors in order to tell others about the kinds of fears we live with. We tell our stories as a ghost story or urban legend to get people to believe us. </p>\n<p>Headed by Kaitlin Tremblay, <em>Lights Out, Please</em> is a collaborative horror game made in Twine that features 13 interactive short stories written by a diverse group of marginalized writers, including some established gamemakers and some never before published writers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc45f1208e41afb8719cbf3c89276bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaitlin Tremblay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
