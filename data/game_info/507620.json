You collect ingredients and recipes, and use the ingredients to complete recipes. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. In order to do this you have to be selective of the recipes you'll go for and what actions to take and when. Optionally you can add skill cards into the play, which give you bonus points for completing them.</p>\n<p>While the other players cannot directly harm you, they know what you're up to and can choose to meddle with your plans by denying you the cards you'd want, so beware! Let the best baker win!</p>\n<p>Player count: 2-4</p>\n<p>Note: Half\u00a0 the deck for a 2 player game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb8a25eb7c9d871b9620ac10bfd6e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["8BitMuffin", "VilleVieri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
