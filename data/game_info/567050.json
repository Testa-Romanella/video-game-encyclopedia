{"id": 567050, "slug": "your-warm-jacket", "name": "Your Warm Jacket", "name_original": "Your Warm Jacket", "description": "<p>Your Warm Jacket is a game that\u2019s about loneliness and isolation in a cold climate, where the player\u2019s only companion is a cat that lives in their house. This game, while innocent at first, harbors some strange elements that will give the player a sense of unease and things not being right. As a result, the game may feel more like a scary horror experience. This would come from the town being empty aside from one specific individual that you find later that may clue you in to what happens next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why should the player feel uneasy?: Because the town is empty, without a known reason. Emptiness and towns being abandoned rarely happens without reason and the player will grow to know why.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What tells the player that the game isn\u2019t right?: It comes in one particular building where they enter and read a line of dialogue that tells them a bit about the history of the building they\u2019re going into. And how that doesn\u2019t line up with what\u2019s going on right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What else tells them that the game isn't right?: There's a secret to be discovered that reveals the nature of the events that take place in the game. While it isn't too difficult to find it still offers a sense of dread from finding it.\u00a0<br/><br/>Created and written by:\u00a0Jake Reilly</p>\n<p>https://jakereilly20.wixsite.com/jakebuildsgames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:00:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c75907ba7a447ebf9d324b1d1beeefd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mercenary Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
