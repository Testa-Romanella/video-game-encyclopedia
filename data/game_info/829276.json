Out of nowhere, the pipe began leaking a lot of water. As a plumber, you need to contain the water in the pipe or else you will get contained by a lot of water in that room.\u00a0However, the only tool you have is an unlamented amount of empty water bottles. Utilize and contain the water as much as you can.</p>\n<p>The only control is mouse. It's like a point-and-click game. You click and move, while interact at the same time.</p>\n<p>Music obtained from OpenGameArt:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/panic-mode<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T09:03:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f24/f240d1cb53bf68903f303bbff8e2d113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheGamer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
