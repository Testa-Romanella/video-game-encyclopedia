As a result, this release is more of a tech demo than an actual game. Patches to the game that bring more features will be added soon though!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T05:45:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709133eec32509903baa8e6bd99fd0e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PancakeHat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
