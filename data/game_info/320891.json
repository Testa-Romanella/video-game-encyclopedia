This monkey is attached to the players shoulder and is always hungry and needs bananas to eat. The aim of the game is to collect bananas before the monkey gets Hangry(red appearance). Collecting all the bananas will allow a key in the level to be active. Once the key has been collected, the exit door will automatically open, and then the race is on to finish the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa3/fa33010a7075644146bd17b888d5ba27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danielsimonm29"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
