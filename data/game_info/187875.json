You have to go outside and get some. Trouble is, there's evil sheep everywhere and they're jumping all over the place. They're especially keen on kicking you in the head, jumping on top of your head, or just outright demolishing your head.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys to move. The up arrow key jumps, the down arrow key crouches.</li></ul>\n<p>That's all you really know, as I believe the tutorial I kinda implemented can teach you well enough, but if you get confused playing the game later or you want to be prepared for later and know the inner workings of my game, read further.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes you have to jump two tiles high. To do this, you get a walking or running start, jump, and crouch in mid air. This will allow you to jump up two tiles instead of one.</li><li>If you find your self in a space where you need to do a \"duck jump\" but you don't have enough room to get a walking start, jump, walk a little toward the ledge you want to jump on to in mid air, and then crouch.</li><li>To win the game, find the cereal and milk around the map, and then return home.</li><li>If you jump on a sheep's head or kick it in the face, it dies.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>If a sheep lands on your head for any reason or kicks you in the face by jumping into it, you will lose health. If you die, you will respawn back at home moments later.</li><li>If you bump into a sheep but neither one of you seem to be far enough above the other to constitute a face-kick or goomba stomp, you and the sheep will bounce off each other. even if you're in mid air.</li><li>You don't have to goomba stomp sheep for a kill. If you jump into a sheep so that your feet kick it horizontally across the face, it dies.</li><li>The sheep can jump kick you too. Watch out.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2da/2dab0f362c51e7495aecfdbbbbeaaa17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blehmeh98"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
