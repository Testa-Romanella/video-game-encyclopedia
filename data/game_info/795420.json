He admitted that his plan was to sell the cow to get money for food, but a nice man persuaded him to exchange it for beans, which could grow all the way to the clouds, where he could find a magic castle with a golden goose inside that can lay golden eggs.<br/><br/>After you spend the entire evening running through the market in search for this mysterious \u201cnice\u201d man, you came home and sent your little brother to bed without dinner.

I\u2019m going to climb this beanstalk and I will find the magic castle in the clouds and I will find the golden goose and then we will be rich and then you will have to apologize to me for being mad at me!\u201d<br/><br/>So now you will have to climb the beanstalk in order to beat the sh\u2026 in order to save your little brother before he falls down and breaks his neck.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>Your goal in this 3D platformer is to climb to the top of the beanstalk.
