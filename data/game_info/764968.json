Have you ever tried folding the paper? This is my boring idea in class when I was a child. Now it has become a reality! You can go to the other side of the paper maze by folding the paper. You can play random levels, or make levels and upload them to the creative workshop! I hope it reminds you of the fun of childhood<br/>\r\n-moving target<br/>\r\n-Find the right path to the end point<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you can see, the graphics of this game are not very beautiful, and there is no beautiful music, but hopefully you can enjoy the gameplay.
