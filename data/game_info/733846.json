I\u00a0don't think I\u00a0ever made it to the second floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's why I\u00a0decided to recreate it closer to what my experience of the game was: not moving from the center of the screen,\u00a0and just be rushed by enemies dancing to\u00a0Masato Ishizaki's tune.</p>\n<p><strong>Kung Funky</strong>\u00a0therefore ended up becoming a mash-up of<em>\u00a0Kung-Fu Master</em>\u00a0and a rhythm game \u00e0 la<em>\u00a0Dance Dance Revolution</em>\u00a0or<em>\u00a0Guitar Hero.\u00a0</em>The original<em>\u00a0Kung-Fu Master</em> was inspired by what turned out to be\u00a0<strong>Bruce Lee</strong>'s final\u00a0movie<em> \"The Game of Death\",</em> so in its honor I\u00a0drew my main character as a pixelated version of Lee in the movie, with his signature yellow jumpsuit and<em>\u00a0Onitsuka Tiger</em> sneakers. For the background I mixed some elements from<em>\u00a0Kung-Fu Master</em> with some from the film.</p>\n<p><strong>Kung Funky</strong> was made in a week (OK, it\u00a0ended up being\u00a0more like 10 days)\u00a0during a\u00a0Week Sauce\u00a0game jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3e02730d5d26c1c1d6db1b35875114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mystery Coconut Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
