The game is sidescrolling with keyboard controls. Interactibles will be very hard to miss.</li><li><strong>Combining everything with everything</strong> to brute force a progress. The inventory system will guide the player so that only relevant interactions are available. There's no room for tedious use-this-on-that routines.</li><li><strong>Speaking to everyone about everything.\u00a0</strong>Characters will only say relevant things, and there will be no long lists of topic to deplete.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>If you like the demo, show us some love and write something nice in the comments, or even make a donation.\u00a0</p><p>Credits:<br/>A game by Faravid Interactive<br/><br/>Margo: Ivy Dupler<br/>Susie: Sally Beaumont<br/>Kim: Miranda Gauvin<br/>Daniel: Andy Manjuck<br/><br/>Music by Jacob Lincke</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/662b6f662cab665d81c63026a281fa27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Faravid"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
