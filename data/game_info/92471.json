She is alone after her mom vanishes, but finds strength in a powerful spirit she can control with her mind. She'll need to master her new telekinetic ability to navigate through a surreal world between life and death.\r\n\t\r\n\t With Little Bug's twin stick control system, you can simultaneously guide both Nyah and her companion spirit. Their connection is a multi-situational tool, allowing creative gameplay and fast-paced puzzles.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Little Bug is best played with the left and right joysticks of an xbox controller</strong> on a machine running windows, but if you are using a keyboard, use A+D and arrows in place of sticks.
