We still had the music we composed for the game. This is just a simple story behind what we were wanting to create. The game originally would of been an RPG. Either way, we hope you enjoy the story. \r\n***WARNING***\r\nThe story does contain violence and gore but only in text.\u00a0\r\nAnd TYPOS!!! We didn't feel right changing art assets as they are not so much a \"bug\". Please forgive us.\u00a0\r\nBUG\u00a0FIXES\u00a0POST\u00a0SUBMISSION:\r\nThe Z index on some of the story blocks were scrolling BEHIND the background :-( so I went in and re-ordered them. That's the only change.\r\nMUSIC:\r\nWe hope you enjoy our original music that we recorded. It is designed to be background for the game, but ended up being the center piece for it :-)\r\n\r\nWE WILL BE UPDATING TO THE RPF POST JAM SO CHECK BACK!!\r\n\r\nSPOTIFY:\r\nOur Spotify Page\u00a0-\u00a0check\u00a0out\u00a0our\u00a0original music\u00a0on spotify\r\nOur YouTube Channel\u00a0-\u00a0our\u00a0YouTube\u00a0channel (more\u00a0coming\u00a0soon)\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 27th 2021 @ Oreilly's Dallas\r\nIf you happen to be in the DFW area, come out to Oreilly's Sports Bar on Nov. 27 @ 8:30 to hear us play live.
