{"id": 59707, "slug": "aground", "name": "Aground", "name_original": "Aground", "description": "Splash!<br/><br/>You\u2019re plunged deep into the black, frigid waters. Your lungs scream for air. With your last bit of strength, you pull yourself ashore.<br/><br/>You have nothing but the clothes on your back and fallen branches all around. That ship was your last hope, and now it lies in pieces off the shore of this deserted island. Are you the only one who survived the crash?<br/><br/><br/><br/>You're not alone. You don't know how the others survived. You don't know if you can trust them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You have to rebuild. You have to learn ancient skills long since forgotten by humanity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This island may be deserted, but with work, innovation and a little help, perhaps you can make it a home.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But to have a future, you\u2019ll have to challenge the forces that caused the crash in the first place\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>All you can do is hope that when THEY return, this time you\u2019ll be ready.<br/><br/>Try the Demo!<br/>Aground started out as a web game you could play for free in your browser, and after getting excellent ratings and over 2.5 million plays across many portals, we ran a successful Kickstarter which let us make the early access version available here! However, the web version is still available as an expansive free demo, with around 8 hours of play that will give you a great sense of the game. Give it a try! Your saves will transfer seamlessly to the early access version should you decide to get it!<br/><br/>What Is Aground?<br/>Aground was designed around the theme of Progression, and inspired by Utopian Mining, Starbound and A Dark Room. You start out with only the rudimentary ability to gather wood, and you can eventually build your way up to a thriving settlement, expand to other islands, develop advanced technology, and learn magic. Will you be able to confront the threat that caused you to crash? Fly dragons? Launch into space? The sky is literally not the limit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With Aground, our goal is to keep you continually surprised, with exciting new options opening up around every corner, so you\u2019re always wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d. By the end of the game, even though there are a lot of systems and complexity, since everything has been built up bit-by-bit, it is all easily manageable.Where To?<br/>We have a LOT planned between now and the full launch - from completing the story, to space travel, co-op multiplayer and more! Be a part of the journey and offer suggestions as we post monthly updates to improve the game!
