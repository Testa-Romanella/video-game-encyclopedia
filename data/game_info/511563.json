Be careful not to waste your energy on people who are wearing face cover and keeping distance from other humans. Lucky for you, it seems there is an abundant supply of people who think they are above these safety measures and above caring for other's well-being!</p>\n<p>Play as a human!</p>\n<p>The health experts say you should stay away from large gatherings and wear a mask. IDIOTS! You want to go about your day! Try and complete all of your tasks before heading back home. Be careful, the virus stalks the streets looking for those who don't wear a mask. Unfortunately for you your ego keeps getting the best of you and you keep taking your mask off. Balance navigating the town and fighting to keep your mask on to complete your tasks and evade the virus!</p>\n<p>This game is meant to parody the dangers of not wearing face cover and not social distancing (possibly related to a certain real life pandemic). While this is a silly game and shouldn't be taken too seriously, the real world consequences for not protecting yourself and others from a pandemic are serious.</p>\n<p>This is a \"pay what you want\" game, so please feel free to download it for FREE!
