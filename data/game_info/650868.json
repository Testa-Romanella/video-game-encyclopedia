Strategist, can we count on you? This slime steals our food and uses it to breed. You get various units. Tell them what to do and save our islands! Later on there will be also enemy soldiers arriving on ships. They will attack your units and the fences. You will need to plan your strategy carefully. Learn to control your soldiers and use the terrain to your advantage. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will be busy, but isn't it worth it to be victorious, and become immortal through the stories told by our people? Oh Lord! It is worth it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy freedom of movement in full 3D with no fixed paths in this tower defense with RTS elements. Your units are your towers and you can build fences anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSet your units' behavior like: how far they can move or who to attack first and create a perfect team to defend against slimy ooze coming out of the volcanoes as well as the enemy units arriving on ships. Last 13th level is endless, so you can keep on improving and competing on a leader board forever! Another leader board is for the combined score of the 12 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are only two resources: wood for fences and food. There are no upgrades for units and the game is very easy to start, but over time with many various units there are many ways to win.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter completing the game keep on improving your scores inventing new strategies and challenging other players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13d99a6615fa08c3f6468ff098d2788.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Babooshka Bytes"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["xavenue"], "esrb_rating": null}
