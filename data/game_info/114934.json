It's worth remembering how near we came to extinction at one stage.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\"According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000\u201310,000 surviving individuals. It is supported by genetic evidence suggesting that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.\"\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwilight of Humanity was created in 48 hours for \r\n\tLudum Dare 31 (<em>\"Entire Game On One Screen\"</em>) Compo.

It is not a friendly game. You are supposed to be confused, you are supposed to struggle to figure out the game's system, \r\n\t<em>and you are supposed to ultimately fail to survive</em>. In this it is akin to a minimalistic Dwarf Fortress.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de3b2c76137b37b27c3941562940651b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["wilbefast"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
