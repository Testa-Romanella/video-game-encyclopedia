I am contacting you from Cybertron with a critical mission. The Autobots and the people of Earth need your help. Our most powerful artifact, the Allspark, the source of all Transformers life, has shattered into pieces. We have tracked their signal to Earth. The Decepticons are coming for them. We must get to them before the Decepticons, or else they will wield unimaginable power. Find the shards, secure them, and protect the people of Earth from the Decepticon attack. I\u2019m counting on you Bumblebee. Gear up, and roll out! <br/><br/>BRING MIND-BLOWING AUGMENTED REALITY TO YOUR WORLD <br/>The Bee Vision app is an action-packed experience that uses augmented reality markers to bring the battle to life in your room! It\u2019s almost like being inside a video game! With Bee Vision wearable gear, you can battle Decepticons by targeting and destroying enemies that appear around you in your real-world environment. You'll blast through 10-levels of play on a mission to locate and secure Allspark shards before the Decepticons get them. Face off in a final showdown against the merciless Megatron to defeat the threat once and for all. Along the way, you'll hear guidance from Optimus Prime, voiced by Transformers legend Peter Cullen. <br/><br/>PLAY AS BUMBLEBEE ANYTIME<br/>Gear up like Bumblebee with or without the Bee Vision augmented reality goggles.
