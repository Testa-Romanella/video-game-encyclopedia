In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players in the role of a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.</p>\n<p>Descent: FreeSpace was well received as a single-player space simulation that integrated all the desired features of its genre, from competent AI wingmen, to the presence of large capital ships that not only dwarf the fighters piloted by the player, but also explode spectacularly when destroyed. However, the game's multiplayer mode was criticised, as it was plagued by lag and inaccurate tracking of statistics. An expansion for the game, which was less well received, was also released in 1998 under the title of Silent Threat, and focuses on events after the main game's campaign with the player working for an intelligence branch of the Terrans' armed forces that later attempt to overthrow the Terran government. A sequel to Descent: FreeSpace entitled FreeSpace 2, was released in 1999 to critical acclaim.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-06T23:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f1e4b9f960f527f5c7c304758308bb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 60, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Volition", "Hyperion Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions", "Amiga", "Haage & Partner"], "esrb_rating": null}
