The experiment: how fast can he run, dive, jump, and outwit the killer maze he is trapped in. He needs your help to guide him through this fun and addictive runner! <br/><br/>INSTRUCTIONS<br/><br/>Electro Cross is a runner style game loosely based off newer runners like Temple Run and older runners like Metro Cross (\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30af\u30ed\u30b9). The goal is to make it to the end without the timer ending. Move your finger around the screen to move Electro and tap to make him jump. Run into the cans to get certain bonuses (like time or points). Jump over the slowdown squares and holes. Step on the switches to make the laser walls disappear. <br/><br/>If there is any concerns or comments, please send them to kimun8tytech@gmail.com<br/><br/>Thanks for the support!<br/>16 Bit Games", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b083bcd404d42d870d06644afab7e0.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDVyPVtLPAY", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nick Pothier"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Nick Pothier"], "esrb_rating": null}
