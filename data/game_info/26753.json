Swipe the touch screen to launch them in a mass \n      attack against enemies, then tap the enemies into submission.\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Players use the stylus on the touch screen to control a swarm of up to \n        10 Kirby characters at once. They can help players defeat enemies and \n        find treasure. The number of Kirby characters under a player\u2019s control \n        is important, as some challenges require a specific number of Kirby \n        characters in order to be solved.
