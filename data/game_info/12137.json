The \"Dome\" project consisted of several programs.<br/>\r\nThe most famous projects of the company were InterShelter and InterSpace.<br/>\r\nInterShelter meant to build underground bunkers that could shelter residents from catastrophic events for half a century. Keyvan Morris, one of the most successful construction magnate on the West Coast, was appointed as project manager. The program started in 2024, and has gained wide popularity on the background of the growing threat of military conflict in the Middle East. Company is frequently mentioned in certain medications, developed in conjunction with a program of shelters.<br/>\r\nInterSpace included four projects: removing near-Earth space debris, building a Mars outpost,  system to protect against dangerous celestial bodies, as well as the creation of an autonomous colony in Earth orbit (Dark Sky). <br/>\r\nBright future, space exploration, colonization of new planetary systems - everything Dark Sky promised - faded in the glow of raging star.<br/>\r\nLittle is reported about the orbital colony after the disaster. No much interest on that  from people trying to survive on a dying planet, however,<br/>\r\nScraps of documents and drawings, inventions, prototypes can still be found in shelters, laboratories, bunkers. But no one remembers whether Dark Sky is real or is it just a legend.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRules of the game:<br/>\r\nThere are 50 players spawned at location. When you're in lobby you can start playing in group of 4 people maximum.<br/>\r\nThere are 7 shelters on location. Every shelter has from 1 to 3 rescuing capsules (randomly).<br/>\r\nYou have 30 minutes to open shelters (find and set up 2 batteries), get into the capsule and become rescued from the storm.<br/>\r\nEveryone starts the game with the same stats. Everyone needs to get/collect the weapons, armors, batteries which are spawned randomly during the process of game. <br/>\r\nThere is just one aim - to survive in capsule but everyone can have their own strategy to achieve this. <br/>\r\nThere is no inventory in the game. The character needs to carry everything. It is allowed to put on two primary weapons (rifles, guns, shotguns) and two secondary weapons (pistols). The other weapon can be put on only if you replace the one that you already have on yourself. Bullets and medical kits do not have weight and can be added to inventory in any quantity.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:26:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e219b0d40d7316cd1d429b19219ef9a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.03, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 372, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 12, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 33, "suggestions_count": 476, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 33, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skies Technologies"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skies Technologies"], "esrb_rating": null}
