Use your new tech to survive, expand, and defeat all six guardians and put an end to the onslaught of enemy shapes!<br/><br/><br/>There's more to your base then just the defensive side though. You'll need to carefully plan out not only the design of your front line, but the logistics side of your base as well. Careful power management and building placement is essential if you want to avoid your base running out of power and getting overrun!<h3>Join the community!</h3>Want to help take part in Vectorio's development, and change the future of the game for everyone?
