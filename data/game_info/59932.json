{"id": 59932, "slug": "bug-attack", "name": "Bug Attack!", "name_original": "Bug Attack!", "description": "Bug Attack! is a game inspired by arcade classics including Missile Command and Space Invaders.<br/><br/>Players are tasked with protecting their building as long as they can. Bugs emerge from the ground, many of which from random locations, at an increasing rate. Which is the greater enemy? The bug horde, or your own nerves?<br/><br/>To help, once you've earned certain amounts of points, you earn powerful bug bombs, and health-restoring building repair kits- but not even these can fight the bugs off for long!<br/><br/><br/>Want to team up with a friend? Plug in a controller, and a second player can take command of a building-mounted turret(don't ask, it's a game!) to help fight off the never ending waves of creepy crawlies.<br/><br/><br/>Tired of Bugs? Try to protect your wallet from the relentless savings! This mode is for one or two players, and replicates with 100% accuracy the pain your wallet feels when those Sales hit and light up your wishlist.<br/><br/><br/>The Steam Version of Bug Attack! includes extras and achievements, which you unlock by scoring points over time. These unlock a variety of fun bonus options and extra gameplay modes!<br/><br/> Bug Attack! will continue to be supported post-launch with new modes, functionality, and extra content, free of charge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d957c3df923de51f822ee2a31ac1a138.jpg", "website": "http://www.ludicrousones.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 109}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Ludicrous Ones"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["The Ludicrous Ones"], "esrb_rating": null}
