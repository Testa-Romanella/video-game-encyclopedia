I'm sure there are bugs in here somewhere, but the game is more-or-less stable.<br/></em></p>\r\nWhat is this?\r\n<p><em>\"Prism: The Maze Game\"</em> is a version of capture the flag played in a user-defined room. Rooms can be defined through lua using a simple API. All docs can be found in the <em>'README.md'</em> file. The download includes examples and tests.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Use WASD to move. Grab flags from other teams and bring them to your base. You can steal flags from other players. Shift to sprint.</p>\r\nHow To Run\r\n<p>\r\nTo get straight to playing the game, extract the archive and run the 'prism' executable. The default server is platypro.net, port 22133. I try to keep a server up.\r\nThe server is set up with a timed game. At least two people are needed to play!\r\nTo run your own server, run 'prisms' inside of a terminal window. More info on this can be found in the included readme.\r\n</p>\r\nSupport\r\n<p>For bugs: https://gitlab.com/platypro/prism/issues<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nIf you need to report a bug, please include the following:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What happened?</li>\n<li>What do you think should have happened?</li>\n<li>Is it reproducible, if so how?</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/5566b42c29600bf2dd20cc0cf3e1bcb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Platyproductions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
