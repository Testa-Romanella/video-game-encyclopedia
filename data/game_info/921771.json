Global Game Jam 2023 Game", "description": "<p>Play as a fun little root vegetable, Carrot Guy, and avoid the hungry ravenous rabbits that want to eat you! Click on the carrot to being and use \"A\" and \"D\" or \"Left Arrow Key\" and \"Right Arrow Key\" to move.\u00a0 \"Esc\" to close the game.</p>\n<p>The goal was to make a game built around the theme of \"Roots\". I saw this theme and had a bit of a difficult time coming up with a couple ideas (albeit, probably because I had my hopes up of other ideas, I had for myself, lol). Eventually I came around to the fun idea of making the game themed around ROOT vegetables such as carrots, radishes, turnips and such.\u00a0 After looking at the diversifiers, I found the year of the rabbit and felt it was a perfect match for my carrot character. Sadly, I could not get the game to where I wanted it as I had lots of work and life happen in the week, but in the day I was able to work I sure got a good start for a game I can work on and improve!</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you like what I made so far and I hope you check it out again in the future when the game gets some improvements!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:18:43", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JKH1998"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
