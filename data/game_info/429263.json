{"id": 429263, "slug": "circuit-rush", "name": "Circuit Rush", "name_original": "Circuit Rush", "description": "<p>This game was made in 5 days for Weekly Game Jam#144. The theme for the game jam was \"In the Dark,\" and the idea for this puzzle game came to mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of moving the player around the game board to find the end of the level and light up the game board.\u00a0 The catch it this... you are only allowed to see the walls around you, and the tiles that you have already moved on.\u00a0The goal is to\u00a0 complete the circuit as fast as possible. Because of this, the game doubles as both a puzzle game and as a speedrunner. The speedrunning part of this game will be improved once I start to add some more features and game modes.\u00a0There are certain tiles that cannot be moved on, and there are even ones that will teleport you around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because I'm bad at game art, I decided to go with a very basic\u00a0 art style for this game.\u00a0 The art and sound elements are supposed to make it feel like an older arcade game.</p>\n<p>If you\u00a0 this sounds interesting to you, please give it a shot, and leave a review so I can help improve it in the future.</p>\n<p>(Pixellari) Font made by:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/zacchary-dempsey-plante.d6765</p>\n<p>Thanks for the amazing sound effects:</p>\n<p>alanmcki:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/alanmcki/</p>\n<p>ShockwaveFilms:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/ShockwaveFIlms/</p>\n<p>akelley6:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/akelley6/</p>\n<p>n_audioman:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/n_audioman/</p>\n<p>OwlStorm:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/OwlStorm/</p>\n<p>SamsterBirdies:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/SamsterBirdies/</p>\n<p>MentosLat:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/MentosLat/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/844/8448f283f3b8beb171036d4f2c3d634d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lucky89"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
