{"id": 366097, "slug": "slaveblade", "name": "Slaveblade", "name_original": "Slaveblade", "description": "DISCLAIMER:  Made by one dev.<br/>\r\nSlaveblade is the story of Idraxymus the Enslaver.  Already dead and tormented, Idraxymus makes a deal for resurrection.  Everything in his path must be slain and his final destination is a mystery.  Slaveblade is an exploration about what it means to live and die.  It is a tale about where we are going, and who we are willing to hurt to get there.  The game is a fast hacknslasher.  Paced more like shooter than rpg, it requires high apm and lots of weapon switching.  Prepare to die.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGAMPLAY TIPS:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Roll, man, roll.  Then roll.  (spacebar)<br/>\r\n- Hit fast, then roll.<br/>\r\n- You have 5 weapons (keys 1-5).  There is no animation to switch weapons.  It happens instantly.  You will need to learn to switch mid swing so that you can chain up combos using different swords.<br/>\r\n- First weapon:  hits the hardest<br/>\r\n- Second weapon:  all of your animation speeds are faster.  So switch to this and run.  Switch to start a swing, then switch to another weapon for it's effect.<br/>\r\n- Third weapon:  this weapon snares/roots the enemy when it lands.  Very important for controlling enemies.<br/>\r\n- Fourth weapon:  this weapon heals you.  There aren't many powerups/heals in this game, so use this to keep your health up.<br/>\r\n- Fifth weapon:  this weapon gives you mana.  Once you have enough mana, you can cast spells with E.  Each weapon casts a different spell.<br/>\r\n- There's no autolock.  So don't focus on a single enemy.  Dance around them, roll, snare them, and wear them down.  Lots of other games already do autolock.  I'm experimenting with a new type of combat, but it does take a bit of practice to get used to it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/688416dc01adee3326ccad51a2782177.jpg", "website": "https://www.slaveblade.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NegativeGenius"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NegativeGenius"], "esrb_rating": null}
