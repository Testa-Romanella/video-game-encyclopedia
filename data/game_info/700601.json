I decided to upload it here so my friends and classmates can access it more easily if they want to check it out. It takes 10 mins at most to play and has one joke choice, and one ending. But let me know if you like it, I might continue development for the full story.</p>\n<p>Currently only available in English.\u00a0The original story was written by Robert Louis Stevenson.\u00a0The art and music was made by me. The background noises and sound effects belong to the BBC Sound Library and Fesliyan Studios.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fee/fee42a3bc9a492387a7765efccbdad3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Finn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
