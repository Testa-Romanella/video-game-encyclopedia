Left and right keys for turning.<br/></p>\n<p>Get points by forcing your opponent out of the arena, or by getting into the scoring zone of the opposing color. Grab a chainsaw and try to force your opponent into your blockers if you can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:54:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5b87babcb4ef7597c3d4cd0e14be226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D.Galga"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
