This will allow you to appear on the leaderboard of the game. Once you do this (<strong>and check the controls</strong>) you can start the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, you will start on the looting area, where you will have to find pieces for your car. The pieces are sorted by 3 categories:</p>\n<p>Lower tier: GRAY\u00a0</p>\n<p>Middle tier: BLUE</p>\n<p>Higher tier: GOLD</p>\n<p>The better your pieces, the best your car will be, as it will be not only faster but also have a better grip or acceleration. But don't lose much time looting, as this time will be part of your final score.</p>\n<p>Once you have all your car pieces collected, you will have to find the portal and start racing. You have 5 laps to get the best time possible. Don't try to cheat and exceed track limits, or your time will be deleted!</p>\r\nThe total time will make your position in the ranking. Are you on the top-10?
