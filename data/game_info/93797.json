But years later, his work was discovered, gradually becoming incredibly popular. With millions of fans wondering how his final, unfinished novel would have ended, a clever publisher commissions an artificial intelligence \"simulacrum\" of Holmquist, called KRIS, to find out.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHolmquist's unfinished book, a novel called <em>Ice-Bound</em>, centers around a remote polar research base, eternally sinking into ice. With successive owners over years and decades building fresh new layers on top, the station became a vertical labyrinth of forgotten histories. Each level (and each chapter) moves farther back in time, deeper into the ice.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWho were the people who lived here? What stories lie buried beneath them? And what's at the bottom, the deepest level down: the enigmatic foundations of Carina Station?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find out more about the companion book here!</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"[I]nteractive fiction's gone some daring places in the last few years...
