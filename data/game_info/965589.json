It weaves a mysterious &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot; story through-out its gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>STORY SET-UP:</p>\n<p>This world was once a predictable place, where heroes stomped minions and rescued damsels. But now it is mutating into something much stranger. As a result the heroes are missing or unwilling, and the villains have huddled away searching for more from life.</p>\n<p>The protagonist, a disgraced prisoner, finds himself in over his head amidst these changes. He&#39;s tasked with infiltrating the Eastern Lands and rescuing his kingdom&#39;s princess in exchange for freedom. But he&#39;s no warrior, and the world&#39;s mutation is spreading...</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<pre><code>Arrow keys to move, climb, or push.  \nX to jump (or to let go of a ladder).  \nC for actions/interactions.  \nR to reset a level if you get stuck.  \nW to switch toggle fullscreen (letterboxed).  \nM to toggle muting of all audio, L to toggle half-volume mode.  \nP to pause or unpause (this also opens a list of controls).  \nF4 to exit the program.\n\n\nProgress is auto-saved at title-cards between levels.  \nTouching any enemy or hazard will kill you and reset the level.  \nWatch out, its easy to get stuck in pits or puzzles.
