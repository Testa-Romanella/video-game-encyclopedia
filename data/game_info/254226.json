An AI has generated thousands of fake words, and you will either be given an AI-generated word or a real English word. Your job is to figure out which. There are three different gamemodes, one is a \"free play\" mode in which you play infinitely and are given a percentage score as you go along. One is \"Time\" mode, in which you have 30 seconds to get as many correct as you can, and a \"20 questions\" mode, in which you must answer 20 questions and are given a percentage score from that. Change your gamemode by pressing space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bb/4bbb50013057859a4c681bf2918c85ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
