Use your weapon in order to dehydrate them. But be careful because they come by waves so be strategic or you\u2019ll lose your coffee.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>After being caught by surprise from the rival gang composed by tea, chocolate and smoothie you\u2019ll have to survive against them while killing as many as possible\u00a0to reach the best score. In order to do it you\u2019ll have to move around using the cup controller (or a keyboard)\u00a0 and to shoot them.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The cup controller is an alternative controller who was created for this game. You can move Fico, the main character, using only the alternative controller. If you want to do the controller at your home here's the way to do it, you'll have to put this code in the Arduino :\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJEHAcXwsCS71IcjAXcyPDMs_6mXyj0o/view?usp=shari...<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGame Art :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>Jeanne CABON</p>\r\nGame Design :\r\n<p>Thomas MONNERIE<br/></p>\r\nGame\u00a0Programming:\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n<p>Thomas TAKAGI\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>R\u00e9mi VEDRENNE</p><p>Lucas Lindemans</p>\r\nHMI (Human-machine Interfaces):\r\n<p>Arthur VAN EECKHOUT</p>\n<p>Aurore FINANCE</p>\r\nArtworks :\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>Baptiste ROBINE\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Luna GAY\r\n</p>\r\nCommunication :\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>Nicolas GADONNA-DAUCE\r\n</p>\n<p>Nahla MEKIOUI\r\n</p>\r\nIn game :\r\n\r\n<p>Adam BELINY-MARTIN\r\n</p>\n<p>Arthur LE VEZIEL\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGame identity :\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>Nicolas LE GALL\r\n</p>\r\nUI :\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>Charline LANDRY\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Game made during a Game Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:41:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f287222c4375ab94ded0605e03aedce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThomasMONNERIE"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
