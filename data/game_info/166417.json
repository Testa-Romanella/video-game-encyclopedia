We want to put an emphasis on having fun and rewarding skillful play, rather than long tutorials and collecting every trinket in the level.</p><p><strong>BRUTAL STEALTH KILLS<br/></strong>Neon can hide in plain sight by blending into the bright colors around him. In this 'stealth mode' he can assassinate enemies that are close by.</p><p><strong>INTENSE BOSS BATTLES<br/></strong>We want every boss battle in this game to feel like it could be THE FINAL boss battle and be chock full of\u00a0\u201cOH SHIT\u201d\u00a0moments. Each boss has multiple unique phases (no recycled gimmicks or ideas).</p><p><strong>NON-LINEAR PROGRESSION<br/></strong>A boss select screen that lets players choose the order they\u2019ll take down the bosses. Defeating bosses will unlock different items leading players to develop their own strategy (or googling one).</p><p><strong>HAND-DRAWN CARTOON STYLE<br/></strong>I'm\u00a0shooting for \"Saturday morning cartoon meets SNES concept art.\" That is, every character is designed to be visually memorable, and oozing with personality.<br/></p><p><strong>RADICAL SOUNDTRACK</strong><br/>It\u2019s only fitting that Neon slays enemies to a soundtrack that equally slays the player. Expect lots of driving guitar-and-synth-based music influenced by the game\u2019s exotic locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Steam (Consoles TBD)</p>\n<p><strong>Development Timeline: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>March 1st 2018 - STEAM EARLY ACCESS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>2019 - FULL RELEASE (PC, MAC, Linux)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a435d3e98bb38e0ab1299b1a741c5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
