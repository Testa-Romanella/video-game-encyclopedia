We tried to create a single-player puzzle game (please keep in mind we suck at designing puzzles) which would be relaxing yet at times challenging.<br/></p>\n<p>The game has currently four levels, you can finish each one of them (we tried our best to test it).</p>\n<p>This time we tried to make every asset by ourselves, so the credit (except for the music) is all ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: The game is highly unfinished. We didn't manage to make it (and test it) on time. Please keep that in mind.
