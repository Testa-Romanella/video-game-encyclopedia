{"id": 685234, "slug": "cookie-spartan-game-labs", "name": "COOKIE (Spartan Game Labs)", "name_original": "COOKIE (Spartan Game Labs)", "description": "<p>Brief Description:</p>\n<ul><li>A very enjoyable and non-frustrating game. The goal is simply to complete all four levels without running out of time or dying to obstacles. The theme is a very calming platformer game which gradually increases in difficulty, allowing the player to experience the full spectrum of emotions. The fast pace along with a stress inducing timer leads to the player\u2019s keyboard to have an increased 70% rate of fracturation as well as shattered keys. We are in partnership with the company that makes these keyboards because more broken keyboards mean more keyboards needed which means increased supply and more demand. We will profit greatly from this and invest our money into a life sized statue of betterboxcenter, which will surely help future generations to come. Thank you for your support and please donate good grades to our great and noble cause.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Instructions on how to play:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Use right and left arrow keys or \u201ca'' and \u201cd\u201d to move and space to jump. Green blocks bounce you, and try to avoid the red spikes, red enemies, and colorful wasps. Follow the arrows and wait for the platforms to move you to were you are supposed to go. For a surprise, touch the cookie man. Beat all four levels to win!\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T05:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/1213ab94aac0aa85fec636fe2ffb8069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
