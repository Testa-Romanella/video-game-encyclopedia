We may not be the hero, but with our help, you can.\"</p>\n<p>You are an employee of Be The Hero ltd. Heroes who are preparing to go on a quest submit an application to us, and we help choose the right gear for them from our storefront. Read their applications, as well as a report we've written up on them, then choose items from the shop. Click on an item to read a description, and a customer review of it! Think about what sort of items they may need, not necessarily what exactly what they say they might need.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>[design, programming, art and writing by Dexter McChesney and Calico; made for Bored Pixels Jam 8 in 2021.
