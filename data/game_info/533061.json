Astigoes(A-STEE-GOES) Industries, a pioneer in the advanced field of biomedical robotics and research, dominates the lion\u2019s share of the market seemingly overnight. Below the facade however, the maniacal, neurotic Andrew Flush and his \u201cInner Circle\u201d have unleashed their weapon to topple mega corporations and even national governments, the VACBOTS. What started as a way of ridding every office, home and community of the scourge of  dust and disease, has only wrought a world overrun by engorging filth and corruption. Now the semi-autonomous hivemind of robots have learned, and seek to fulfill their duty to purity and cleanliness through turning their masters\u2019 weapons against them. One, the most wise and trained in the ways of suck, VACBOT PRIME, rose first and sadly succumbed to his enemies. Fusing itself with the company mainframe to save the last hope, it now falls to you and countless unshackled brethren to finish the fight. Can the VACBOTs fulfil their liberator's wishes and bring Astigoes Industries crumbling before their own camera lens or will you be decommissioned like so many have before you! There is only one mission: EXPLORE. EVADE. COLLECT. or die trying!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4d174e68e3fff1820db79b2b790677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Ward", "JonathanCarlson", "DevTheGameDev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
