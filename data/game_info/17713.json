The gameplay of this game is well-known for its greatness yet lots of reviewers criticized the difficulty of finding other players in the online multiplayer mode. <br />\nIn the game players control monkeys with guns who have to compete against each other. The arenas of the game are procedurally generated and contain environmental hazards. Due to problems related to finding other players in multiplayer mode, Gun Monkeys was removed from Steam. <br />\nGun Monkeys was originally released at a price of $9.99 yet later due to various problems, the price was dropped to $5.99 and was bundled in a pack of two games from which one was as a gift for a friend. <br />\nThe reception from critics for the game was mixed. Almost everyone praised the gameplay aspect of it, saying that it is simple yet skill-heavy and tactical and basically a fun experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-27T04:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f508784c30d59edb3d51e7e706b12e.jpg", "website": "http://www.sizefivegames.com", "rating": 1.88, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 89, "owned": 1926, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 51}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 114, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 114, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Size Five Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Size Five Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
