Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles. The goal of this abstract board game is simple: push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board! But beware, it\u2019s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! <br/><br/>HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK...<br/><br/>Create a plan of attack to push your opponent\u2019s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you\u2019re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent\u2019s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There\u2019s no use in rushing; it\u2019s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers. <br/><br/>...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE. <br/><br/>If you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it\u2019s better to be patient if you want to win! <br/><br/>DON\u2019T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE <br/><br/>The keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent\u2019s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher. <br/><br/>PLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS <br/><br/>Play alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends.
