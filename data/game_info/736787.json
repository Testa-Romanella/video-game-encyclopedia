In my take of it, the guns instead are cork guns, shooting corks instead of bullets.<br/><br/>These corks can be re-used, if you hit a cactus, it'll drop on the floor and be able to be picked up, by either player. This also means the other player can pick up your dropped cork.<br/><br/>A new round begins when either player is hit, or when the time runs out, and the winner is decided on the first to 10 points.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f9648496b2b2c627fcaae2adfb1cb7fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hydra_derg"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
