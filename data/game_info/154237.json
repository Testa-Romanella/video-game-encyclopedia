Your husband is sleeping and his sunshade isn't working very well so it closes itself randomly, whenever you\u00a0 open\u00a0 his sunshade, he gives you \"thank you\" kiss and somehow you get impregnated, after a while a new kid is born.</p>\n<p>As for your kids they run all around the map, get near them for them to follow you, bring them to the home sunshade (the blue one), they'll stay there until they've fully recovered.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to not let anyone die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a9/5a9fd3c2b2cc083a5a5ff688a2df01a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Masteryder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
