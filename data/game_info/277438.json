Your husband is missing. That's why you're taking the train to Vermont, to look for him in his family's old mansion. You'll explore creepy environments, consult eldritch tomes, and solve bizarre puzzles as you search for Peter, but your surroundings, your past, and even your identity seem to change subtly\u2014or dramatically\u2014as you make your way through the town of Backwater and approach Cragne Manor.</p>\n<p>Each location is a different author's take on a tribute to Anchorhead, or an original work of Lovecraftian cosmic horror, or a deconstruction of cosmic horror, or a gonzo parody of cosmic horror, or a parody of some other thing, or a portrait of life in Vermont, or a pure experiment in writing with Inform 7, or something else entirely. There are tons of puzzles. The puzzles get\u00a0<em>very weird.</em></p>\n<p>Cragne Manor was organized by\u00a0Jenni Polodna\u00a0and\u00a0Ryan Veeder.
