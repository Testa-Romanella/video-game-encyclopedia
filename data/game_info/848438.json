Obviously, just taking the mechanics of both games directly would make it very unfair, so a few changes have been made. Such changes include:</p>\n<ul><li>A \"void\" zone that only checkers pieces can go to to prevent chess pieces from hugging walls</li><li>The objective of the checkers pieces is not to capture the chess king, but all of the chess pieces</li><li>The checkers pieces can move in all four cardinal directions as well, provided they are promoted</li><li>The back four pieces of the checkers pieces start off promoted to prevent 1 queen from terrorising every checkers piece from behind</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: I haven't make a menu screen, so you need to refresh the tab to replay.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is pre-release version.
