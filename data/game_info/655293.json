In order to make things correctly one should try to move around while shooting the correct colors in order to shut them down faster.</p>\n<p>(And kill as <strong>many as possible to get more coins and buy new guns</strong>, put to 8 in total)</p>\n\n<p>There are many other gamemode-like I\u00a0<em>wanted </em>to include but had no time, <em>I even learned what probuilder was the night before finishing the jam ._.</em></p>\n<p>Game features almost NO audio (I <strong>recommend you to lower your volume</strong> since you may find the 2 only sounds there totally anti-climatic and even annoying too, sorry..), custom models made by me, along with the art, and then obviously some third party assets I used to build everything. So sad I couldn't investigate and add something like painting stuff for real or maybe research more into how shaders work. Oh well xD</p>\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3d63d60c01147062e5085cd8bc0531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VNBP - Leo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
