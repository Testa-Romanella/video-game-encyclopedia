Fly without defense at breakneck speeds to build power, then throw yourself skyward, cut the engines, and attack while in free-fall.</p>\n<p>The game is designed with a heavy emphasis on split-second risk vs reward decisions \u2014 your greatest victories will be achieved through reckless self-endangerment.</p>\n<p>Hyper-responsive controls have been at the core of the design since day 1. Movement is entirely mouse-driven with near zero input latency, allowing your fighter to dance through swarms of enemies at incredible speeds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/186/18646a712db4589e4e04abda79cda7be.jpg", "website": "http://aerobat.thew.nu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Yeager"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
