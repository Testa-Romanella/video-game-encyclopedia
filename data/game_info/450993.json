Since you have scurvy\u00a0 your strength is low and takes a bit to build back up. You have to use your strength wisely to get to the end of each level.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It is a medium difficulty game. I recommend playing in full screen. Good luck!\u00a0 This is version 1.3.1 (fixed some mobile controls\u00a0) (Next version\u00a0 fixing some bugs).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6fe4e01b81d32d3dafec7ee62c94fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wiggle wiggle studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
