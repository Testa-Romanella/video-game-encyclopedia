{"id": 4465, "slug": "worms-ultimate-mayhem", "name": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem", "name_original": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem", "description": "<p>A series, that brought players several notable titles, was mostly set in 2D because artillery turn-based games have a set of mechanics that compliment the closed maps and complicated terrain. But Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a modernized remake of the different direction, taken by the Team 17. This game is a direct remake of Worms 4: Mayhem, expanding the movement mechanics to the 3D environments.<br />\nWorms Ultimate Mayhem adds several features to the typical Worms gameplay. Each player controls a team of 4 or fewer worms and can control one worm at a time, moving around, using items and attacking in a set amount of time. Then after each player moved and attacked in turn with all of their characters round starts over, and the game goes until only one player or a team left. There\u2019s an option for players to play a single player campaign and challenges, from the previous Worms 3D games, or a match against bots with an improved AI. But any Worms have multiplayer modes, both local and online, with ranked matches. Each worm team can be customized with names, voices, hats, signature weapon, taunts and tombstones. Added in-game voice chats and real-time lighting, shaders and post process effects are adding to the improved design and comfortability.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2011-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa7cd93b815b298dd0efa829b98a2aa6.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/WormsTeam17", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 1790, "beaten": 91, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 92, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 198, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 198, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
