Not sure if its a game that anyone would be interested in playing so i would love to get some feedback before continuing work, future improvements include better graphics and animations, a much bigger school with a much more complex storyline, and whatever else people want, but for now here is just a proof of concept\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T10:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de34d76e316f14441a546a2e7b5ed750.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AleisFine"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
