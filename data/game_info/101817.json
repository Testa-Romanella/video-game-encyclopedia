I feel it could just give away the plot and what not. </p><p>Because that's what this game is primarily about, its story. Don't get me wrong Art, Sound and Music are vital components to a visual novel. But I am primarily a writer.</p><p>That being said, in true Game Jam fashion I have carefully picked what assets I've used and made sure nothing was too jarring. </p><p>And when it did feel a bit off, I made it work with the story.</p><p>This is also the first time I've put a story out there like this, so please. Tell me what you think, good or bad.</p><p>Hope you enjoy.</p><p>For the TyranoBuilder Summer Game Jam 2015</p><p>Theme was \"United By Fate\"</p><p> Also considering continuing the story should people show interest or support.</p><p>Thanks. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48ad91bcf07e4284226f69cc2e75556d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cibox3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
