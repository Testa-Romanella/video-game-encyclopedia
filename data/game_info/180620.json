It's meant to be played with your favourite friend or family member (otherwise it's hard). You can only hit enemies\u00a0 that are shooting at your friend and vice versa. Controls for the blue turret are A - left, D - right, SPACE - shooting; and the for orange turret UP - up, DOWN - down and 0 - shooting. This game has exactly 100 lines of code (I hope I counted it right). This is only the project file, because I don't own paid version of Gamemaker Studio 2. Anyone who has GMS 2 still can play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f6/1f6319b94534ef954f1e179762742343.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voivy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
