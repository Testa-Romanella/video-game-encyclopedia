Each year that you level up, blue lines appear which represent the magnetic lines of the sun becoming more and more distorted. At year 11, the magnetic lines become so distorted that the poles flip; this happens close to 140,000 clicks. (Tip: Try to get to at least 1,000 clicks per second and just wait a few minutes if you get bored of clicking).\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82cc37c9d0dde8a6b7822e6478e3c9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Graham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
