It was marketed as a science fiction-themed spin-off to the 1987 arcade game Street Fighter. The English localization of 2010 changed the name and backstory of the main character to imply that he was Ken from the original Street Fighter, whereas the protagonist in the Japanese version is a completely unrelated character named Kevin. 2010 is of a different genre from the traditional Street Fighter games, which are competitive fighting games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-18T15:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/806/806efe60f6f1fd47f52808aa6b334eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 8, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Wii U", "NES", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
