The objective is relocated every time it is reached. There is no way to lose and no way to win but it's a nice demo of how a game can be designed without visuals</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T05:51:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2c5b417090070f85d0ca8ecb65c0656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rojafox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
