Theme of the jam is \"cosmic\", limitation is \"the player must cheat\". So, expect to use some Cheats to beat the game.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you are going to manage a group of scientists, and discover all the secrets of the cosmo. But, if you get bored, you can always send you scientists into the space to shoot some asteroids (real scientists would love it, trust me).</p>\n<p>Hire scientists, produce science, build new tools. Complete all the available researches, and learn something about astronomy. Shoot asteroids to collect money, or you will bankrupt and loose the game. And, remember to use Cheats on your spaceships!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T03:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8df0853a39b3995b42f4903a0ef8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vitbull88"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
