It's a small world, so the culprit could be anybody. Was it the farmer or the intellectual (the lone wolves of Klein)? Could the werewolf be the same person who's been stealing casks of ale from the tavernkeeper? That new merchant in town is short with you, which is suspicious, indeed. The local fisherman may be having an affair. Was it his disgruntled wife who clawed him down in cold blood?</p><p>Created in 48 hours for the 2022 Global Game Jam!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sky Larsen -\u00a0\u00a0<em>Game Design,</em>\u00a0<em>Programming</em>\n</p>\n<p>Dash Ferrero -\u00a0<em>Level Design, Environment Art</em>\n</p>\n<p>Rein Tice -<em>\u00a0Environment Art, Character Models</em>\n</p>\n<p>Cale Castro -\u00a0<em>2-D Art, Writing</em>\n</p>\n<p>Trevor Davis -\u00a0<em>Programmer</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T03:57:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acca160afab86a1a6e557f211f6a8f58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kilansky"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
