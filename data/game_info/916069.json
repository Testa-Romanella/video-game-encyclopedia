As the builder of Scrappy you are responsible for designing and evolving a schematic that can traverse the increasingly difficult challenges. Starting with nothing but Scrappy's heart, give him thrusters that can boost him over obstacles, or weapons to fight back! You can even build frames to take more damage or get creative with designs that can break away into two separate bots. <br/></p>\n<p>Oh! And don't forget to map the control scheme in a way that works for you! Schematic pieces need controls in order to work!<br/></p>\n<p>Remember! The only thing that matters is Scrappy's heart! If you lose his heart then Scrappy dies and the level restarts. But so long as you get Scrappy's heart to the finish then the level is completed.<br/></p>\n\r\nBullet Point Details:\r\n<p>-At the start of the game you will be prompted to build a schematic! Each piece of the schematic costs scrap (which can be earned in each level), so choose wisely. After building a schematic you must map the control scheme and then hit \"Build Schematic\" to be able to put your designing skills to the test!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Build will care and thought! Each schematic piece sale is final. You cannot refund pieces for extra scrap. And keep an eye out for blue gems in each level. Collecting blue gems gives you extra scrap to evolve your schematic design. <br/></p>\n<p>-No schematic piece is an island! Schematic pieces must be connected! All pieces must be able to connect back to Scrappy's heart. You start with a blank page with nothing but Scrappy's heart. As you evolve your schematic, you can only place pieces that are connected to other pieces. And you can only delete pieces that won't leave pieces isolated. <br/></p>\n<p>-Schematic pieces can be destroyed by the enemies and the obstacles  in the level! Fear not! You are given infinite tries! Pressing the  \"escape\" key will reset the level and allow you to adjust your schematic  if needed. <br/></p>\n<p>- Schematic pieces that were destroyed or lost in the  level will be regained upon level completion. So long as you get  Scrappy's heart to the goal, the rest of him will follow.</p>\n<p>-Beat the game by evolving a bot that can make it through all 6 levels. <br/></p>\n<p>-Scrappy only needs to get his heart to the goal in order to progress through the level!</p>\n<p>-Keep an eye out for extra scrap!<br/></p>\n<p>-Collect more gems for a higher score!<br/></p>\n<p>-Beat the level faster for a higher score!</p>\n<p>-Parts that are disconnected from Scrappy's heart can still be controlled!</p>\n<p>-Some, but not all obstacles in your path can be destroyed.</p>\n<p>-Feel free to comment and rate \u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\r\nAssets Used:\r\n\r\n-3 Skyboxes 2\r\n<p>by : Bright Shining Star</p>\n<p>brightshiningstar.webs.com/</p>\n<p>tessmann@s140781566.online.de</p>\r\nSimple Gems Ultimate Animated Customizable Pack\r\n<p>by: Auryn Sky</p>\n<p>www.aurynsky.com</p>\n<p>Aurynskygames@gmail.com</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Lead Designer: Me</p>\n<p>Code: Me</p>\n<p>Level Design: Me<br/></p>\n<p>The bad art and visual design: Also Me</p>\n<p>The good art (The space background image): Bright Shining Star</p>\n<p>The cool gems: Auryn Sky</p>\n<p>Music: Me<br/></p>\n<p>SoundFX: Me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T13:37:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cde562580b7e9b986e1414bdaecd2a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KydenWilson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
