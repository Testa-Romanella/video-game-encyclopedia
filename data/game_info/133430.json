{"id": 133430, "slug": "car-dungeon", "name": "Car Dungeon", "name_original": "Car Dungeon", "description": "<p>CAR DUNGEON has gameplay similar to Super Cars, Super Meat Boy, and Radiant Silver Gun. It's a top-down driving game. The car never stops moving and you have to get safely to the end of the level without crashing. I imagine it as a game that you would play on an arcade cabinet with a joystick, Ms. Pac-Man style. The gameplay is very simple. The trailer is pretty explanatory.</p>\n\n<p>All of the games music is done by DST - <strong>Deceased Superior Technician</strong>. He is a spectacular musician, I strongly recommend checking out his works.</p>\n<p>http://www.nosoapradio.us/</p>\n\n<p>I will update the version and file as I update the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/07717725e77d1105949157904a5f22d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clifford Fry"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
