The royalty aren't the only affected, <br/>however, as some people see their family and friends fall into insanity <br/>and begin doubt the rulers above them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08bad4805fd3b33fda1a74f74f4fd8ca.jpg", "website": "http://rttstudio.com/dammerlicht/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Royal Tea Time Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Royal Tea Time Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
