Each run requires you to adapt to an ever-growing variety of environments, weapons, rivals and more, which I hope gives you lots of playtime and replay value.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Shooter Meets Deck Builder</strong><br/><br/>Build your Library of Weapon Cards - chips containing Ranged Attacks, Melee Attacks, or castable Powers. Each card has different strengths, weaknesses, and synergies, so you need to make decisions to build a Library of Cards that works well for you, your play style, and your current situation within each run.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Powerful Rivals</strong><br/><br/>Overcome a powerful cast of rivals! Challenging boss fights are core to the game play. The rivals you face vary each run, so you'll need to learn and counter many unique bosses to uncover the tower's mystery.<br/><br/><strong>Come Say Hi!</strong><br/>https://discord.gg/3egKhNg", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T15:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/338f947c1db7dc3f2866d6a1ac401713.jpg", "website": "https://tadatoto.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tadatoto"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tadatoto"], "esrb_rating": null}
