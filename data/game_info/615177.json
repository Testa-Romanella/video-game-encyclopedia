However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/><br/>You have successfully defeated the great dragon king Bethlusaa but his spirit lives on and is now lurking in a magical tome. From his sheltering spellbook, he plots to regain power and physical form by possessing the body of Lord Yuz's cousin Yasmine. Your mission is to find the spellbook that shelters Bethlusaa's spirit and exorcise him to the realm of the dead for good while saving Princess Yasmine.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Horde II\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 75 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T05:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a2/1a2d6c3e31b80590a331eb0489da1888_aPddr5s.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
