The mechanics and scope are about right, now I'm just filling out the world and story. It'll be a pretty short game. About 20 minutes long, as that's as much time as the player has to solve the protagonist's fatal flaw: Ego. The Disc Jockey is about DJ Vomit, an overnight radio host who's just got off work and he NEEDS to get some drugs in the next 20 minutes or...well...you'll see.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is my first attempt at a new system I've been calling \"Dialogue Expenditure\" or \"Dialogue Bullets\". It's all about managing your meters and frustration. Waving off certain people who need help so you can keep your head for other conversations you need to have. So far, I've never seen anything like it. So I'm claiming it as mine! Haha.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Engine is Unity, assets are Synty Studios and gamified with Adventure Creator. Music credit goes to White Bat Audio.\u00a0</p><p>ALSO. I'm open to all feedback! Let me know what you think/what could be cool for the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/341ea47c17608fe4fb8f31f552ff7419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DylanDavis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
