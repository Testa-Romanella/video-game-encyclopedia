{"id": 53684, "slug": "arkanoid-1986", "name": "Arkanoid (1986)", "name_original": "Arkanoid (1986)", "description": "<p>Arkanoid (\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9, Arukanoido) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari&#39;s Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and visual layering and depth. The title refers to a doomed mother ship from which the player&#39;s ship, the Vaus, escapes. It was widely ported to contemporary systems and followed by a series of remakes and sequels, including the 1987 arcade game Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh. Arkanoid revived the Breakout concept, resulting in many clones and similar games for home computers, even over a decade later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T16:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6da/6da8ab4f77ecf00143be5a7e394b4437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 37, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 41}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "PC", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "Atari ST", "Apple II"], "developers": ["Atlus", "Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito", "Romstar"], "esrb_rating": null}
