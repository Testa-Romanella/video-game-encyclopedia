IT'S UNDER CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT!\r\n\n<p>Every Choice determines your fate! It is important to choose wisely, as simply pressing the wrong number can lead to your horrific demise, or you obtaining great loot! The game was designed so most any Windows PC could run it with ease. It also provides great replay-ability because every choice has a different outcome. Twists and turns around every number! Just remember to write down your password!\u00a0 Includes secret achievements, multiple endings, and Easter Eggs! Try to find them!</p>\n<p>I plan to port the game to iOS, Android, and OSX soon! Probably around the 1st beta release!</p>\n<p>Check out our Alpha 1.10 version for free! Please consider donations, as this is a one developer project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca8eb9c5a94bd48e7bfae8517a46f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SourceGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
