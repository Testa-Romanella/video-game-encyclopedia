I DID IT!!!\"<br/>\"The Dark Souls of puzzle games.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>----- WHO AM I?<br/><br/>Games were always my escape from the sad reality. But playing games wasn\u2019t enough for me and I wanted something more. I wanted to make games.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I started my career as a software developer in 2007 and after 2 years of saving I bought my MacBook Pro and iPhone 3GS with a plan to make games in my free time. In 2010 I moved from Poland to Canada to start a new life with my wife, but my dream about making games hasn\u2019t changed. Now, many iPhones later, after many projects and hours spent, I'm ready to release my first game that I developed on the same old MacBook I bought 8 years ago.<br/><br/>My initial goal was to make something simple and quick. That wasn\u2019t me. It took me over a year but it became my most personal game with a meaning behind every single detail. Now when I see other people playing the game and their reactions when solving the puzzles they struggled with, I know it was worth it.<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe my game will inspire someone somewhere out there to became a developer as well. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth doing!<br/><br/>THANK YOU FOR ALL SUPPORT!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78adb813754bd036f0450239cce418f.jpg", "website": "http://followthetrail.info", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Grzegorz Pykacz"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Grzegorz Pykacz"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
