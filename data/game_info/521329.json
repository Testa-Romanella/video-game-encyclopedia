Our team, The Debauchery Duo, ended up taking second place out of 6 projects.</p>\n<p>This version of the game is a slightly polished version of the final game jam build, fixing some UX and making the game, ultimately, less tedious.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind why I chose to make a game about myself, Blake 'Kwanton' Blakeslee, was because I knew this was a kind of game that no other team would be able to do, because of two reasons: One, every team had a large amount of people, and having the game be about one person on the team would not work out, this was why I separated from my usual team and only grabbed one other person. Two, no one's self centered enough to suggest a game that is solely about them, not to mention the fear of exploring oneself and showing off the more personal parts that lie in the back of our minds.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Blake Blakeslee - Lead Programmer, Lead Designer<br/>Michael Moylen - Art Director, 3D Modeler</p>\n<p>Special thanks to both Michael Moylen, for spending 30 hours pumping out all of the art from the game, and Stratton Whisler, for being a resource to help with the code of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3a/b3ae00c737dbaf7e1ee7147276e5f88e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kwanton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
