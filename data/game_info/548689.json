You need to get to the <strong>right scene</strong>\u00a0at the <strong>right time</strong>, otherwise, you will miss the plot and the clue in the dialogue.\u00a0Your experience on this day determines what will happen at the end of that day. And you need to find your <strong>OWN WAY</strong>\u00a0out of this loop day.</p>\n<p>The demo video shows the correct answer to the puzzle,\u00a0the left top small screen shows if you failed to show up at the right time.</p>\n<p>HINT: You'll find a <strong>HIDDEN</strong>\u00a0<strong>CLOCK and a LOOPDAY TRACKER\u00a0</strong>in the transition scene UI. The Hidden\u00a0Clock indicates the right time to leave the current scene, with this\u00a0piece of information you could calculate the right\u00a0enter time for this scene.\u00a0\u00a0The number on the Loopday Tracker will tell you how many times you've been stuck in this endless world. Try to find a hidden ending as well. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instruction:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W= Forward Walking, W+Shift = Happy Forward Walking</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A = Left Move, S = Back Move, D = Right Move</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Right = View Control, Mouse Middel = Front View Control</strong></p>\n<p><strong>F = Start Talking (Mouse Left = Next Sentence)/Interact, Space = Jump (Hold Space = Weird Backflip)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESC = Quest Check</strong></p>\n<p>ps. the original video is\u00a0\u3082\u3046\u9650\u754c\u3002\u7121\u7406\u3002\u9003\u3052\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3002</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52f/52f8cbec5e3769202a60bd35fffa33e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mn1shi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
