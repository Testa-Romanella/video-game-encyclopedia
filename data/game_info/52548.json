It took six months to develop the concept and another three months to fine-tune the game. It was released for the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit family in 1983, ported by Glyn Anderson.</p>\n<p>Megamania is similar to Sega's 1981 arcade title Astro Blaster. Both games have nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an \"energy\" meter. Also, the player's ships are remarkably similar in both games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c02aba1b3410731e58d681e250b23cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 2600", "Atari 5200"], "developers": ["Activision"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
