I didn't finish it on time but this current iteration is what I would've uploaded if I was able to upload in time\u00a0(issues with not being able to find SDK when I was doing the build, didn't build it earlier because game was never in a playable state before then XD).\u00a0I worked with a sound designer and music composer Will P who created all the sounds in the game. I plan to polish this game up, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>I plan to put in the rules in the game later, but here are the rules if you wish to try out the game in early development stage.</p>\n<p>Each customer has different waiting times. Some customers are impatient and you have to fulfill their orders quicker, but they would reward you with more points. (Note that the scoring system isn't working properly right now as I wanted to upload the game in its jam state). It will be explained which customer rewards higher in the future. You can hold a maximum of 5 fish at a time.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>E - Interact/Grab fish</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T15:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/174d382dc19e166b8b0315c5c6bced61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ggGam3s"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
