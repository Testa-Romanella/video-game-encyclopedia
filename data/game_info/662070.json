We will discover her 'monster inside' and with your help, she will break free.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to create a complete game from beginning to end. However, time constraints limited the polishing and the creation of a good puzzle. On the other hand, we believe that our idea created a unique mechanic.</p>\n<p>You can interact (F) with lamps, carry the boxes and climb (Space)\u00a0 on them when you're Elena.</p>\n<p>Keys:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>F = Interaction</p>\n<p>Space = Climb (Only available in Elena)</p>\n<p>Used Assets: Animations have been taken from Mixamo.
