You play as our friendly hero Mega Man, who one night discovered a secret cave. Absorbed by its mystery you decide to enter it, yet soon enough you get lost and you have to find your way out of the cave. Will you be the one that will guide Mega man out and help him on his adventure?</p>\n<p><strong>Development Story:</strong> After the Covid-19 pandemic hit my country hard and all the schools shut down i got bored fast and decided to continue a big hobby of mine when i was a kid, which was making games. At first i didn\u2019t even plan to publish this game which was just a project i created to test all the new things that i learned from programming (that explains the random Mega man Character), but i soon got more into programming and decided to publish it in the end. The reason i published this game is because i wanted to see how people would rate it. I had to see if you guys would want more games made by me or if you guys didn't want me to continue doing this. After all programming is just a new learned hobby for me, if you guys think im good at it i might as well continue doing this.</p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<p>[Update #1: coming very soon!]</p>\n<p>- Pause menu</p>\n<p>- Detailed Background</p>\n<p>- New enemies</p>\n<p>- Damage system</p>\n<p>- More levels</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d770617936541450f990bc0521546bc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["derkaiserschmarrn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
