However this only works while there is less than four Geos on the screen.\u00a0</li><li>As mentioned above,\u00a0when the Geos fall below the screen, they won't be lost - they will return to the top again - they will loop like this until you collect them. Meaning that the screen will clog up eventually if you avoid taking too many, which does increase the difficulty!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb3dda36baa0ae0955c39f5d9d1e3a54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aduman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
