Santa broke his back while playing some weird games with Mrs Clause, so you have to take the Santa's sleigh and save Christmas. Just make sure you don't miss too many houses or people will loose the Christmas spirit.<br/>Also, there's some nasty bats that have been hanging around since Halloween so the elves have equipped the sleigh with some spare wrenches that you can throw at them. Be careful and try NOT to hit the bats with the presents otherwise they'll just take them away.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c450f26e4f5a988e33c33789462222ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["prototyp3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
