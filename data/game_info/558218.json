You keep them safe in their own respective pens. However, one day, the slimes started escaping their pens! It is now up to you to control them and put them back where they belong, otherwise it's game over!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left mouse button: Teleport green slimes</p>\n<p>Right mouse button: Teleport orange slimes</p>\n<p>Scroll up / Scroll down\u00a0(mouse wheel): Kill pink slimes (check the arrows on their design to see which direction to scroll in!)</p>\n<p>The purple slimes at the top represent your lives, by the way. When a slime leaves the screen, then you lose a life. Lose all lives and it is game over.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Made with Godot 3.2.3</p>\n<p>Sounds made by me using BFXR</p>\n<p>Art made by me using Pixelorama</p>\n<p>Font made by Zeh Fernando,\u00a0 \"Perfect DOS VGA 437 WIN\"</p>\n<p>Music made by Patrick de Arteaga, \"Common Fight\" (check out his website:</p>\n<p>https://patrickdearteaga.com/chiptune-8-bit-retro/)</p>\r\n\r\nThis game uses Godot Engine, available under the following license:\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2020 Juan Linietsky, Ariel Manzur.
