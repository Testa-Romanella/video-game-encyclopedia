{"id": 480140, "slug": "zumbi-blocks-2", "name": "Zumbi Blocks 2", "name_original": "Zumbi Blocks 2", "description": "<p>Zumbi Blocks 2 is a rogue-lite zombie survival game. You're thrown into a procedurally generated city, infested with zombies.\u00a0You have to scavenge, hunt and take down zombie bosses to acquire better equipment. You'll need the best weapons, vehicles and equipment you can find to defeat the ultimate zombie boss, required to save the city from the infestation.</p>\n<p>It's a strictly PVE game, that can be played in singleplayer mode or COOP multiplayer.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You just have to download it, extract, and run the .exe file. To play the game\u00a0you need to start a multiplayer match, even if you want to play alone.\u00a0I don't recommend playing online right now, cause you'll need a VPN or LAN, and there are plenty of glitches related to online play that i need to fix.</p>\n<p><strong>Development of the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's a sequel to a previous game i made, Zumbi Blocks, launched for free on Kongregate in 2014. Five years later i decided to make a sequel to it. Zumbi Blocks 2 has been in development for about 7 months, and it's being made by one person.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Current state of the project</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Currently the game is in early stages of development and it's missing some core systems, like boss fights, construction of defenses, and vehicles. It's also missing a lot of content. I estimate\u00a0it's will take about a year of development for it to be ready for Steam launch. If i can avoid launching it in early access i will. I don't want to launch an incomplete game.</p>\n<p><strong>Any help is welcome</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'll have an early build of the game free to download, but i need financial support to keep the development going, so\u00a0if you're willing to donate a couple of dollars when downloading it\u00a0i'll be very grateful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b2a32daabd357705bbc874909baf998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Groovy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
