You're just the one who gives commands to the robot's AI brain. The only thing is, the AI doesn't like you. Whenever you try to act, the AI will try to counteract you. It will figure out your goals and stop you, even making you move the wrong way. But it also forgets quickly, so you can change things up to throw it off.\u00a0You need to figure out how the AI works, find the limits of your robot, and practice your control and timing to make it through this out of control puzzle-platformer.</p>\n<p>Some levels are mechanically challenging and, though there are hints, there's little hand-holding for figuring out the more complex mechanics so you will need to think outside the box and really work to understand the robot and the AI.</p><p>Thanks to Anjali Gali for making art for the adorable robot and sparkling portals.</p><p>Special thanks to the Gali Family and to my friends Teddy, Anderson, Jake, and Zetong for help with preliminary artwork and\u00a0designing &amp; testing the game. You all inspired me to do my best!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b738fc3d5a26303002ae99d600bf76da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Khalory"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
