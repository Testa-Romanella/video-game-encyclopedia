It is determined by the time, and once it reaches the required amount of seconds, you beat the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must deal with the obstacles ahead. You can try and dodge the obstacles, but you have other methods as well. Your vehicle is able to fire unlimited energy balls, which can help deal with certain enemies, particularly the \"Toll Riders\", who after colliding with you not only take away your life but will steal currency (which is in \"saturns\") from you as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also run into toolboxes, which will grant you armor to your vehicle. \u00a0You can increase the armor two more times, but they are only effective towards Toll Riders and ghosts (cause they have anti-ghost material on it, don't question it). However, running into them with the armor\u00a0will defeat them instantly, but in exchange, you will lose armor. They are very helpful towards the \"Toll Traps\" which will make you lose 20 \"saturns\" if you ride over them, or else they would make you lose a life.</p>\n<p>Once you get to the store, you can buy rockets, which are useful towards\u00a0almost all obstacles, but you can only get three in one shop.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the store, once you reach your destination, you will get there. In order to buy stuff, you need to collect the \"saturns\" that appear in the level. Just remember that the space government doesn't think this shop is legal with it's rockets and usage of anti-ghost material.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls-</p>\n<p>Key W- Move Up</p>\n<p>Key S- Move Down</p>\n<p>Enter- Selects Option</p>\n<p>Key N- Shoots Energy Ball</p>\n<p>Key M- Shoots Rockets(if you have any)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T14:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7fcfea0fce5a59b66fef96cdc9ae420.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VirtualMini"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
