Her target: a mysterious ancient statuette held by the Chinese ambassador in France. She sees it as a good opportunity to visit her birthplace... But this 'easy' mission is about to lead Hana to something way bigger than she expected.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile Glas is approached by a client who catches his attention enough that he soon sets out for Greenland.<br/> <br/>How will these events bring the old team back together?<br/> <br/>Fear Effect Sedna is dedicated to recreating the atmosphere and characters from the original Fear Effect.
