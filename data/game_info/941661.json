The fortress is protected by rotating, concentric rings of segmented energy shields. You must blast a hole through these shields in order to destroy the fortress. <br/>But watch out! The fortress has rotating turrets that track your ship and fire back at you. In addition, missile launchers around the perimeter of the fortress launches seeking weapons that home in on your fighter. An occasional drone launches from the fortress to chase your ship and fire energy weapons at you. <br/>Watch out for asteroids that pass through the area. Some of them drop useful powerups when destroyed. <br/>Finally, the enemy has activated an energy barrier that prevents you from leaving the area so there's no escape. It's fight or die!<br/>Each time the base is destroyed, you'll face a new, more powerful base with a faster rate of fire and faster projectiles.<br/>How far can you get?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T09:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1daa88bfaae663d4bc5ec1f1220cdf4a_UDaAk7q.jpg", "website": "https://midniteoilsoftware.itch.io/cosmic-space-fortress", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Greg Bradburn"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Greg Bradburn"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
