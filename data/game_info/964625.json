If the player fails to do so, they are punished and must try again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe rules of this game are quite simple.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne player starts by guessing whether the next card will be higher or black. If the player fails to make a correct prediction, they are punished (e.g., take a sip of a drink) and must try again.<br/>\r\nThis continues until the player makes a correct prediction. Once the player has guessed the correct card, they get to choose who will guess the next card.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpecial rules can be found in the game, so there's no need to memorize them separately.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf the deck is empty and players want to continue playing, they can shuffle the cards again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T01:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d83667c5aa88ce3f1929683e5caca56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zashiko"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Zashiko"], "esrb_rating": null}
