More info to follow once Im not sleepy anymore.</p>\n\n<p>(Things to Note: Crates dont really like to be pushed into another, and may occupy each others' spot. To fix this, if possible, try to push the inactive crate to another slot. Alternatively, use [R] to reset the level. Couldnt fix that in time for the Jam, sorry!)<br/></p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Directional Keys]</strong> Move <br/><strong>[E</strong><strong>]</strong> Interact with other (rescued) Sheep<br/><strong>[R]</strong> Reset Level/Section<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Code]</strong> Sebastian B\u00e4hring<br/><strong>[Sprites/Art &amp; Music]</strong> Cindy Neugebauer (Twitter)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/2597e97b03d9c0a860917c07dd59a108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yauxo", "Milkyrisa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
