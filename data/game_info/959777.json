One of the most famous representatives of the \u201cDo It Yourself\u201d artistic movement aka DIY. Born May 11, 1994 in the city of Florence, Italy, in the family of a wealthy lawyer. <br/><br/>As a child, Vict\u00f3r was a quick-witted, but uncontrollable child. Once in the marketplace he started a scandal so intence, that a huge crowd gathered around, and the police even had to ask the owner of the shop to open it during the siesta to give the boy a candy. Whims, persuasion \u2014 you name it, Vict\u00f3r always attracted attention and sought to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>Like many creative persons, he was a \"strange\" child, which prevented him from making friends. Classmates often bullied Vict\u00f3r and even slipped grasshoppers behind his collar, which he was terribly afraid of! But art was always a salvation, and Vict\u00f3r plunged headlong into it\u2026<br/><br/>At the age of six already, the boy showed an interest in drawing, and the kindness of his parents played into his hands: he was even allocated a whole room for a workshop, clearing the laundry room in the attic from rubbish. Here he painted the surroundings all day long, and at the age of ten he created his first impressionist oil painting! Four years later, his work was already being shown to the public at the city exhibition in Florence, and three years later \u2014 in Rome!<br/><br/>In DIY Projects, you play as an eccentric design genius \u2014 Vict\u00f3r and help him bring all the most cherished desires and projects to life!
