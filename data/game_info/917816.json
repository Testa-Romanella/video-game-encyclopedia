While I was recovering from coronavirus, I binge-watched a huge amount of movies and TV Shows, including an animated series where a mad scientist and his assistant have crazy adventures. In one of those adventures, the mad scientist gave to his assistant a pair of special boots that stick to any surface... The fever and an absurd amount of medication gave life to this idea, which is now today \u201cThe Helper\u201d.  This video game includes several references to TV Shows and movies, those who were with me on my moment of sickness.Features<br/>- 80 handcrafted Levels<br/>- 4 Worlds inspired by movies and TV Shows<br/>- Keyboard + Controller Support<br/>- Tons of easy-to-get-but-hard-to-win achievements!<br/>- ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T04:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/5491e3d6f4f7184809a1f0d8c09fc7b5.jpg", "website": "https://scoutgamestudios.com/the-helper", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scout Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scout Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
