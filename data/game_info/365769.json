{"id": 365769, "slug": "mor", "name": "MOR", "name_original": "MOR", "description": "\n<p>Set in the Swedish archipelago in the 70s, take the role of 17-year old Linn as she returns to the island where she almost drowned as a child.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>After a fight with her mother, Linn is left alone in the family's old summer home. There she finds an old spirit board, through which she finds herself communicating with Mikael, a strange entity with a secret it desperately wants to share with her.</p>\n\n<p>Mikael will lead you on an increasingly bizarre treasure hunt through the island. You will be forced to rely on your wits and creativity to decipher the spirit board's cryptic clues - and to piece together a disturbing mystery about Linn's past that does not seem consistent with her own memories.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But you may also be forced to ask yourself a more pressing question: is Mikael really trying to help Linn - or to kill her.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>MOR was created as a school project over the course of 10 weeks, by a team of game development students at the University of Sk\u00f6vde.
