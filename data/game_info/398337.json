You play as a black-hat hacker who receives a tip about a mega corporation security loop hole. In this futuristic cyber dystopia, surely it's not a trap... Right?</p>\n<p>Spoiler, this is tagged \"Action\" for a reason! Lucky for you, you've got a cute little drone friend that shoots wherever you're looking at!</p>\n<p>Your outfit isn't just for looks either. You're kitted with the latest and greatest cybernetic abilities. You've recently upgraded your armor to version 1.47. Code name\u00a0Oppressive Pace (OP for short).\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can <strong>Dash </strong>away from enemies if needed, or <strong>Dash\u00a0</strong><em>toward</em> them taking advantage of the corrosive side effects your emission particles has on metal! You can also\u00a0<strong>Crash\u00a0</strong>which emits a powerful explosion, wiping out anyone around you.\u00a0 When you're fully charged up, you can activate\u00a0<strong>Overdrive\u00a0</strong>which temporarily doubles your fire rate, movement speed, enables invulnerability\u00a0<em>and </em>you get\u00a0<strong>UNLIMITED\u00a0</strong>Ability use!<br/></p>\n<p>But wait, there's\u00a0<em>more</em><em>!</em>\u00a0\u00a0Your Abilities, Health and Drone can all be upgraded using spare mechanical parts.\u00a0<em>If only there were hundreds of robots waiting to be destroyed....</em></p>\n<p>There are three waves in the three levels. You can upgrade in between each wave. By the end of the game, you're an unstoppable robot killing machine.</p>\n<p><strong>DualShock 4 Controls (Recommended!)
