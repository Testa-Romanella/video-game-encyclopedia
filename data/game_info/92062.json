Drop it by letting go of the mouse click.</li><li>The powerCore will activate turrets around it; and can also be used to activate the buttons.\u00a0</li><li>The powerCore will stun enemies around it when dropped on the ground.\u00a0</li><li>Stunned enemies will take extra damage.</li><li>When enemies are killed, they will drop power nodes. Drop the powerCore near these nodes to collect them. This will increase your power meter which can then be used to charge up the Rocket or build new turrets at the Turret Factory.\u00a0You can do this by dropping the powerCore on the buttons next to these objects.</li><li>When a new turretPackage spawns, it can be picked up much like the powerCore and dropped on the ground. When it sits firmly on the ground, it will spawn a turret.</li><li>The goal of the game is to charge up the Rocket and escape.</li></ul>\n<p>That's pretty much it, thanks for checking it out :)</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54ab50a73bf0e988d5df658e024a125f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sanjeev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
