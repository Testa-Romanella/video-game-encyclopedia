Do you copy?<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Our team here at the Galactic Space Union are attempting to figure out your current condition.\u00a0</em><em>I know this sounds ridiculous, it seems like you have been superimposed between two different realities.</em></p>\n<p>Project Alpha is a rogue-like shooter with maps generated randomly using quantum computation. In the spirit of quantum superposition, the player is\u00a0superimposed between two\u00a0realities.\u00a0The\u00a0player has to simultaneously control both versions of the character and proceed trough the rooms killing all Alpha Centaurians. The goal of the game\u00a0is to find and kill the Centaurian Leader before the aliens\u00a0kill you.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong>:\u00a0WASD<br/><strong>Aiming &amp;\u00a0Shooting</strong>:\u00a0mouse &amp;\u00a0left button click<br/>Both characters move and shoot simultaneously\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0they both aim\u00a0towards the mouse position.</p>\n<p>The game is won by exiting the boss room after clearing it.<br/></p>\n<p><em>For exploration,<br/></em><em>For liberty,<br/></em><em>For the Galactic Space Union!</em></p>\n<p><em>Good luck, explorer!</em></p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>This project was done as part of\u00a0Quantum Games (QG) course ran by Aalto University. Feel free to check the course website for more information about the course and to see other projects:\u00a0https://quantumgames.aalto.fi/game-projects/.</p>\r\nMethods &amp;\u00a0Tools\r\n<p>Project Alpha uses IBM's real quantum computers to generate seeds for the level generation. The calculations are done on a server to which the game makes API requests to. The server is written in python and uses Qiskit to interact with the IBM quantum computers.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game engine</strong>: Unity 2020.3.3f1<br/><strong>Art</strong>: Aseprite<br/><strong>Sound</strong> <strong>effects</strong>: sfxia</p>\r\nCredits\r\nProject Team\r\n<p>Miro Aurela:\u00a0Programming, Map Generation<br/>Marc Berta:\u00a0Programming, Enemy Scripting<br/>Aaron Campbell: Programming, Quantum Computing<br/>Lucas Huang: Writer<br/>Leo Peltola: Programming, Art &amp; Sound effects, Server<br/>Tom Railio:\u00a0Choosing music</p>\r\nBackground music\r\n<p>Futuristic Suspense Ambient<br/>tyops</p>\n<p>Epic Orchestra - LOOP.wav<br/>Joshua Empyr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b911468767199911d65caad7805fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lrdazrl", "leopeltola", "MarcellBerta", "Aaron-R-Campbell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
