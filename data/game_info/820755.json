Every asset and gameplay were made during 48h alongside my friend <em>GoZ</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>The rule of <em>Random Encounter of the Third Kind </em>is quite simple: <strong>survive</strong>. The game will scale automatically in difficulty so beware! (though you'll eventually become unstoppable...)</p>\n<p>All you need to play is a mouse and keyboard (you can use a controller but you can only move with it... maybe you'll like the challenge):</p>\n<ul><li>Forward: <em>W</em></li><li>Backward: <em>S</em></li><li>Shoot: <em>Left Mouse Click</em></li><li>Pause: <em>Escape<br/></em></li><li>[ Hidden feature - Jump: <em>Space</em> ]</li><li>Game Over: <em>Don't do anything<br/></em></li></ul>\n<p><em>(The player will automatically follow the mouse cursor on the screen)<br/></em></p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy this game as much as we enjoyed making it! Everybody have a glorious day!</p>\n<p>Cheers!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/636f1e415958dc38e4926b4902f781a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PtitPoly"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
