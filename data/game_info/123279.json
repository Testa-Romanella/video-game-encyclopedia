If people like it, I may expand it with a GMS or Unity port. More ideas I'd like to explore include more waves with new TIE attack patterns, TIE Bombers to drop bombs (if you pick it up before it explodes, you can fire it as a weapon?), Star Destroyer boss fights, a \"retro mode\" true to 1981 arcade graphics, and Empire and Jedi sequels might be fun. What would you like to see added? Leave a comment below!<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy my stuff?
