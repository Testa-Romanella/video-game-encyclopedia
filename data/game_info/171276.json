Don't blame me for heart attack :p)<br/>True Love is a short horror RPG I made using RPG Maker XP. The story is about a girl madly in love with her senpai, named Yuki. However, it is said that he has to hide for a reason to be discovered. Playing as the main character, you have to follow a trail left behind by Yuki, telling his love story and secret. <br/></p><p>This game includes a few jump scares and ghost chase. <br/>A normal gameplay is around 10-30 minutes. <br/> It includes 3 different ending depending on the route the player takes. Though, getting all endings at least once is highly recommended. <br/></p><p>Overall, this is a very short horror game mainly based on the story line. <br/>This game is entirely made by me using the graphics and audio from RPG Maker XP, using my own drawings to complete it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5b88381f6460b28a4ec888ed578a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yuukinokai"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
