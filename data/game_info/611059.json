Former Russian Empire is torn apart by two opposing factions - Bolsheviks and Monarchist White Movement. The Soviets are winning, any battle actions seems pointless now. The land is in ruins, people are starving. Some dirty arms dealer named Srilenko is trying to reignite this bloody conflict and end up rich! You are a secret agent with nearly impossible mission to stop this maniac and save millions of people!</p>\n<p>This game is made for low-end PCs - even some oldie like\u00a0Pentium 4 should be enough. It's tested on 128 MB Video Card - runs OK, but I'll recommend using more powerful one. It only needs 500 MB on HDD.</p>\n<p>This game is FREE and can't be sold at any price! It's just a product of some leisure-time and a little imagination.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>The Game Creators - FPS Creator Engine</p>\n<p>A. I.
