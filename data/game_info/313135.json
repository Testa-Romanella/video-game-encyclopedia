Start your turn by clicking on the deck to be dealt your cards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Drag cards over enemies to play them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Press the next arrow to end your turn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Defense (or completely negates) incoming damage.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are three ways to regain health:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. At the end of your turn you gain +1 health (this can be upgraded).</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Blocking all incoming damage is likely to drop some health</p>\n<p>3. Killing an enemy gives you health.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are three classes of enemies:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1, Brutes are basic guys who on average has higher attack than other classes,\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Healers can heal their allies on their turn</p>\n<p>3. Tanks have a lot of health but generally low attack</p>\n\n<p>Moving the slider around increases a multiplier that increases the damage and health cost to play defensive and offensive cards. This is useful because of how the game gets harder as it goes on, but it is ultimately not a great mechanic that it would replace with a full upgrade system if I had time.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Okay, I think that's all. Hope you enjoy it (at least somewhat) and sorry for the lack of music, poor art, and problematic difficultly curve.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/4507c75d5f1803a455affec4853fc41b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wrimor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
