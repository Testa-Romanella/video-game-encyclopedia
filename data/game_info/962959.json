It is him who created the story of Yanus \u2013 a private investigator with a troubled past, now trying to solve an unexpected case revolving around a stolen data carrier, all this while fighting his own inner demons, the urban gangs and a nigh-omnipotent corporation responsible for the downfall of the city he used to call his own.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe game offers solid combat and movement systems, as well as a modular weapon upgrade system, thanks to which the players striding through the dark corners of the city may make every encounter feel and look different. Action-packed levels with stealth elements, hacking and environmental puzzle solving are intertwined with more slow-paced sequences of city exploration, side quests and storytelling.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nA unique, inherently Slavic take on the cyberpunk world is sure to leave none indifferent thanks to its sharp, caustic sense of humour and a slightly pessimistic outlook at the neon-grey shades of the surrounding reality, at the same time providing a much needed breath of fresh air to the genre itself.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nAs a team, the question we asked ourselves was: what was the world going to look like in a couple of decades? How would a hypothetical Central and Eastern European city and its inhabitants differ from, say, Blade Runner \u2018s L.A. or Akira\u2019s Neo Tokyo?\u201d.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe attempts to answer this puzzle has had a tremendous deal of influence upon the game\u2019s artistic choices, including a mix of futuristic-esque and overly outdated technologies, the grim, brutalist architecture typical of the post-communist countries, the character\u2019s not-so-obvious moral choices and the often crudely makeshift, yank-and-tuck character and atmosphere of an environment overpacked with people forced to cope with the uneven distribution of goods and wealth, often relying on their wits and sheer luck to make it to the next paycheck without losing their minds.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSlavicPunk story goes to show that there is more than meets the eye to this dystopian version of the future is, and it is only up to the players to discover what lies beneath the neon glow and the concrete streets \u2013 helping Yanus unravel his last case and find out just how brutal and ugly the truth may actually be.\n<br/><br/>\n\nOriginal Sountrack for SlavicPunk: Oldtimer produced and composed by Patryk Scelina<br/>\n<br/>\nTrack List:\n<ol>\n<li>Main Theme</li>\n<li>Welcome to My City</li>\n<li>Looking for Rodent</li>\n<li>Here Comes Heavy</li>\n<li>Good to See You</li>\n<li>Gathering the Intel</li>\n<li>Ongoing Investigation</li>\n<li>You Ain't Gonna Get Me</li>\n<li>Sonia's Gratitude</li>\n<li>Getting Angry</li>\n<li>SynthAd Voyages</li>\n<li>Come Get Some</li>\n<li>I Am All You Are Not</li>\n<li>Into the Fire</li>\n<li>Get Out of My Way</li>\n<li>Help Me</li>\n<li>The Way to the Top</li>\n<li>Solving the Investigation</li>\n<li>What the F... ?</li>\n<li>Gonna Kick Your Ass</li>\n<li>Gun Dance</li>\n</ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T05:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce4171d5352b55b2a70724b8decdd7db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Square Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Red Square Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
