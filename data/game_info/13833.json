Game events begin in 1066, but there are often no time limits, so theoretically, missions can last dozens and even hundreds of game years.</p>\n<h3>The path of war and the path of peace</h3>\n<p>The game allows you to build - a settlement or a castle, carry out individual economic missions or just build freely, and destroy - invade the country, take the castle under siege or, on the contrary, crush the attackers. You can create your own maps and play in multiplay mode.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>You are the ruler of the castle, you are responsible for both the economy and the war. Do not forget about the popularity - it&#39;s a separate indicator in the game.</p>\n<p>You can build six types of buildings:<br />\nthe castle and everything inside it - walls, towers, gates, barracks, ditches, etc.,<br />\nsawmills, quarries, mines and other structures for extraction of resources - wood, stone, iron and oil.<br />\nFarms that bring meat, milk, wheat, apples, hops, skins of cows,<br />\ncity \u200b\u200bbuildings - houses, churches, wells,<br />\nWeapon workshops, where they produce weapons and armor,<br />\nBarns and shops for cheese, bread, ale</p>\n<p>Buildings are built instantly, it is only necessary to make such a decision. Just as quickly your soldiers are trained. But all this requires money obtained from the collection of taxes and trade.</p>\n<p>To succeed in the economy it is not enough just to make calculations. We have to cope with unpredictable disasters like the invasion of rabbits or fire.</p>\n<p>The war is fought by soldiers of close combat and distant combat: archers, crossbowmen, pikemen, swordsmen, spearmen, knights and even monks with clubs.</p>\n<p>Troops can shoot from towers, move around walls, destroy walls, use siege machines, including towers, while besieged have boiling resin tanks, pits with stakes and moats with water. You can dig trenches and even organize an epidemic in the enemy camp. For complex actions, except soldiers, you need to involve sappers and engineers.</p>\n<h3>Addition Stronghold Crusader HD</h3>\n<p>Expands the set of game situations with the stories of the Crusades:<br />\nThe first crusade of 1094-1099,<br />\nSaladin&#39;s campaigns of 1187,<br />\nthe expedition of Richard the Lionheart, Friedrich Barbarossa and the French Philip II in order to liberate Jerusalem</p>\n<p>The way of the crusader is a campaign of 50 cards not tied to historical events, but in the same setting.</p>\n<p>One of the unique innovations are the assassins - the warriors of special abilities, able to invisibly enter the castle and open the gate from the inside, interrupting the guard.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2002-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T13:57:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/1258337895195f87eb5465eb9d5d5596.jpg", "website": "http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 82, "owned": 1633, "beaten": 112, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 92, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 230, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 230, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["FireFly Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["FireFly Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
