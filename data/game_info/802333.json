{"id": 802333, "slug": "the-listener-onporpoise", "name": "The Listener (OnPorpoise)", "name_original": "The Listener (OnPorpoise)", "description": "<p>The Listener is a first-person walking simulator game where you\u00a0have the ability to hear (but not see) events that happened in the past, and are working to uncover what happened to two people staying at a motel.\u00a0You are a private detective hired by the authorities to investigate a mysterious murder at a motel, where DNA involved in a missing person\u2019s case was found. Your supernatural ability to listen to the echoes of past conversations reveals the anxieties of the two people staying in that motel room, and their story, but also gets you more than you bargained for.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>At least, that was what this game was going to be.</p>\n<p>To be honest, things didn't really come together here. If I had another week to work on this, I would probably be able to get the game to work more smoothly, but as it's for a class assignment and I'm going to be busy this summer, I think I'm just going to have to leave it here. I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who contributed to this game, and I apologize for its poor quality. I mostly see this as a learning experience, but thank you for playing anyways. View this more as a \"proof of concept\" or a \"demo\" of what a full game with this concept would be.</p>\n\n\n<p>Use WASD to move, Space to jump, and Shift to Sprint. Use headphones for the best experience. Walk into distortions to \"listen\" to the past.</p>\n\n<p>Music and sound by Malia Mohrman.
