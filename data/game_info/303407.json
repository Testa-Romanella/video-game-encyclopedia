As the world around you develops, your task is to ensure the survival of all species (Humans, Plants, Herbivores, and Carnivores). If any species becomes extinct, you lose!</p>\n<p>You have 3 powers at your disposal. Use Create to turn the desert into grass tiles, Grow to grow plants, and use Destroy to destroy all nearby life and convert tiles to desert. Be careful - your powers will alter everything within range!</p>\n<p>When life is in equilibrium, and no species are endangered, Nature is content (\u201cnormal mode\u201d). In this mode, your range is approximately 2 tiles away from your crosshairs. However, when one species becomes endangered, Nature becomes enraged (\u201crage mode\u201d), causing your range and powers to be amplified by approximately 300%, affecting everything within 5 tiles of your crosshairs.</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys<br/>Fine Tuned Movement: Mouse<br/>Create: C or P<br/>Grow: X or O<br/>Destroy: Z or I</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad457c46fb250d446a4495b1596ed458.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Alic Szecsei", "hekemp"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
