Everyone will hunt the host player while the host tries to collect every pellet on the screen. The host is also going to play a top-down version of the game while everyone else is playing from a third person viewpoint. The host gains health from eating the other players, but also losses health when getting eaten by players. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDoesn't seem to work for everyone, I had to mess around with UPNP settings on my router to let the game run normally.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T04:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237564b5c37d244c8f276c796fbcd866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Take A Nuke"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Group of Goblins"], "esrb_rating": null}
