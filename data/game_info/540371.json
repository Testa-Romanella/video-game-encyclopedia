This tutorial uses Construct 3 but the concepts are applicable across game engines. In this tutorial, I cover how to plan out your goals, actions, weights, preconditions, and results and them implement them in the engine with a pseudo code walk through. I encourage you to download the file (see construct 3 file below - note that\u00a0art is removed as I do not have license to share so it is replaced with beautiful squares)\u00a0and follow along / tinker to consider how you can implement in your games!\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to use however, no credit needed, cc0 etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out the YouTube video below and let me know what you think - Subscribe if you enjoy, would make my day :)</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS FOR DEMO GAME:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Since this is a game about automating game characters / a\u00a0skeleton horde... your only controls are pretty simple:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Blue button: Toggles text visibility of current \"Goal\", \"State\", and \"Action Plan\" to help understand what the AI is doing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Red Button: Summon a boss for your ever growing horde to swarm and destroy :).\u00a0 Bosses get stronger each time they are summoned!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2bb26cf12ec2d5c66709de597a22429.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoozleCC"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
