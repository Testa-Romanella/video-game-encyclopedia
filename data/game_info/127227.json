We sent our best people to space, to live in an autonomous station. It became about salvation, our civilization was lost, all that was left, was now drifting away from Earth. That too would come to an end. Even with infinite resources, all perished, generations later. All hope was lost, until the last trace of our people emerged. The code made to control the machines scattered across the solar system evolved, keeping the mission alive. It was too soon to begin reconstruction, the Sun was still too bitter for life, so the machines waited, turned themselves down for centuries. Now the cycle of waiting was over, the machines are awake once again and is up to you, the collective mind of a lost civilization, to coordinate their efforts in building life from scratch. Gathering resources from planets, moons and asteroids, you can put together the key ingredients to life and maybe, see a new civilization rise to reclaim their place in the universe.</p><p>Idle Space Miner 2 have been developed over a year and has being previously published on Kongregate, with almost 10k plays and awesome feedback from the community. Recently the game hit a milestone, where WebGL couldn't hold it's processing and graphical needs, so I decided to launch it independently as a standalone for PC.<br/><br/>By buying a copy right now, you'll be getting access to a rough version still in development, but will also grant you access to future versions of the game. Also, it'll help me to keep developing and adding art, content, music and features to the game, making it better. But wait, there's more. As a solo developer, I'm passionate about my players and want to give you the best experience possible, so by participating of the project at such an early stage you'll be very special to me, gaining not only gifts related to the game (to be defined yet), but additional keys for friends, and also exclusive supporter report, where I shall talk to my most special players about the plans for development and early access to new builds, experiments and other games that I'll certainly launch in the future.</p><p>To play it's beta on Kongregate, just click the link below<br/>https://www.kongregate.com/games/BRdaquino/beta-test-idle-space-miner-2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/3056af192925a915f0d5c0b906e723bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daquino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
