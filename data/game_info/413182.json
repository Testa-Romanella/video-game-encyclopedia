As an Engine I used the Unity Engine. All the Pixel Art is drawn by myself with the PixilArt Website, as well as all the Animations. The music is generated via. Ecrett Music and all other Sound Effects are made with Bosca Coeil. Because the theme of the Game Jam is \"Holes\", I sketched multiple ideas one being a Golf Game, but recognised that this won't be distinct enough. So I stuck with my idea to create a Game inspired by Simon Says but with a flute, where you have to drill the holes into the flute to replay the sound wanted.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Left Click\u00a0</strong>\ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8b027fb827b46a72fba0f2aa2a6cce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CrackIT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
