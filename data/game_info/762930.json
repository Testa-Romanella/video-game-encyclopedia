Freyborough is as welcoming and nostalgic as ever, with a friendly community where humans and the supernatural live in harmony. It\u2019s perfect!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, that is until you get attacked by a vampire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Freyborough is supposed to be the safest place around, nothing can get in the way of a feral vampire. Unfortunately, instead of enjoying your summer like you\u2019d hoped, you have a month until an affliction takes your body and you succumb to vampirism. But, luckily for you there are a few kind people who want to help\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>A Moonlit Summer</em> demo is just the beginning of a fantasy dating sim set in the modern world:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 There are <strong>four possible love interests</strong> for you to invest in! Two men and two women.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Each love interest is a different species: human, werewolf, vampire and nymph.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Each route is accessible regardless of your gender.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 You can choose your name and customise your personal pronouns!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 This game is <strong>asexual</strong> friendly. You can initiate an asexual romance or just stay friends \u2014 it\u2019s your call.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 A unique world you can learn about and explore as the story goes on: try every route to learn as much as you can!</p>\n<p><strong>For this demo, we have included the prologue and first act where you will meet and interact with all possible love interests. Ready to meet them?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sophia Amery</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love brains <em>and </em>brawn? Sophia is a junior doctor at the local hospital who seems to have taken a liking to your biology. She\u2019s an incredibly smart individual, but just a little socially awkward\u2026 However, there\u2019s a lot more to discover than just her fascination with vampirism: after all, spending the summer in a hospital can\u2019t be that bad!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Aurora Chanalet\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Pink, pink and more <em>pink</em>! Aurora is quite the opposite of a stereotypical vampire who enjoys brooding and hiding under umbrellas. She loves to be outside, under the sun and loves to bake. Although a little overbearing and excitable at times, there\u2019s plenty to love about Aurora \u2014 spending time in the sun with her might be just what you need.</p>\n<p><strong>Lars Wulfric</strong></p>\n<p>Scruffy, grumpy <em>and </em>handsome \u2014 what more could you want? Lars is a werewolf who takes his heritage seriously, enjoying the simpler things in life like nature and literature. Even though his hatred towards vampires is pretty solid, maybe you can change his mind. Underneath that grouchy exterior is a man who\u2019s a soft pup at heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Vitus Linett\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>A shy, quiet nymph with a lot of weight bearing on his shoulders. Vitus isn\u2019t here to stay for very long, so you might never get the chance to meet a nymph again. He\u2019s breaking the status quo of nymph-kind and exploring the noisy world beyond the forest, and <em>you </em>could be the first to show him the best of humanity.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to follow this page for updates and for announcements on the full release of the game. What there is to expect from the full version:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Four fully playable routes.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Drawn backgrounds and sprites.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 A unique soundtrack.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing, and please be sure to leave a rating and review!
