Migrants face challenges and advisory to end up in an unknown place. Some walls are scalable, some are breakable and some you must go under. You can move some walls, indicated by the direction in which they will flow. AWD/Arrow keys are used for control and the space bar for jumping.</p><p>Best played in full screen mode 1920 x 1080</p><p>Credits:</p><p><strong>Nich Mebane</strong> - Design, Sound Design, Art, Programming www.nichmebane.com</p><p><strong>Jeremy Lowther</strong> - Art http://www.jeremylowther.com/</p><p><strong>Johnathan Pardue </strong>- Design, Programming</p><p>Main Character: http://opengameart.org/content/cat-dog-free-sprites</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f70/f70b5668d7fd38a6581bddb334ea29fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sweet_niche"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
