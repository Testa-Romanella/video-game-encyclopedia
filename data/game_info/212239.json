Compelled by either malice or some sense of performative alternative-ness, you take it upon yourself to clap as loud as you can to the music -- out of beat!</p>\n<p>Use any key to clap, and listen carefully to the background music to make sure you're decidedly out of time. Out-of-time claps will help fill the Chaos Meter, in-time claps (matching any eighth-note beat) will take a chunk out of the Meter, as will waiting long enough for the audience to settle down.\u00a0Fill up the Chaos Meter and the concert will be totally ruined!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<ul><li>Any key or mouse button - Clap!</li></ul>\n<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p>\n<ul><li>Game made using Unity</li><li>All art made using Pixen</li><li>Background music and sound effects\u00a0made with Garageband and Audacity</li><li>Cover image made using Microsoft Powerpoint</li><li>Game title by my sister Colleen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/8127f97b8e5eccc112168e462c66d8b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Greg Szypko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
