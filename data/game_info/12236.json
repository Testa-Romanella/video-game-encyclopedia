Welcome to the Museum's Second Floor!<strong><br/><br/>See new sculptures, ride the elevator, check out the Caf\u00e9, and enjoy the new Water Lilies exhibition.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Welcome to The VR Museum of Fine Art, Steam's finest art gallery.</strong><br/><br/>Depending on who you ask, of course.<br/><br/>If you've been training to be a space pirate and building fantastical contraptions all day, the Museum is your ticket to a well-deserved break. Surround yourself with 1:1 scale sculptures and paintings, and we won't tell anybody if you touch the merchandise! No rope barriers or glass walls here. Feel free to explore the artwork however you see fit. Roomscale VR lets you walk around, duck under, and even hug the life-sized figures.<br/><br/>The initial release of The VR Museum includes 15 high-fidelity sculptures, and more are coming. In addition, two famous paintings are included, scanned and rendered in crisp detail. In future releases, both collections of sculpture and paintings are sure to expand. The artwork is arranged thoughtfully into four exhibits, each with its own theme. <br/><br/>If you ever actually feel like learning something, informative holographic plaques are placed next to each piece of art. That does involve reading, though, and that's a lot of work.<br/><br/>Tickets are free, drinks are temporarily non-existent, and the artwork is pristine. Enjoy!</strong></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T10:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990edeac33644cbd9f831dc144f947c4.jpg", "website": "https://polarsoftware.wordpress.com", "rating": 2.7, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 269, "beaten": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Finn Sinclair"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Finn Sinclair"], "esrb_rating": null}
