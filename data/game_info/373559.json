Didn't get that 3 star score? Repeat.<br/></li><li> Unleash your creativity: If you can bend the rules of physics and game design to find unusual routes to the goal, then fine, you win.<br/></li><li> Ultra-realistic physics: No-compromise swing mechanics. We even threw fun out the window for the sake of realism.<br/></li><li> Master the skills: That wall ain't going to avoid you hitting itself.
