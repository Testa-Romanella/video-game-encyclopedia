And i am planning to release it one day. This prototype is the first one i made in one week. The concept is a game about a lost scientist in a lab with a monster that evoles by dying. The first stage (the prototype) It can see, and you need to block its vision by smoke. And kill it, you need to kill it because you can only acces doors by putting a sample in of the monster (why idk). Second stage it can only hear. And last stage it can feel with tentacles. And maybe a last stage with al ability's. The monster art will change and the level looks/layout a bit. Also what you have to do wil change a bit. Demo of the game will be out as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>You can always donate to support the project :)<br/></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>Movement: W, A S, D</p><p>Flashlight: F</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong><br/></p><p>- Find Hamer</p><p>- Destroy pipe with hammer to make monster blind</p><p>- kill monster from behind</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e524ff0c896c4312807c2f0c9cc275f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snellepizzaman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
