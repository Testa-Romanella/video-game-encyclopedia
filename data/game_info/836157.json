I hope you enjoy the game and if it coincides with the theme, enjoy!\r\nP.s. the game is still in working progress to fix some bugs*\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n<p>In this game there are 12 puzzle levels and your task to complete is to look for the three basic colors which are: red, blue and green.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These colors are the skills of your block and with these you will be able to color yourself in the respective color you get.</p>\n<p>For example, if you take the color red, you can color yourself red. But what good will it do for me to have this ability of red?\r\nNow I'll explain it to you.\r\nIn practically every level (apart from the first one) there are 3 colored doors, one red, one green and one blue. If you have the color skill of its respective colored door, you will be able to get past it, otherwise not.</p>\n<p>So maybe you will find yourself in the situation of having to go through doors to find abilities to be able to pass others (doors).<br/>And when you have obtained all the abilities you will have to find a red button that will activate a basket in which you will have to enter to go to the next level..</p>\n<p>Down here i put some other stuff that you have to know ...</p>\n<strong>ABILITIES</strong>\r\nCollectibles:\r\n<ul><li>Red ability - Color the player to red</li><li>Green ability -\u00a0Color the player to green</li><li>Blue ability -\u00a0Color the player to blue</li><li>Mega jump - Increase the value of the jump force</li></ul>\r\nAlready of the player:\r\n<ul><li>White ability - Color the player to white (original color)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Downscaling player ability - Downscaling the player size to\u00a0go to the tightest places and in addition it decreases the mass, so you can jump higher. <br/>BUT THIS ABILITY ALSO TAKES LIFE IF YOU USE IT !!!</li></ul>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Horizontal movements - <strong>AD / Horizontal arrows</strong></li><li>Jump - <strong>Space</strong></li><li>Dash - <strong>Right Click</strong>\u00a0</li><li>Downscaling player ability - <strong>S</strong></li><li>Color to red - <strong>R</strong></li><li>Color to green - <strong>G</strong></li><li>Color to blue - <strong>B</strong></li><li>Color to white - <strong>W</strong></li><li>Escape from the level - <strong>Escape</strong></li><li>Restart the level - <strong>L</strong></li></ul>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<ul><li>Development - EasyGames Studio</li><li>Music - Kevin MacLeod</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T12:39:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c384c2a619e9f62dedf4202e259387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EasyGames Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
