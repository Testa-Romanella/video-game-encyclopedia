And who tf is Sepore?!</strong>\n<p><strong>SeporeGettinFunky</strong> is a project of mine that takes off the main image of my perfect FNF game. I like to code, so I'd thought it'd be fun to try, but one thing led to another and POP! I have my own game now sooo yeah, that's fun. This game has a lot to offer with its customizations, (thanks to Psych Engine)\u00a0but also with updates coming along the way. \u00a0Check the Devlogs occasionally because I do update this game quite frequently adding new characters, songs, and much more. I won't spoil anymore as you must be the one to see its features (and exciting future updates) for yourself. As for who I am, just a random \"Funker\" trying to make it right in place on the planet's social order and obviously, I like FNF.\u00a0Have a good one!</p><p>NOTE: This game does sometimes use other mods' assets\u00a0and stuff like that to ensure good content and a overall mainstream of mods within the same game, whilst I work in the background of course.\u00a0If you are a mod developer and you want your mod assets removed from the game, (If they are present)\u00a0I will gladly do so, and find a work around to the change. And for those who are good at recommendations, I will also take recommendations into account via the comments section for more content.</p>\n<strong>How does this game work?</strong>\n<p>The way this game works is within the Mod Menu (yes there's a mod menu), other/extra weeks can be enabled and disabled, however there is a lock system in place for these extra weeks. Each individual week found within that menu unlocks when you beat a specific week, but some extra weeks have no lock and can be played from the get-go.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Now, instead of doing the game correctly, you can cheat.\u00a0You can just enable the week and go into Freeplay to play without needing to unlock the week, but I feel the fun of challenge or something like that gets taken out, so I HIGHLY recommend playing Freeplay AFTER you've beaten the weeks normally in Story Mode. (I mainly added this feature for content creators who just want to play for the video with no hassles).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T15:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a03/a033cab12a9070ee988764b5ab0c2073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeporesFunkin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
