Starting with a small flame your goal is to keep the fire alive take it around the level using different materials and tools and finally to ignite the bonfire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has been developed within less than two days for the GMTK Game Jam 2020. I have been participating as a one-man team and tried to play around with this experimental mechanic, therefore the game is still in a prototype stage. Since I\u00a0thought the fire mechanics turned out to be quite fun, I will certainly develop it further, add more levels and variety and polish it in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:46:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62d5a200e8e6989363a8027b2a518770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dominikhackl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
