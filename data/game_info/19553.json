In doing so, you'll learn more about them, the true nature of the university, and yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEidolon University has a 2-3 hour playtime but no two playthroughs will ever be the same due to extensive dialogue options and as many as sixteen unique endings per character.  You play as a new student at Eidolon university. As you interact with the other students (by clicking on them in whatever order you choose), you will have extensive branching dialogue options that unlock new areas, raise affection, and unlock special endings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis download includes the full game, free to play, with no additional content expansions anticipated.
