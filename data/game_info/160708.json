This game was made at the VGDC 2016 game jam, the theme for which was, \"You're doing it wrong.\" As such, your loot isn't gathered to be sold, or to be used, but just to add to the size of your mighty lootsack. This was also the first game that all three of the developers worked on, having never written a line of code or made a single asset before.</p>\n<p>Move left and right\u00a0with the A and D keys, jump with K, and swing your lootsack with L.</p>\n<p>I did the programming and level design for this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000c1548d315a8728fcea72e0202ccf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raining Sideways"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
