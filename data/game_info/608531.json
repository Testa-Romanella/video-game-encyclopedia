It's a clone of Pang for PC and Android, there are 5 levels (more can be added quite easily, thanks Unity) and local 2 player option (PC only). The graphics are just basic shapes and there's no sound, and I don't think I'll be expanding on this. It took 2 days to put together and did its job well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc4c364a0c3193d3d89715b6c8a81b08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["DejaSenti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
