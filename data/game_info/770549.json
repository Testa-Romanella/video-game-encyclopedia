The box forces you to keep on moving to the right and once you seem like your going to go free, it loops you back to the start.\u00a0 Avoid spikes that appear and break them with your spike jump. Pressing space or clicking the screen makes the protagonist jump and pressing it again midair will allow you to do a spike jump. The protagonist also has another trick up his sleeve. When you spin through the spikes three times, you gain the ability to\u00a0loop back to the start if you long press space or click the screen long enough.\u00a0Maybe if you then stay in the box's game very long will you escape from this nightmare. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Miyaki (Programmer and Artist)</p>\n<p>Takago (Cover Artist and Music Composer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T13:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f729de6491aaa547d263b978d71a9cbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
