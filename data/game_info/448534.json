Our team finally disbanded four days before the deadline of the Jam.<br/><br/>Taking some of my demo assets, I threw together this game over a matter of four days. Yes, it is an RPGMaker game and no, it is not what I was hoping to make, but I am still pretty proud of it and happy with the amount I have learned over the past month. I hope you all enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1e929795e5adfcd10cda317bafb6598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkMirror"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
