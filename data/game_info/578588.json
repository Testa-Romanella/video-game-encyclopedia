The species yearns for\u00a0 anything that could provide them with the human feel. After a team of researchers found DNA from various flowers on a strange planet, one of their entities is sent to collect the remnants. The scientists hopes to gain deeper insights into the human soul knowing about the importance of flowers in human poems, music or mysticism. But on the planet is much more than the expected DNA and the entitiy starts to question the human body and its relation to nature...<br/></em></p>\n<p>The Jam's topic and the given examples of older Jams also inspired me to think about the way i apporach games general. During the developmet of the game i created a DevLog capturing thoughts and reflections on the development process in general, violence in games and the capitalistic influences on the industry. Since <strong>of</strong> <strong>Flowers and Bodies </strong>is my first game i ran into crazy technical issues towards the end of the Jam and my focuss had to be on coding. But as soon as i have time to gather my notes i will integrate the Log into the game.</p>\n<p>The game will stay in development, i wasnt really able to integrate the story as much as i wanted, but  i will update new versions further on. It is definitely playable, probably full of bugs, but that's the beatuy of it. Good Night and Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T05:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f936cf89d9fe50f96c153d5564f09229.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["silverrhills"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
