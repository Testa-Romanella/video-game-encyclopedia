There is no other goal but to find pleasant arrangements and enjoying the melody.</p>\n<p>The composition is a tribute to the musician <em>Jean-Jacques Perrey</em>. Some sounds are samples from his album\u00a0<em>The Amazing New Electronic Pop Sound of Jean-Jacques Perrey. </em>(But if you're curious about the artist, I highly recommend\u00a0<em>Moog Mig Mag Moog</em>).</p>\n<p>This game was made over a week-end as an entry for the Music Game Jam 2017. Source code is available\u00a0on github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d8632643ca976b210503a4bfe3ea54be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itooh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
