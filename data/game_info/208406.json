The concept is pretty simple - you control a spaceship and have to survive 21 waves of enemy and environmental attacks. The controls are intuitive - 'A' or 'D' make the ship go left or right, the 'spacebar' fires a laser and holding the 'left shift' key makes the ship twice as fast. Give it a try, it's fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a95d074d6b3158208ad1ca48f365cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZakAtk Gamez"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
