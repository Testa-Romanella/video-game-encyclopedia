I dedicated 3 weeks on modding this, but okay then.\u00a0 Anyways, a girl by the name of Ann visits her school campus to try and get her usb drive she left in her classroom. All of a sudden, it becomes spooky and very much haunted (oh noes). So now she has to go through the labyrinth filled with haunted beings. Will she escape? Why is this called a Variety Mod? I dunno. Find out when you play this mod thing game, I guess. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you want to support the original game, click here:\u00a0Ann by RongRong (itch.io)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b769933540d29fc150242d97ad3b15a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ATVariety17569"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
