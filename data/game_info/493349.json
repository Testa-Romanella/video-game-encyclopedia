It's a short game but I hope it's fun for at least a minute or two. I would eventually like to make a project designed for speed running, so let me know what you think of the basic teleport mechanic.</p>\n<p>You have to collect the spinning blue cubes before your timer runs out at the top. You can double jump and set teleport points to return to. You will see a prompt that tells you when you set a point and when you actually used teleport. The process will return you to a saved position and rotation, so use it to create a checkpoint before a risky jump or to save time by returning to a more central location.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Z - Jump</p>\n<p>X - Set/use teleport point</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Turn/Move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:17:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a833bfe8e15c9f9108b0b2e306a5f71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheBuffED"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
