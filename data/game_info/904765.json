{"id": 904765, "slug": "dreamwalker-itch-jayzonbh", "name": "Dreamwalker (itch) (JayzonBH)", "name_original": "Dreamwalker (itch) (JayzonBH)", "description": "<p>A visual novel about a man who discovers the existence of another dimension hidden in dreams.</p>\n<p>Explore and learn the rules of\u00a0a\u00a0new reality, meet fellow dreamwalkers and solve the mystery of a disaster in the past, while simultaneously avoiding getting fired from your day job as a software designer. Make decisions, build relationships and strive to reach the best ending!</p>\r\nEARLY ACCESS\r\n<p><strong>Dreamwalker is still very much work in progress! The story is not finished, there are some missing and placeholder graphics and it is possible future versions will break existing save games.</strong> However, in this state the game is also completely free! In the future, the game might get a (small) price tag, especially if I decide to go full voice acting.</p>\n<p>I'm aiming for a single playthrough length of a few hours. The game has choices, branching paths, and a relationship system where your decisions affect what people think of you, and some options might be unavailable if a person doesn't like you enough.</p>\n<p>There is also optional romance (if the person in question likes you enough), but at least for now, these aspects of the game are very light - so light that I'm not going to add the romance-tag even though that could bring me lots a potential players.</p>\n<p>Currently (1.1.2023) the game's script has 30k words, all paths combined.</p>\r\nCONTENT WARNINGS\r\n<p>The game <strong>does not</strong> contain\u00a0nudity or sexual content.</p>\n<p>The game <strong>does </strong>contain bad language.</p>\n<p>Your playthrough\u00a0<strong>might contain</strong> scenes with alcohol-use and abuse of medication.</p>\n<p>Depending on your choices, your playthrough <strong>might also contain</strong> descriptions of violence, self-harm, and/or suicide. These scenes are quite rare though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T07:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f620e44d81d78c7be318f7df6dc712db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JayzonBH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
