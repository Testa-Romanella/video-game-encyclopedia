A man of average intellect. A man with little to no developer ambitions. No previous experience. A man with\u00a0 no concept or vision. He had never made a drawing -\u00a0 \"you even write like a drunk 4 year old\", they said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it was this very man who wondered what the f*\u00a0 game engines do ...so he did what every man (or woman) would do: he set himself a goal he was reasonably confident he would abandon long before reaching it.\u00a0He decided to create a game.</p>\n<p>No obstacle was too big to overcome (his daughter was only 76cm at the time so he was able to\u00a0step over her to\u00a0 reach his advanced workstation). He spent every waking minute (mostly 1 hour after my daughter's bed time and I wouldn't call that awake anymore) working on this project until Samurai S\u00f6ren was finally the success it is today. Admired by many. Feature rich. Yet simple.</p>\n\n<p><em>This game is in Very Late Early Access i.e. no new features will be released but the developer may consider addressing critical bugs as the game has not been tested.
