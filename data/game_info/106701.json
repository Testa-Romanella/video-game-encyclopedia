I was commuting accross London on the Overground every day, from Stratford to Gunnesbury - it would take me 2 hours to get to work. The routine started to take it's toll on my mental health but my sketchbook flourished with drawings of all the passengers that travelled with me. Now, as I look back through the pages of my notebook, I've come to appreciate at just how beautiful and diverse London is as witnessed on the Overground.\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is an autobiographical flatgame of how I remember the commute on the London Overground. All commuters are real people that have travelled with me and I happened to sketch them with a pen in my notebook. Make sure to turn on the volume to listen to Annabelle Godbold's wonderful music!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOverground on PC Gamer: http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week/2/<br/>\r\n\tOverground on Warpdoor and GameJam Curator.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56babaa7a7d4a8d856717d9231aaf976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rosa Carbo-Mascarell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
