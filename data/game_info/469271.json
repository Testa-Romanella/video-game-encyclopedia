As the title character Crash (a bandicoot is a ratlike Australian marsupial), you must clear 30 greatly varying levels. From the jungle to the ancient ruins to Cortex's mechanized lair, Crash's gameplay is familiar territory. Other than a one-level ride on the back of a boar, the action's all jumping and spinning attacks.</p>\n<p>The levels get continually tougher, but numerous free lives are found in plain sight of your path and are also earned in bonus rounds. In order to uncover all of the game, players will need to complete the levels without dying and by smashing all the crates. The game subsequently rewards you with colored gems that act as stairways to hidden areas found in the previous levels.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly Crash will have mass appeal, but the game isn't perfect. Trying to judge distances from the mostly static view behind Crash is one of the game's main flaws. Crash also lacks some of the diversity and innovative next-gen qualities found in Sega's Nights and Nintendo's Mario 64. This is most evident with Crash's boss characters whose patterns are easy to recognize.</p>\n<p>Overall, Crash's lighthearted, wacky tone and brilliant eye-candy will have players bounding over obstacles and crushing crates for days on end. PlayStation platform fans should make like a bandit for this Bandicoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tips</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>To defeat Ripper Roo, first dodge him by moving between the front three cubes. When he approaches from the back, activate the nearby TNT and move away.</li><li>Don't use spin attacks against Papu Papu. Jump on his head after he swings and misses you with his club.</li><li>Smashing all the boxes without dying will give you a \"perfect\" screen and a gem.</li><li>When outrunning the boulders, try to run in as straight a line as possible. Follow trails of fruit as they guide you around obstacles.</li><li>When spin-busting crates on small platforms, be sure you're standing still before hitting the spin attack button, or you may spin right off.</li><li>In the Cortex Power level, jump to the right and bounce off the wall to avoid the spiked robots.</li></ul>\r\nGraphics\r\n<p>Lush, clean, colorful textures provide the most stunning scenery in a 32-bit game to date. Some polygonal enemies are tame-looking, but effects like steam and Ore set new visual standards. Crash's death animations lend a Warner Brothers flair.</p>\r\nSound\r\n<p>Excellent sound effects include the splash of Crash falling in the water and the shriek and flutter of bats. The characters have little to say, however, and the subtle, unintru-sive music may come off as silly to some.</p>\r\nControl\r\n<p>With only a spin attack and a jump, Crash's controls are simple. The tight directional-pad control borders on hyper-sensitive-which is necessary to navigate the more difficult 3D environments.</p>\r\nFun Factor\r\n<p>Although the gameplay Isnt revolutionary, the cool look of each new level drives you onward. This pretty platform game proves the PlayStation can deliver a smooth, enjoyable 3D adventure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:29:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfacbac05a4ad9c49dbdaa5dd12f606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Art"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
