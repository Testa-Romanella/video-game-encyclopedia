It is time to prove your brick breaker skills!<br />\nAncient Bricks is a stunning brick breaker game.  You have to journey through an ancient temple, collecting as many treasures as you can.  You can either explore the temple&#39;s chambers through 180 beautifully handcrafted levels or venture below into the mine where the deeper you get the more precious treasures you will find!<br />\n<strong><em> Game Modes </em></strong><br />\nExploration: you can discover 6 different labyrinths containing 180 unique chambers.  You must break all bricks in a chamber to complete the level.  Use the paddle to collect the falling treasurers and power-ups.  Be careful, though, as not all power-ups are handy!<br />\nMine: lots of gold, crystals and ancient treasure are buried deep under the temple.   You can use a huge mining machine to break even the strongest bricks but some special powerful balls can also be very useful for this work.   How far can you get?<br />\n<strong><em> Main Features </em></strong><br />\n\u2013 180 handcrafted levels in Exploration Mode<br />\n\u2013 endless destruction in Mining Mode<br />\n\u2013 7 unlockable ball types<br />\n\u2013 more than 30 unlockable upgrades<br />\n\u2013 real-time physics<br />\n\u2013 lots of power-ups, power-downs and collectable items<br />\n\u2013 daily, weekly missions and ad hoc challenges<br />\n\u2013 single touch and tilt controls<br />\n\u2013 fast-paced addictive gameplay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-02T18:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f6/1f6865f294049d861da0876fd800018d.jpeg", "website": "http://www.zippymob.com/ancient-bricks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Zippy Mobile"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Zippy Mobile Beteti Tarsasag"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
