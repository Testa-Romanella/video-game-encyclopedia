Inspired by traumatic childhood experiences with claw crane game machines, the player has not only limited time to move across mega-sized pizzas, but also just one shot to beam up the pineapple.</p>\n<p>But beware! With each level, the collected pineapples take over your UFO bit by bit as the controls get harder and harder with each level. Can you make it to the last level with that superawesome [SECRET]? <br/></p>\n<p>The game is playable with keyboard and controller:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD / Right Joystick: Move</li><li>SPACE / A (Bottom Face Button): Use Beam</li></ul>\n<p>Use with a gamepad controller is recommended!<br/></p><p>Pls note: pineapple on pizza is actually not as bad as social media platforms make you think it is!</p>\n<p>This prototype is a submission for the Search For A Star 2023 challenge by Grads in Games. Please see the documentation attached for more details.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b00c5d92e2f70cc0b2f8b9a79dce18a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GemoneOo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
