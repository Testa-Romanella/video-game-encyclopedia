R\u00a0also works to restart back to the main menu.</p>\n<p><strong>For starting out, I strongly recommend these settings:</strong></p>\n<br/>\r\nDifficulty\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen picking a song, the number shown represents an approximate difficulty rating. Use this to pick a song closer to your own level.\r\n</p>\r\nChart modes\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are two different chart modes which change how the charts are generated:<br/>\n<strong>4-Key:</strong> Meant for playing with four fingers in a split manner, using two finger from each hand. For this mode I recommend using the <strong>[2][1][Down][Right]</strong> layout (such that it maps to Z, X, Down, Right on keyboard.)<br/>\n<strong>Index:</strong> Meant for playing using only your two index fingers on the directional buttons. For this mode I recommend using the <strong>[Left][Down][Up][Right]</strong> layout.<br/>\n</p>\r\nAudio offset\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you get a lot of EARLY or LATE when you feel that you are timing correctly, nudge the Audio Offset setting a couple of steps.\r\n\tNote that this setting counts in frames, so you don't need to change it by a lot. <strong>-2</strong> works well for me.\r\n</p>\r\nEnjoying the game?\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeave a comment, or send a screenshot of a score! It makes me happy to hear people enjoy my games.\r\n</p>\r\nTechnical details\r\n<p>\r\n\twasm4nia itself was written in C. For the (few) sprites, I used aseprite. All of the music was written in FL Studio, exported to MIDI, and then converted, compressed, and bundled into the game. The charts are algorithmically generated from the note data using various weightings for things like following melody, jacks, and finger switches when playing index. Despite its flaws, I'm pretty happy with how it all turned out.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f2df76f833e24eea1e54b041956de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JerwuQu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
