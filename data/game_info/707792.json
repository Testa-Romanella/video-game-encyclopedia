The heart and soul poured into this game really pays off. I've been on itch.io for the longest time, and in all my years, I've never seen a game that perfectly encapsulates such a human experience. I'd have to say, this game describes a very depressive episode, as many people in one have a huge loss of control with their sleep schedule, due to insomnia, overworking, etc. I've got to say, this game is perfect in every way. Even though being the first game I've made, it emits all of my talents.</p>\n<p>Ok, it's shit.</p>\n<p>Will add a trailer and photos soon, and I have an update planned.</p>\n<p>I'm finally done with this stupid game, now I can live my life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:42:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1c36257c965fc4a87dd04c53aa65062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAwesomeGM"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
