The purpose of it is to collect 12 diamonds. Press the space bar to move your character to where your mouse is. For every second you stay in the red zone, Your danger level goes up. If it reaches 5, you lose. It will go away after a few seconds. Finally, you have the 'F' key, which freezes the line for 1.5 seconds and makes it safe to go inside of. You can only use it once.</p><p>Game Link:\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/521888848/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T15:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa2141afb8ee92f90bbeba70aeaa09e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GalacticPotato22"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
