{"id": 54500, "slug": "ready-2-rumble-boxing", "name": "Ready 2 Rumble Boxing", "name_original": "Ready 2 Rumble Boxing", "description": "<p>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is a boxing video game developed by Midway and published in 1999 for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64. The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.</p>\n<p>Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series, it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over one's character in the ring. Also unlike Punch-Out!!, players can choose whichever boxer they want from a rather large selection of characters.</p>\n<p>Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one or two letters at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows; most such actions will yield one letter, though some particularly strong punches may yield more. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special combo called \"Rumble Flurry\", activated by pressing a button combination. Each character's \"flurry\" is unique to them, and consists of a series of punches which does a large amount of damage if landed successfully.</p>\n<p>One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game.</p>\n<p>The Game Boy Color version was one of the few games for the system to feature built-in rumble.</p>\n<p>The Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 versions each have an exclusive boxer: these are, respectively, Jimmy Blood, Gino Stiletto, and J.R. Flurry.</p>\n<p>Ring announcer Michael Buffer appears in the game as himself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-02T18:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/529/5292fb5f3c458a027a1bb91540d22312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 9, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "PlayStation", "Nintendo 64", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Midway Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Midway Games", "Midway"], "esrb_rating": null}
