Assemble your bots from the most unlikely household parts and create a party that complements each other&#39;s skills to become the ultimate gear crunching machine.<br />\nMake Your Own Frankie<br />\nBuild your Frankie by choosing a body, a head, two weapons and an engine from a variety of options. Use chainsaws, disco balls, tennis ball launchers and even a time-bending clock to get the look and playstyle that works for you. Then make it yours by unlocking skins, avatars and emotes.<br />\nChallenging Combat<br />\nFrankie is kinda cute but his enemies don&#39;t cut him any slack for looks! You&#39;ll need to be a total badass, master the skills and their combos and learn how to fight off Senior Cleaners, Foremen and Boilees to even reach the likes of Junkyard Joe or the other nefarious bosses.<br />\nPlay Online, Local Co-Op or Solo<br />\nYou can play with your friends in a local party or join others online in any mix you prefer. Or go all Rambo on those evil aliens and get revenge on your own!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-29T14:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/1789b0577a2b57084949ebc5b56ebf03.jpg", "website": "http://www.rikodu.com/second-hand-frankies-revenge/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rikodu"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rikodu"], "esrb_rating": null}
