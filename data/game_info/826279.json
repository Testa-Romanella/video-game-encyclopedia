It tells the story of a nameless girl trying to find her way home; while finding her way\u00a0through the foggy woods, she comes across wooden signs that tells the story of another woman who lost\u00a0her face, legs and arms. In exchange for finding her body parts, the woman tells the \"traveller\" that her signs will lead her\u00a0to an exit. With little choice, the girl follows the path; unaware of the journey she will soon partake in.</p>\n<p>DYSMORPHIA is a game less focused on complex mechanical design and more on atmosphere and story.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/660508d87c29611abfcf71c70cb79f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stargirlfiles"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
