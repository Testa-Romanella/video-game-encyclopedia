I spent some time and made it into something more playable.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe objective is to navigate the maze to gather keys and unlock your way out.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>VERSION 1.0.2:  </strong>Update to (hopefully) fix a performance issue causing severe slow-down in some cases.</p>\n<p><strong>VERSION 1.0.1:</strong> There are currently 5 levels with increasing difficulty. There are also a lot more features and the levels are optimized considerably from the first release. Some new features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Options in the pause menu</li><li>GUI indicates when a key has been used</li><li>Level select (levels unlock as you go)</li><li>You can reset your progress if you want to start over</li><li>Several bug fixes</li><li>... more</li></ul>\n<p>\r\n\tIf there is enough interest in this game, I will update it with more levels and features. Donations will ensure these updates.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLeave a comment and let me know what you think.\r\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>\n<strong>KEYBOARD:</strong><br/>\r\n\t Arrow keys :: Move<br/>\r\n\t Enter :: Select<br/>\r\n\t Backspace :: Back<br/>\r\n\t Escape :: Pause/Back\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GAMEPAD:</strong><br/>\r\n\t D-Pad / Left Stick:: Move<br/>\r\n\t A :: Select<br/>\r\n\t B :: Back<br/>\r\n\t Start :: Pause\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a7a67df3f4bfe617ad3e147000736e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digitalhead Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
