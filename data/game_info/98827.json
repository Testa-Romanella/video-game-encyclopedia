After the War, He will find the salvation through his research.</p>\n<p>Project Salvation, the old name Project S features point-and-click experience and some puzzle. Therefore, the game is created by historical background, so you will find many histories.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the game sets after The War Ends Sky. It means you will find something related to it throughout playing the game.</p>\n<p>Total four chapters with multiple routes and endings.</p>\n<p>Further notes: The game is cancelled in order to focus on The War Ends Sky. However, after TWES is finished, I will revive this project. Because it is a direct sequel. The design has been settled already, what I need is something more complicated plan and budget. You can still play the prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f9c5f7ddffe51cf676fbe52b6f3670e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tristram Arts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
