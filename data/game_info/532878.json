There are things he can do, and things he has trouble doing - whether he manages them or not is up to you. Match and beat cards in mini- and main Tasks to finish your chores, leave the house, buy groceries - even run into people you wish you hadn't.</p>\n<p>This chunk of 10-15min playtime was\u00a0 put together to be critiqued and messed with to make the actual foundation good before I continue with the rest of the project. I'd love to hear about any bugs or issues, but especially feedback on whether or not the gameplay itself is fun/boring/rewarding/annoying/bad since that's obviously more important to get right than what comes next.<br/></p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>speeding through dialogue may make it behave weirdly</li><li>gui plays cursor and confirmation sounds simultaneously</li><li>sizing and placement of cards is a bit off due to a last-minute sprite edit</li><li>the random number choices for some tasks should probably be less random</li><li>foostep sounds are a bit too prevalent</li><li>confirmation/win sound plays again after main task completes</li><li>interactor sprites don't always behave normally</li><li>sub-goals aren't notified upon completion</li></ul>\n<p>Unfortunately in the process of developing even the demo, I've encountered more than enough resistance from the very force the game is commenting on.<br/>Full disclosure, it's intentionally impossible to achieve 100% completion. Life's hard for a \"deadbeat\".</p><p>If there are any particularly game-breaking bugs, I apologise profusely - I'm uploading this at 2:30am.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/fea38dec7fb1383e0ab100223cfec329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sheen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
