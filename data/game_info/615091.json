{"id": 615091, "slug": "janosik-2", "name": "Janosik 2", "name_original": "Janosik 2", "description": "Janosik 2 is a continuation of the story put in motion by the first game. The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies \u2013 both mythical and historical. This time around, it\u2019s not the band of brothers that\u2019s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br/>\nSTORY\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nA bigger adventure\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nThese Walls Were Meant to Be Broken\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nDie, Die and Repea... Die Again\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br/>\nIs This A Joke to You?\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br/>\nScenes That Cut\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br/>\nGet Collecting\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T04:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25a/25aac5848f5dae664c3400838341b2d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Onix Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Retrovibe"], "esrb_rating": null}
