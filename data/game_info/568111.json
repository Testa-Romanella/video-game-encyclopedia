However, everytime it hits you, you will be prompted with three choices: adding another ball, increasing the speed of the ball(s), or placing a wall block randomly in the arena. These upgrades allow you to score higher, but be careful, you have a limited amount of lives and the balls can shoot you!</p>\n<p>Time limit of 1 minute per match.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p><p>Update: Mac now supported and fixed bug where UI was not on screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c8cfa693a39b8cbdf2d8e895efdbf83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["skiwee45"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
