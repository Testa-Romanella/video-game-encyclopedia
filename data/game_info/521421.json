This project is not affiliated in any way\u00a0with KONAMI, the current owners of Castlevania franchise.</p>\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is a competitive two-player game only. Currently, only the host can play as the vampire hunter, while the player who joins the match can only play as Dracula.\u00a0<br/>The goal for either player is to defeat their opponent. The vampire hunter gets 5 lives, while Dracula only gets 1. There's also a timer that shows the total match\u00a0time, which can be your tie-breaker if you swap roles between rounds.<br/></p>\n\r\nInternet\r\n<p>The game will attempt to open port 45387 (TCP/UDP) by using UPNP, which is available\u00a0on most modern home routers. If it succeeds, your public IP will be shown to you\u00a0so you can send it to the person you wish to play with (your IP is hidden by default,\u00a0so don't worry if you're streaming). If this fails, you can attempt to open the required\u00a0port manually by configuring your router.</p>\n<p>You can also play using VPN solutions like Hamachi by hosting on the local network\u00a0and searching for the match or joining via the Internet option which allows you to\u00a0type in the IP manually.</p>\r\nControls\r\nGeneral\r\n<ul><li><strong>Enter, Spacebar or Left-Click:</strong> Activate menu option.</li><li><strong>Alt+Enter:</strong> Toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode.</li></ul>\r\nPlaying as the\u00a0Vampire Hunter\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left/Right Arrows:</strong> Move left or right.</li><li><strong>Up/Down Arrows:</strong> Go up or down stairs when close to them.</li><li><strong>Z:</strong> Attack.</li><li><strong>X:</strong> Jump.</li><li><strong>C:</strong> Use current item.</li></ul>\n<p>Gamepad controls are also supported.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nPlaying as Dracula\r\n<p>Mouse cursor and left click or touch controls on the Android version.
