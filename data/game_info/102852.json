Waves of the local hostile race of Birdmen instantly come charging at you. Armed with your laser blaster and energy sword, the goal is to defend yourself and the wreckage of your ship at all costs.<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the project was built overnight during an impromptu hackathon. Initially, we built it to see what it's like to work with VR, but we ended up polishing it for two or so weeks and it turned into something we're quite proud of, our sort of neon-drenched love letter to retro first person shooters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e86888dcdaa967fa1ac73c6c33569578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevilCowStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
