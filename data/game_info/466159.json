Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that you cannot control the hero? Control the enemies to stop the player from winning each level. Unfortunately your minions are pretty dumb, and you have no control over how they move. Set a location for your minions to pathfind to and hope to stop the player and become the ultimate Anti-Hero!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5d/a5d2ca8f90eae1f55fafdeffcc37f54c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vortex Bros."], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
