My goal was to create a game where this is used to both defeat your enemies and defend your self. I decided to use colours in order to represent different elements and have replace the rock, paper and scissors.</p>\n\n<p>Objective</p>\n<p>While you try to survive the onslaught of enemy fire, you must switch between the different colours in order to take them out. The catch is that the enemies are doing the same thing as you. Survive as long as you can while taking out as many enemies as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Please enjoy and feel free to comment and provide feedback! I always enjoy reading reviews as I believe feedback will help me continue to improve my game design.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Mark</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d1bbd6c323697db103003d50c19ef5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mooseman272"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
