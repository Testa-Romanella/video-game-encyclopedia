Lost and forgotten, a new kingdom was built upon the empty hills that mark its grave -- but its ruins are still populated by the vengeful, twisted spirits of its once-proud people, and whosoever falls into these depths is most certainly doomed to suffer a torturous demise at their hands.<br />\nBounty hunter Ares, however, is not quite so willing to accept this fate. In this reimagining of a golden-era classic, Ares must work his way up to freedom through over 40 floors of unimaginable danger while his archrival, Dela -- a powerful sorceress who fell into the ruins with him -- is hot on his tail.<br />\nSolve brain-busting puzzles, battle unique enemies and forge ever onward in this contemporary dungeon-crawling action RPG from the makers of Ys and The Legend of Heroes!<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
