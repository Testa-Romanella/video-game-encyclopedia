Who\u00a0poured down from the northland, using the Kapathi Pass\u00a0through the Cloud Spires. The Kapathi fell, and the demons\u00a0continues on, destroying the Domra capital in the southern edges\u00a0of the Lakelands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>15 years ago the demons left and returned north. But they left\u00a0behind the goblinkin. Without the overseers this horde fell to in\u00a0</p>\n<p>fighting. This was the opportunity for freedom. Those who had been under oppressive occupation for generations broke free and\u00a0began to fight back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now there is an unsettled and unstable push for\u00a0reestablishing civilization in the Kapathi. But enemies and\u00a0dangers abound. The threat of the demons return, the goblinkin\u00a0war parties, the barbarians of the Cloud Spires have coalesced\u00a0behind a new leader and eye the Kapathi as a target. The\u00a0Wisdom, the nature spirit of the Great Grey Swamp wishes to build back and lash out against any encroaching civilization, the cultists who serve and worship the demons seek to maintain\u00a0some hold on power, and lastly, the fools from afar who seek to\u00a0reclaim and rebuild the Domra Empire from the ashes and ruin it is today. How will the Kapathians keep their world safe,free and\u00a0on track toward surviving and thriving. They have rallied behind\u00a0</p>\n<p>a few leaders who hold central lands in the stone downs and on\u00a0the slopes of the great west valley. They seek to expand their\u00a0</p>\n<p>control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5667f6fc4b37bdb8b7a7fa11dd6d6349.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MULE CITY PRESS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
