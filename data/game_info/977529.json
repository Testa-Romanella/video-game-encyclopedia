Rogho Corporation is one of the Evil organizations which toppled the previous Government of Rogholand. They took full control over the territory of Rogholand and its people. <br/><br/>Since the Rogho Corporation took over the territory there have been reports of border clashes frequently. After a few months of coming to power, they went a bit too far by declaring a war against Sunshineland. So, the Sunshineland warriors, a group of five formidable female super soldiers, have been commanded by the leader of Sunshineland Army to fight against the intruders and to protect the territory at any cost. Rogho Corporation deployed the formidable human as well as robot warriors around the border areas. Moreover, the enemies took a few civilians as hostages. They started launching multiple missiles towards the Sunshineland territory which had reportedly destroyed some of the agricultural fields, a few buildings, and a few sunflower gardens.
