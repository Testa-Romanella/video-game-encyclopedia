She really looks up to Luna.</p>\n<p>Luna - A hacker who is skilled and has even modded her character's in-game skills.</p>\n<p>Black Wolf - The leader of the Black Legion Guild and an elite hacker.

Known to be silent but when he speaks others listen.</p>\n<p>Black Rose - A girl who has not been in the guild for very long. She believes that one day she will be the second in command to Wolf. She tries her best to be serious and cool around the other members. However, around Wolf and Fox, she instantly turns into a submissive school girl.</p>\n<p>Black Rayven - A kind girl that is a bit dark with her humor at times. She is a hacker but compared to Wolf she is a noob.</p>\n<p>Black Angel - The oddest girl in possibly the whole universe. It is not clear why she is the way she is but what is known is that like her twin sister she is a hacker whose skills could use a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Black Dragon - Once known as the famous Immortal Dragon in Twilight Tower.
