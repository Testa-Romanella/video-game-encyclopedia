The more gold and gems you feed him, the longer you\u2019ll be able to stay airborne the next day. Collect treasure from the sky with each flight, and make it to higher altitudes with each attempt.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>At home:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Click on an object or button to interact with it.</li></ul>\n<p>In flight:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Control the dragon with the cursor.\u00a0</li><li>Increase speed with LMB or Left Shift.\u00a0</li><li>Increase lift with RMB or Left Alt.</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing our gut-wrenchingly cute jam submission. There\u2019s lots we would\u2019ve liked to add (more dragon interactions, extra flight mechanics, any audio whatsover xD) but such is the way of Ludum Dare! At any rate, we hope the cute baby dragon brings a smile to your face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:40:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce586db8f6182e48c1f25d93a49654a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dmtroy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
