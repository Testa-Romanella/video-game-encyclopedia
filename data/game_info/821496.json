Some want bigger numbers, others smaller. The closer you can get it, the better!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the buttons at the top of the screen to spawn dice. There are 4 types. A\u00a04-die, 6-die, 8-die and 20-die. Select a die by hovering your mouse over it and holding the left mouse button. While holding the die, you can shake it to obtain a value by pressing or holding\u00a0the right mouse button or space bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Match the dice to the values in the circles. A circle with a <strong>+</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong>\u00a0needs a value greater or equal to what is\u00a0shown. A circle with a\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong>or <strong>&lt;\u00a0</strong>needs a value smaller or equal to what is shown. A circle with only a number needs a value that matches it exactly.</p>\n<p>Clear Circles to earn points. The closer you can get the value, the more points you'll earn!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0a7a57c826a16bc77ec9ebb266f819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["mithrone"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
