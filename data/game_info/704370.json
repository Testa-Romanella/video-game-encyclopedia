Because of that there are a few things missing, like a screen if you win a level or the secondary attack for the player and sometimes the player or the monster can get stuck in the level. \r\n<br/>\r\nIf I have the time I'll complete the game and update it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nUntil now there is no tutorial so here is a short explanation:<br/>\r\nIn the game you need to push the rubbish into the Rubbishdisposal on the left side of the level. And you need to fight the monster made of rubbish and clear the rubbish left behind from it to win the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nControls:\r\n<br/>\r\nPress Spacebar to Move into the direction your mouse is pointing.\r\n<br/>\r\nPress Left Mouse Button for Bubble Attack.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75a/75abe5cc6e2d03ebc58fb207a959d973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DaveUnbelievable"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
