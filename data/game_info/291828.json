{"id": 291828, "slug": "battlecosm-cherokee-blade", "name": "Battlecosm - Cherokee Blade", "name_original": "Battlecosm - Cherokee Blade", "description": "<p>A small prototype for an arcade style, combat helicopter sim, inspired by classics from the 90's like Gunblade NY and Forsaken. The demo offers 360 degree gameplay and somewhat capable enemies, ranging from jets, helicopters, mechs and soldiers. Unfortunately this demo only has\u00a0one small level, but there are objectives and scripted encounters. It features SEGA Mega Drive style tracks to liven up the action.</p>\n<p>This demo was made during\u00a0two weeks on and off. I work as a\u00a0software developer by trade, but I'm not a professional game developer whatsoever. This was made as a hobby, but I felt that maybe someone out there besides me might like something like this, so this project was uploaded to get feedback on whether I should continue to develop it further.\u00a0Please give any thoughts in the comments and enjoy the little prototype!</p>\n<p>W A S D - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look<br/></p>\n<p>Space &amp; Ctrl - Up/Down hover</p>\n<p>E &amp; Q - Tilt Left and Right</p>\n<p>Mouse LMB - Machine Guns\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse RMB - Rockets</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596f4e5dd18fabcf61d0abb732008d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MercySoft"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
