{"id": 960131, "slug": "great-again", "name": "Great Again", "name_original": "Great Again", "description": "A Great Again game would be a thrilling and intense experience for players. The game would likely be set in a dark and foreboding world, where zombies roam freely and humans are constantly on the run. Players would take on the role of a survivor who has managed to evade the zombies and stay alive in this dangerous world.<br/><br/>The game mechanics would likely involve a mix of stealth, combat, and resource management. Players would need to carefully navigate through the world, avoiding zombie patrols and scavenging for supplies to stay alive. Combat would be a last resort, as zombies would be powerful and dangerous opponents who could easily overpower the player if they were caught off guard.<br/><br/>Another potential feature could be the ability to upgrade and customize the player character. As players progress through the game, they could earn experience points and acquire new skills and abilities, such as improved stealth or better combat techniques. They could also scavenge for resources to upgrade their weapons and equipment, making them better prepared to take on the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game could also feature a strong narrative component, with a compelling story that drives the player's actions and decisions. The story could involve uncovering the origins of the zombie outbreak and discovering a way to stop it, or it could be a more personal story of survival and redemption.<br/><br/>Overall, a Great Again game would be a thrilling and immersive experience for players who enjoy survival and horror games. The combination of combat, and resource management, along with a compelling story and the ability to customize the player character, would make for a highly engaging and memorable game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T02:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/98825f7f10c0a469cc7b8e5ed1e171c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grey Sekiya"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grey Sekiya"], "esrb_rating": null}
