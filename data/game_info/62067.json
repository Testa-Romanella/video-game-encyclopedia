The setting is an alternate history WW2 where the warmongering \u201cEmpire\u201d is terrorizing its friendly neighbors. The young men and women brainwashed by the Empire see the war of aggression as justified.<br/><br/><br/>You take the role of a young, naive, brainwashed soldier, Bastian. Wounded in the battle, Bastian gets a second chance to serve the Empire in a factory building tanks. Some of the people in the factory are linked to Bastian's past and some to his future. They say love is blind, but in this case love and where it leads our young protagonist can completely change his future and the course of the war. A chain of events and a cry from his past make Bastian question his loyalty and his side in the war.<br/><br/><br/>The gameplay is visual novel style, so you read the story and make choices, which affect the game.
