Unfortunately, Ii didn't have nearly enough time to create a working and skilled AI.</p>\n<p>This game turned into a survival board game where each turn a number of missiles rain down on the board. You try to connect blocks together to help you survive as more and more of the board is destroyed.</p>\n<p>I was unable to include any sound design for the game jam but I will definitely add some after rating is over and I will\u00a0try to improve\u00a0\u00a0other aspects of the game such as a way to end games and restart which I'm aware isn't possible for the current build. There are also a few bugs I've noticed I need to work out.</p>\n<p>That being said I'm still happy I participated in the jam although it isn't exactly how I wanted it to turn out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d70e8e5366c774c73f88d4fe5779aa35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BurnsBoy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
