As the undead captain of a mysterious vessel sent from the afterlife into a somber world ruled by an ultra-powerful ocean tyrant, you are tasked with laying waste to evil seafaring forces, vanquishing powerful champion vessels, demolishing naval forts, and displacing The Patriarch from his position of power. Use special cannon shots, part-stealing powers, and increasingly powerful classes of naval vessel to give yourself the fighting edge and free the Maiden's Land!<h3>Arm Yourself and Your Crew</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Unique Special Shots:</strong> By defeating the Patriarch's champion vessels, you can steal their special arms for yourself. Employ these special cannon shots between separate cannon flanks on your boat to build creative offensive and defensive combinations and give yourself an advantage.<br/></li><li><strong>Cannibalize Opposing Vessels:</strong> Your vessel is equipped with the impressive magical ability to steal boards from enemy boats as you sink them. This heals damage to your hull in the moment, allowing you to build vicious momentum in outnumbered fights. It also awards you salvage upgrade points, which you can put into upgrading your vessel's attributes to make it stronger defensively and offensively.<br/></li><li><strong>Build up to Bigger Boats:</strong> As you explore the world, you'll come across formidable naval installations built into the land and sea. Demolishing these forts will afford you access to larger classes of boat, with more guns and greater durability at the cost of inferior maneuverability.
