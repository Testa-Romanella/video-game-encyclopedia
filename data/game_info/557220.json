Take a stroll through this virtual park, spot some animals, feed the ducks and recover a lost item. The goal is to simply enjoy the sights and the peaceful soundscape without the stress of deadlines, quests, save-files and other burdens. This experience is slightly different each time you boot it up, so feel free to drop by whenever you need it. Just try to unwind, and if you succeed in doing so, please tell me how!<br/><br/>Supports mouse+keyboard and Xbox controller!<br/><br/>Here are some features I am hoping to implement if this experience is well recieved:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>More animals</li><li>Trash to clean up</li><li>Sitting by the campfires</li><li>Smoke and blossom particle effects</li><li>Other neat stuff</li></ul>\n<p>Here are some known issues I'm too lazy to fix right now:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Lighting a campfire sometimes takes two key presses</li><li>Animals get stuck in hills sometimes</li><li>Controllers don't currently work in the menu</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun!<br/><br/>P.S. If anyone is interested in a spooky spin-off with more narrative, please let me know as it fits almost too well, I feel! The same goes for a Linux or Mac build.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c23/c2362fec4653d5bf23025a25a3019fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wouter van Vugt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
