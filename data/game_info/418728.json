One bird you would control with your mouse, and the other bird would chase you. The enemy bird starts off being slow, but its speed raises every few seconds, making it harder and harder as you go on. Obviously, if the bird did manage to catch up to you, you would basically die, and text appearing on the screen would say \"your sh*t score was [your score]\" this sounds like a very simple game concept, which it is. However, Kai's Bird Game, by Kai: Unity edition expands on that concept, adding obstacles that you and the enemy bird could hit, and making it more of a fun and wacky experience!<br/></p>\r\nControls &amp; Game play\r\n<p>The controls are pretty simple, move your mouse to control where the bird goes. The enemy bird will start off slow, but its speed will increase more and more slowly. This is identical to the classic Kai's Bird Game, by Kai, but there's one more thing I added. Obstacles! Currently, their are only 2 obstacles in the game, Bombs, and Acid rain. For each wave, their is a chance of 2, 3, or 5 bombs dropping. They're pretty easy to avoid, and you can make the enemy bird touch them to lower its speed. However, if you touch a bomb, the enemy's speed will rise, so watch out for that! The second one is Acid rain, this one's a bit harder to avoid because they're moving obstacles. But similarly to bombs, you can make the enemy touch a rain droplet to lower the speed of it, or vise versa.</p>\r\nContact me!\r\n<p>I'm planning to bring updates to this game, whether it'd be to add more obstacles, and maybe even bring levels! If you have a suggestion, feedback, or a bug report, you can either write a comment on this page, or contact me on either of these platforms!</p>\n<ul><li>Email: An email address will probably be made soon which would specifically be for support and developer things!</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0@SRGTheGreat123</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33f3743ddc650ba0448e0ba33c0d0485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SRGNation"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
