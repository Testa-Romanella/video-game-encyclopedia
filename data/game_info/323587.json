The premise is to make your way to a new planet to colonize for the human race, but this requires fighting pirates and buying items from shops to make you more powerful. All the controls you will need to worry about is: RMB to move camera, esc opens pause menu and LMB is used for standard clicking and interacting with\u00a0stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T05:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c1320a7ccbe03bd0b434a75666d9e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melvin8303"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
