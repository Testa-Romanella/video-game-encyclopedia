You must not let your inner flame die and eventually, each step at a time, you'll reach your own personal emancipation.</p>\n<p>This game was developed for the gr8artgames jam realized in Brazil in 2017. The theme was \"emancipation\". We believe any sort of emancipation must first start inside yourself; only after you free yourself from the dark places that haunt your mind you can expand this freedom to the outside world.</p><p>-----</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:</p><ul><li>Use the Arrow Keys or AWSD to move</li><li>Use the Space Bar or E to light up your torch or the forest torches and bonfires</li><li>Always stay inside the safety of the firelights</li></ul><p>AND ALSO:<br/></p><ul><li>Use a headphone for the optimal experience</li><li>Make it to the final bonfire for a mind-blowing ending!</li></ul><p>-----<br/></p>\n<p>Developed by @mgaiastudio<br/></p>\n<p>Programming/Design - Felipe Cancian Bertozzo<br/>Art/Design - Bruno Toledo</p>\n<p>Music/SFX - damettostudios</p>\n<p>www.goethe.de/artgames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4fe29c03fd9ee0f25c21a894441c98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mgaiastudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
