As Chicken and Cat share the location and the player must flip between using them, I would say the two are rather joined together.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e08d2ff333bdedf0ae0986dee8f160f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bucket_o_Beckett"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
