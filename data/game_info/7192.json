It&amp;#39;s a solid platformer, but what shines here is the level design. Colorful, vibrant, really cool moving obstacles to avoid. Really the variety in obstacles here is the star.&amp;quot;<br/>- &amp;quot;Really awesome game.&amp;quot;<br/>- \u201cHighly recommended!\u201d<br/>- &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m only on the second level but Kelly has already impressed me. It&amp;#39;s challenging and inventive from the start, and offers some really cool vibrant levels to platform through. I definitely recommend giving Kelly a try&amp;quot;<br/>- &amp;quot;where the game shines is in its level design and gameplay&amp;quot;<br/>- &amp;quot;From hinged platforms to color-coded barriers to laser-wielding spiders and shuriken-flinging robot arms, the mechanics and dangers here are varied and often combined in inventive ways.&amp;quot;<br/>- \u201cif you like platforming games, or anything with a little puzzle challenge, get this.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b4014fbe8b831556bd130f9c224331.jpeg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa4CwTfhCaU", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ANIV"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Goran Ivanis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
