During the development of this game we have gotten our inspiration from various japanese RPG MAKER games of the same genre such as Ib and The Witch's House which have motivated us to create our own.</p>\n<p>\u203b The game isn't suited for people with a nervous disposition for things such as horror and graphical horror such as blood and brutal deaths. </p>\n<p>\u203b Please note that it relies on an exceptional amout of symbolism which may be hard to understand throughout the first playthrough, so multiple playthroughs may be advised.</p>\n<p>\u203b To get the best experience out of the game we recomment the player to use headphones and adjust the screen brightness accordingly.</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf83 Premiss \ud83c\udf83</p>\n<p>The events of Pocket Mirror take place in a mysterious world where the player has to guide the main character in her journey to find her true identity. It is filled with dramatic as well as funny moments throughout and there are several characters to get to know throughout the game! </p>\n<p>The storytelling relies on symbolism and hints scattered throughout the game. It's divided into 2 main sub-plots although there are quite a few more, less relevant, sub-plots to experience.</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf83 Features \ud83c\udf83</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Original artwork</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Original animation (movies)</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Original soundtrack</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Visual novel elements</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Extra content in-game (music room, image gallery, secret content)</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Hearing impaired mode</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1f Voice acting</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf83 Contact \ud83c\udf83</p>\n<p>Official Blog: astralshiftpro.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>Bug reports:\u00a0astralshiftpro@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Main contact: astralshiftpro@gmail.com</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf83 Troubleshooting \ud83c\udf83</p>\n<p>Please visit our FAQ if you have any more questions regarding the game or Astral Shift's policies. </p>\n<p>If you need more information you can always refer to our Terms and Conditions, read the READ ME.txt file included in the game folder, tweet us @AstralShiftDS or send us an e-mail at astralshift@gmail.com!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf83 Changelog ver. 1.3 \ud83c\udf83<br/></p>\n<p>- Replacement of various uncredited resources with original resources.<br/>- Bug fix.<br/>- Atribution of proper resource credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db397e86238a680061dea29bffe14be6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astral Shift"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
