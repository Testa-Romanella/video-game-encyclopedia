Faster - provide venous access, charge the defibrillator and chase!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nReanimation inc is a completely realistic simulation - real urgent conditions and diseases, real protocols of care used in an ambulance, realistic simulation of the body! Do you like realistic games about medicine and simulators, games you need to think about? You 'll be happy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features a real ECG monitor that shows ECG, HCC, pressure, Pleth, blood saturation with oxygen (oxygenation) SpO2<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow can I help a patient without real knowledge? In this medical simulator I carefully worked out the system of theory - it is submitted simplified, but explains almost all manipulations carried out by paramedics and ambulance doctors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat 's interesting about this medical resuscitation and ambulance simulator?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"An idea.<br/>\r\nI decided to create the most realistic ambulance simulator that can be available to explain to the player the body 's device, first aid algorithms and medical care. I know everything in the world can be explained!<br/>\r\nWho knows - perhaps thanks to Reanimation inc one of the players recognizes a stroke and will call an ambulance, saved life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDefibrillation.<br/>\r\nYes! You learn how a defibrillator actually works and use it a lot of times! Learn what is meant by \"cardiac arrest,\" learn to fibrillate ventricular, atrial, asystolia, heart attack on ECG.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Resuscitation.<br/>\r\nYou will have to carry out CPR (indirect heart massage, make IVL artificial lung ventilation, administer drugs, defibrillate), urgently take the patient by ambulance to the hospital.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Realism.<br/>\r\nI was advised by doctors, paramedics, ambulance workers. Medical students took part in the testing.<br/>\r\n22 diseases, 17 drugs, 8 actions, studies.<br/>\r\nReal medical care algorithms, real resuscitation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Huge number of medical improvements!<br/>\r\nImprovements to ambulances<br/>\r\nDefibrillator Enhancements<br/>\r\nOpening of new medical courses<br/>\r\nLung ventilation improvements<br/>\r\nImproving endurance with indirect heart massage<br/>\r\nBleeding stop improvements<br/>\r\nPurchase of medicines<br/>\r\nDrip Improvements<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- States<br/>\r\nWhat medical simulator can do without real diseases? There are 22 of them in the game! By the way, it 's not that easy to diagnose them.<br/>\r\nMyocardial infarction (you will have to determine it by ECG and distinguish it from angina)<br/>\r\nCardiac arrest<br/>\r\nTHELA, pulmonary swelling<br/>\r\nBleeding, including internal<br/>\r\nAnaphylactic shock<br/>\r\nStroke<br/>\r\nAnd many, many others!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Medicines<br/>\r\nDo you know why adrenaline is used? And what to use in case of stroke or exacerbation of COPD?<br/>\r\nIn the game a huge number of drugs for all cases of life!<br/>\r\nYou 'll have to learn a lot of the knowledge of an ambulance doctor to save a patient.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Gameplay<br/>\r\nWhat can Reanimation inc - a biomedical simulation strategy - offer?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow can I help a patient without real knowledge?
