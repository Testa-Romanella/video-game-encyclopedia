You find that not only in his cabin, but in Elliott himself.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p>Crocus Field is a short\u00a0romantic\u00a0slice-of-life Stardew\u00a0Valley visual novel fangame initiated during Winter VN Jam 2021.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is still in development, with about three routes of twelve mostly done.\u00a0The full game takes place in winter over a few days, with a run-in with each bachelor and bachelorette.\u00a0 There is an option to have a romantic or platonic encounter with them.</p>\n<p>For this Winter VN Jam 2022 submission, here is Elliott's route.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stardew Valley:\u00a0</strong>This is a fangame for Stardew Valley, a farming simulator video game. Much like a Christmas movie rom-com, you come from the big city and fall in love with small town life with small town people. Elliott is a writer who came to Pelican Town to hunker down and finish his novel.</p>\n<p><strong>Heads-up:</strong> The common route has some wine sipping, the\u00a0romantic option has a touch of spice, while the platonic option has a helping of winter blues.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Zoe wrote, created portraits and exterior backgrounds, and coded this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kat Tuesday\u00a0is a multitalented comic artist with a special eye for life's details.
