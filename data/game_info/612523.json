Join our hurt friend in finding the orange who got with his girl and end him! All the sounds, textures, and materials were acquired legally. I created all the cabinets, counters, and characters. All other assets were acquired through quixel, royalty free youtube, and help from my friends. Theres an issue with the water where it won't show up in the packaged mode. I have no idea how to fix this.</p>\n<p>Demo:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Austin Nipper for voicing the banana character.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD<br/></p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>E: Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:17:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/59090bbf32bf73b4e932e2d97c7bb9fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurtleDuckProductions"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
