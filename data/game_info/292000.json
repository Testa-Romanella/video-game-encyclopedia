Also nerfed stars so the rising water will actually threaten you at some point.<br/>Version 7b update: Fixed the 'how to play button' so it actually does something.<br/></p>\n<p>You control a character in the bottom of a seemingly endless vertical tunnel, and are trying to jump your way back out. The controls are very simple: All you have to do is drag the white circle in a direction and release when you feel it has enough speed to launch the character.</p>\n<p>This is a game I\u00a0originally intended to create for mobile, but after discovering webGL I\u00a0thought it would make a better format to host the game so no one has to download anything.</p>\n<p>the source code for this project can be found here if you are interested in the finer details of how I\u00a0made it:\u00a0https://github.com/Pizzaboy10/TunnelJumper.git</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/75858298a023eda3b07073eafebb0b8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DamienJS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
