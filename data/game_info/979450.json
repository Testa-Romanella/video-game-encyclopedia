I am the only game developer, and the theme song is composed by a friend. All the materials used in the game are original materials (without AI or materials borrowed from others), so I spent a long time learning and producing these materials. The first time I wrote a novel, the first time I learned composition and arrangement, the first time I learned Blender to create backgrounds, etc. Since this is my first game, I decided to release it to everyone for free.Although the game still has many shortcomings, I will continue to study hard and create the next good game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T09:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a32d340fa79011699fbcfead9d6266f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["STARxSTAR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["STARxSTAR"], "esrb_rating": null}
