Our aim was to raise the bar of meditative experiences in VR to truly transport you to a beautiful dream location. Birds high up in the sky, waves rolling in on the shore, the wind blowing through palm trees and plants that grow on your private secluded island all contribute both visually and in sound to a surreal experience that practically makes you feel the ocean breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are guided by a meditative voice uniquely tailored to the island environment to help ease you into this truly immersive experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b5679fd837e980dedefd9fb833ab13f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 27}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Better Than Life"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Better Than Life"], "esrb_rating": null}
