It is a single player level-progression game.\u00a0You play as a Human puppet who is training to become a demon. There is a demon AI in the game that if you approach she gives you the task for the level. It is similar to some Mario games in which the player can roam a 2D world and pick level they want to work on then go into a 3D space. There are no constrains to follow a linear path,\u00a0 a player\u00a0can exit a level and jump right into another.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>[WASD} Walking</li><li>[J] Punching</li><li>[Esc] Pause</li></ul>\r\nMechanics:\r\n<ul><li>Save points</li><li>Collecting coins</li><li>Collecting notes</li></ul>\r\nObstacles:\r\n<ul><li>2 different projectile enemies</li><li>1 melee enemy</li></ul>\r\nUpdate:\r\n<p>I made some UI/UX assets and implemented them into a copy of the project.\u00a0There is no downloadable content with the UI/UX because not all the levels had the assets implemented to.
