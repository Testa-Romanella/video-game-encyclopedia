{"id": 769545, "slug": "spheres-victords", "name": "Spheres (victords)", "name_original": "Spheres (victords)", "description": "<p>Spheres is a simple - but addictive - match-3 game with 3 different game modes to keep you playing!</p>\n<p>Try the basic mode to get the basics of the game and to go for the highest scores! Spheres keep falling from the sky and you have to align 3 or more of the same color horizontally or vertically. Try causing chain reactions to get exponentially more points!</p>\n<p>If you want more action and variety, go for the dynamic mode. Use items, avoid locks and locked spheres and combine the rainbow spheres wisely!</p>\n<p>Finally, if you're more into puzzles, the static mode is for you. No falling spheres this time, just a set of spheres in each level, requiring you to either clear them all or get a minimum score. Some of these levels require lots of planning for insane chain reactions!</p>\n<p>Spheres is free and open source.
