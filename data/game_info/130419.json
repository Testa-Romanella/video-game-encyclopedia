Good healthy food has turned bad. Pretentious coffee cups are taking over the world. Nobody is safe.</p>\n<p>Humanity as we know it, went sober. It is a disaster. Out there is not dissimilar from a post-apocalyptic wasteland in reverse. Everything is too good, they are all healthy and caffeinated. They act like zombies, and they are now trapped in a never-ending digital torpor.</p>\n<p>The only way to not succumb is to stay in an altered state of drunkenness. Our last hope is trapped in a pub where he just woke up from a night of drinking surrounded by hipster broccoli and mad coffee cups.</p>\n<p>Drink and fight those absurd creatures. Save humanity from its nonsensical and oxymoronic fate.</p>\n<p>And whatever you do... don't go sober.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>code by Giuseppe Perniola<br/>story &amp; gfx by Giuseppe Masia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87e/87e14c3889fb1b72e0d20494f8cbfc78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pure Fucking Armageddon Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
