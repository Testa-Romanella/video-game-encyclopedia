The game was submitted for publication, but as far as I know never released and has been considered MIA, though it did appear in a few magazine ads at the time. </p>\n<p>Like many of those earlier games it features single screen, character-based movement and was written in compiled BASIC for the 16K Spectrum. Since I have now have the source, I've recompiled it with Colt for the 48K model and added multiple key input rather than the limited single key, INKEY$-based input of the original. Gameplay remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>I don't think it ever had a proper loading screen - at least not on the C15 tape I discovered from 1983 - so I knocked one up in ZX-Paintbrush for the occasion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T09:59:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56d/56dc82716cc34d0b36c9b06344a26f26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmium"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
