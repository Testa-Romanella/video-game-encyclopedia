It's\u00a0my\u00a0first\u00a0game in\u00a0Python.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My purpose was to give it trendy tones - for example Ultra Violet, designated color of the year 2018 by Pantone. This purple shade was a perfect choice to remind cosmos and space to the player. To add a touch of fun, I decided that the my rocket driver would be a cat. It hunts asteroid mice that threaten intergalactic peace. My Asteroids game has become Catsteroid !</p>\n<p>You can control the ship with arrows.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f6080434623cd364a10639d2284f40c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ValwenDynn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
