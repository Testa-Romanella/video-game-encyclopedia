The music will change as the game progresses. When a player is one point away from winning, the music will speed up and become more aggressive. When both players are one point away from winning, the music shifts drastically to tell the players that this is the last round.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bd0bfd6ecca7ee8b4f43578ef8c3184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mjeshonas"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
