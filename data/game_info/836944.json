Click the starting room to reveal its attachment nodes, click any one of these nodes to select it, then click one of the room choices on the left to attach a new room to that node. Use the \"AutoGrow\" button or the \"Continuous\" toggle to automatically add rooms. Feel free to play with some of the other buttons to see what they do.<br/>Clicking \"Play Map\" switches the game to a first person view where the player begins in the starting room and can walk about using the W/A/S/D keys, fight zombies using E, and collect chests by walking over them.<br/>Hold Left Shift to run a little faster, which may be useful if you have trouble with the ramps.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T11:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d4db09bda7a3235c66684025315c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
