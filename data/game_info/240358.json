Control your dreams!", "description": "Warning: Lucid dreams are highly addictive!<br/><br/>Have you ever wanted to fly? be famous? get back in time?? In a lucid dream - you can achieve all of those!<br/><br/>Lucid dreams have stimulated the minds of millions, and inspired famous movies like Inception, Vanilla Sky and the Matrix. It is also believed that Lewis Carroll' Alice in Wonderland is based on his experiences from a lucid dream.<br/><br/>DreamZ is a revolutionary new app that allows you to realize that you are dreaming and control your dream, otherwise known as a Lucid Dream.<br/><br/>How does it work?<br/><br/>As you sleep you go through different phases, ranging from deep sleep to light sleep. The most interesting phase is the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) phase, in which most dreams occur.<br/><br/>Based on your body movements while you're asleep, we are able to know the exact sleep phase you are in, using the built-in iPhone's sensors. <br/><br/>Studies show that during REM, our mind reacts to outside stimulation, such as light, sound or touch, and integrates them into the dream's content. Most of you probably experience a phone ringing during a dream which gets intertwined inside the dream.<br/><br/>DreamZ utilizes this fact and plays specially made audio cues as soon as you enter an REM sleep phase. After several dreams, our mind learns to connect the specific audio cue with the state of being inside a dream, which greatly increase the chances to gaining awareness inside the dream.<br/><br/>    Bottom line - it actually works!<br/><br/>** DreamZ is recommended by top U.S.-licensed doctors on HealthTap **<br/><br/>DreamZ doesn't use any of the questionable, never-proven methods like \"Ambient sounds\" or \"Alpha waves\" that are so common now a days.<br/><br/>DreamZ facilitates advanced algorithms, based on scientific studies that were proved to improve the probability of having lucid dreams.<br/><br/>The same techniques are used today in devices like the NovaDreamer and the REMDreamer. Both very efficient and proven devices, costing $300-$500. This app works in the same way and much cheaper!<br/><br/> <br/>Using DreamZ app, you too can experience the ultimate virtual reality of lucid dreams, without paying hundreds of dollars.<br/><br/>     If you want to learn more about our technique, come to our website: www.dreamzapp.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4ef2f80798eda711681dc267727d750.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adam Siton"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Adam Siton"], "esrb_rating": null}
