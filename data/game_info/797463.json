When the AI in control of the ship woke up, it discovered that all the other systems in control of different parts of the ship have gone haywire, thus it creates a drone- an unfortunate robot called Redd in order to bring back order to the ship by defeating and reintegrating them back to the mainframe.\r\n</p>\n<p>To do so, Redd must get to the main access panel. however, the way is blocked by said haywire systems. Thus begins Redd's endless cycle of scraping and getting scrapped\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>RED\u0398 is a rogue-lite 2d action platformer where the player character has to get to the end of the stage after completing 3 objectives.
