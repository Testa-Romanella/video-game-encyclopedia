Your companion is scared of The Darkness, getting more and more anxious the farther away they are from you or a fire. You can collect twigs to start a fire or keep the fire burning, however you can't stay at one bonfire or place for too long because The Darkness is after you. Watch the comfy meter\u00a0because the more full\u00a0it is, the more comfortable and calm the companion is, and vice versa, the more empty\u00a0it is, the more anxious the companion is.\r\n</p>\n<p>To start a fire you need to have 10 twigs in your inventory and for keeping the fire burning (for a bit more) you need to use 2 twigs. Picking up berries from bushes and feeding them to the companion will make the companion more happy and comfortable.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Use\u00a0WASD\u00a0or arrow keys to move around\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0E\u00a0to pickup twigs and berries\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0F\u00a0to keep the fire burning (needs at least 2 twigs)\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0Q\u00a0to feed the companion\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0X\u00a0to start a fire (needs at least 10 twigs)\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0Space\u00a0to call the companion to your side or put the companion in a place\r\n</li><li>Use\u00a0Esc\u00a0to pause the game\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Check out the GitHub repo</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>LordDeatHunter\u00a0- Developer, Visual artist\r\n</li><li>martinkozle\u00a0- Developer\r\n</li><li>AnixDrone\u00a0- Developer\r\n</li><li>BananaMe\u00a0- Visual artist\r\n</li><li>zodiuxus\u00a0- Sound artist\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T06:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/6350ace47bab910caa9f32116cc96d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
