They start with 1 population.</p>\n<p><strong>Orange</strong> blocks are \"relaxing\". Every residential block within their influence (neighbors and neighbors' neighbors) gain 2 population.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Purple\u00a0</strong>blocks are transports. Every neighbor to a purple block is considered a neighbor to <em>every other</em> purple block.<br/></p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>There is no losing condition.\u00a0Take your time. Each map has a set number of building spots, so the game ends when you filled all of them, or when you've had enough. Try to have the most population possible !</p>\r\nJam\r\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"Roll of the Dice\".\u00a0It was implemented in the idea that dice decide what kind of block you can build. In an effort to keep the dice feeling like dice, they keep their physics, which allow the player to cheat with a bit of effort, by pushing one die with another for example. Since the game is made to be calm and simple, this is not a problem.</p>\r\nThings I would add\r\n<ul><li>A\u00a0simple modding system : right now my maps are simple textures, with white pixels representing ground and black pixels representing sea. It would not be very difficult to add custom maps loading.</li><li>A bette menu.\u00a0I had to make one at the very end.</li><li>Different building types, dice variation.</li><li>Moving stuff.\u00a0Vehicles, birds, whales.</li></ul>\r\nThank you !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be50b4f98aba95debdb2aa44ccf83ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Victor Fanton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
