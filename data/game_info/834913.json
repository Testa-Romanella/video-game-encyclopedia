{"id": 834913, "slug": "holeworm", "name": "Holeworm", "name_original": "Holeworm", "description": "<p>Hobart the Holeworm spends his days among the wormholes of the Bootes Void. His favorite food is temporal paradoxes, which can be found everywhere and everywhen inside special time loops.</p>\n<p>Today is Hobart's lucky day because he just found the longest time loop he's ever seen\u00a0- a whole 10 seconds! That's an almost endless feast of delicious temporal paradoxes.</p>\n<p>Watch out though, because if he touches an echo of himself from a previous timeline, the time loop collapses! That's a bummer for Hobart because it means no more munchies. (He'll be fine though, he's gonna\u00a0find another time loop a while ago.)</p>\n\n<p>Made for Mini Jam 112.
