{"id": 11142, "slug": "bioshock-2-remastered", "name": "BioShock 2 Remastered", "name_original": "BioShock 2 Remastered", "description": "<p>Bioshock 2 is a shooter with RPG elements, centered around resource-management to a great extent: more like an RPG than a shooter. The game is made by 2K studios and represents the final part of a dystopia dilogy \u2014 preceded by the original Bioshock. Its successor is Bioshock Infinite.<br />\nYou play as Big Daddy \u2014 a giant mech with a drill replacing one of the hands. The game, while they both are telling the story of a charming Rapture \u2014 the city descended from Orwell&#39;s and Zamyatin&#39;s pages where the society&#39;s greatest mind have suffered a severe decline.<br />\nThe central feature of the game is the unique abandoned city&#39;s aesthetics \u2014 minding the time Bioshock 2 is still a beautiful title, with detailed drawn water and strange surroundings, never mind the variety of foes.<br />\nThe remaster introduces a 4k resolution \u2014 it is now more enjoyable to explore Rapture and enjoy its various landscapes and sea-filled quarters. Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials,  which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2016-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T16:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7c4/7c448374df84b607f67ce9182a3a3ca7.jpg", "website": "https://2k.com/en-US/game/bioshock-the-collection", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 845, "owned": 6497, "beaten": 783, "toplay": 147, "dropped": 189, "playing": 37}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 117, "ratings_count": 962, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 969, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Digital Extremes", "2K Australia", "2K Marin", "Virtuos", "2K China", "Blind Squirrel"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Take Two Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
