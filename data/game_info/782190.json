The Golden Blobfish keeps the balance of life in the ocean, and without it in its proper place, the waters turn gray and the plants wither away. There are few who would commit such a devious act, and it is up to you to confront the thief. You, Percivl, must take up the trident and use it to eliminate obstacles or maneuver around them in your journey to bring the Blobfish back.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: </p>\n<ul><li>AD to move left and right</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Mouse to aim</li><li>Left Click to throw trident</li><li>Right Click to retrieve trident</li><li>ESC to pause</li><li>ALT + F4 to exit</li></ul>\n<p>The main mechanic of our game is the use of the trident, which functions both as a weapon and as a tool for platforming.
