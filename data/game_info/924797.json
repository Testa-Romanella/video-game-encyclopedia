To grow big and string you desperately need more sugar, which you can then receive by converting the gathered nitrate wand water at your leaves. <br/>Once you grow strong enough, you can start blooming by placing a beautiful flower, which requires quite some resources to upkeep. If you are successfull, you can then finally develop a fruit to reproduce yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d49a9f9f4adc227c736edb5bd5face.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Killerzelle", "Beztix"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
