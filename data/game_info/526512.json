I collected around 300+ public domain works, selected over 60 for this showcase, and added over a dozen 3D sculptures scanned from real statues, that people were so kind to upload for free. The rest of the 200+ works will be displayed in the upcoming dimensions of The OmniGallery.\u00a0 This is a very optimized version of the game. Download the full version for Rift at the Oculus Store or at EternalEchoesVr.com.
