Currently it only has 1 boss battle, but I will be adding more in the near future. I wanted to nail down the gameplay first and get the game to a point where the only thing left to do is add bosses. There are no menus as of yet, but I felt that the current gameplay and look is almost done if not already. Any feedback will be appreciated, along with suggestions. Also please inform me of any bugs you find.</p>\n<p>Game and art by me<br/></p>\n<p>Music and sound effects by Rikileitr</p>\n\n<p>Current to-do list:</p>\n<ul><li>Balance/redo sound effects</li><li>Add timer to keep track of fastest kills</li><li>Add menus</li><li>Work up to a total of 9 bosses</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f40a008ea075110db175f9475261268e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frostdream Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
