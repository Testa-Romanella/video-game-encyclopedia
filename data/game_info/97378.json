The premise of the unit was to make a game with meaning. I wanted to go with the concept of sleep paralysis as it's something I've gone through before as well as some people I know. It's a terrifying experience but there are ways to lessen it and that is what I wanted to get through the gameplay. There are day scenes where the player will communicate with a therapist character, in which they will get advice on how to conquer and lessen the effects. Meanwhile during the night scenes the player will have to stop the nightmare creatures from attacking him while they can't move.</p>\n<p>This project was completed with the help of my talented friend Hayden Reeves who can be found on twitter here;\u00a0https://twitter.com/Greysion</p>\n<p>He helped by implementing his text engine into the game as well as with post processing.</p>\n<p>You can find me at:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/wrennpenn<br/></p>\n<p>http://jillmccloudart.wixsite.com/wrennpennart<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>V2.2 Is up; this has fixes to the retry menus, so they will definitely be working now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e62/e62ea7cf32303fcc3ed7154fc37cc786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinaMil"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
