It works on Edge and Chrome.</p><p>I also advice not using head phones, or use low volume because sound can saturate when there are too many meteors. For some reason, the web version of the game accentuate that.<br/></p><p>The gamepad I used for testing was a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.<br/></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can dowload the DESKTOP version at the bottom of the page!<br/></p>\n<p>_____<br/></p>\n<p>Collect items to grow bigger and gain Power Ups to increase your growth even more!\r\n</p>\n<p>Meteors will fall onto the stage to kill you. If your size comes to 0, it's game over!</p>\n<p>Survive until the end of the countdown! <br/></p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"Connection\". I decided to go for a slime that collects items to grow bigger and bigger, as well as a power up system that will stack with each other. These results in a chain effect where, the more you grow, the more... you grow!</p>\n<p>I just wanted to try the concept, so I used free assets for 3D models, music and sounds. The part I did myself was Programming, UI, Animations and Particle effects.<br/></p>\n<p>The game contains a few minor bugs, but nothing that will crash the game or something like that (as far as I know at least). I hope you'll have fun playing this game! :)<br/></p>\n<p>_____<br/></p>\n<p>Music by HeatleyBros</p>\n<p>Title Screen: 8 Bit Select!</p>\n<p>Game Level: 8 Bit Scrap!</p>\n<p>Game Over: Sad Day<br/></p>\n<p>Victory Screen: Challenge Accepted!<br/><br/>_____</p>\n<p><strong>/!\\ IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE MAC OR LINUX VERSION</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Understand that I  only own a windows laptop and couldn't test these versions. I still  wanted to give the opportunity to try the game without Windows or if the web browser version doesn't work for you. But if  that doesn't work either, well now you know why!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T22:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/333dcc25c4f15b31fc75fd89d704b783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Phiphi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
