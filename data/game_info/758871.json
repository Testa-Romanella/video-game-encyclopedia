Taking place on the planet Mars, the player is given multi-directional control of a rocket powered spacecraft, which they can use to move around the provided play area. However, with only a limited amount of fuel on board their spacecraft, players are advised to move deeper into the play area, with the eventual goal of reach the top of a very tall Martian Mountain. As no fuel data is provided to the player, it is strongly encouraged that use of the spacecrafts propulsion system be applied only when necessary. For as extensive use of the rocket motors will eventually lead to running out of fuel, and the inability to climb up the large mountain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls:\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Left: A or Num Pad 4\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Right: D or Num Pad 6\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Forward: W or Num Pad 8\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Backward: S or Num Pad 2\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Rocket Motor: Spacebar or Num Pad 5\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d973fff51fbc6e17704f697f72f5de2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antonio S."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
