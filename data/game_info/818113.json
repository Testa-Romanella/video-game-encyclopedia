I\u00a0did the art, level, BGM, and coding. Made it within two weeks as a final project for an introductory\u00a0programming course.</p>\n<p>The idea originated from just a game I\u00a0played in my head while riding in the car as a child. Bouncing from left to right on the street, trying to avoid cars and pitfalls. It entertained my as a kid, so I\u00a0figured it might entertain others as well.</p>\n<p>At one point I\u00a0had thoughts of continuing this project, but decide against it. I\u00a0may reuse mechanical ideas in future projects however.</p>\n\r\nRunning the Game\r\n<ol><li>Requires Java Runtime Environment 1.7.0_40 or later</li><li>Download .ZIP package</li><li>Unzip the folder within Windows' file explorer</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T06:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ce767c21e54d6fe6319dc3698fb9a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scotty Rich"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
