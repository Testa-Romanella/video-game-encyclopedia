As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. <br/>This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on.<br/><br/><strong>Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power.</strong><br/>You start with nothing and fight your way to the top.
