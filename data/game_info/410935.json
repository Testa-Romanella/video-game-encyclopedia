A key feature about him is that he is actually flightless.</p>\n<p>During the time of this game's development, game designer and artist, Gigi Read, was working on two dinosaur themed games at the same time. Inspired, the Weebs decided to create another dinosaur game, featuring our beloved icon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the future, Weebs Gigi and Nick Price wish to continue this them forward, and create an even larger world and refine Ptoasty's look within the 3D realm.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de02d8d3057c4e5d2ed5bf95c1ac1add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeepingWeebs"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
