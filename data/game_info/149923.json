Your coach wants you to get better, but you also need to learn to be quicker on your computer. The solution is making every free throw go in if you type out the word on the billboard correctly. Get shots and level up. Time to get good!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow Keys - Move<br/>Space Bar - Shoot</p>\n<p>The closer you are to the basket, the easier the words. The farther you get from the basket, the harder the words. The farther shots are also worth more exp, than the closer shots.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Karen Port - Development, Sfx, Music, Design<br/>Yanni Hajioannou - Development, Sfx, Music, Design, Art</p>\n<p>Gameplay:<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab155698ab5ae4c8844f4427d7fbe3a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yanni"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
