Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>\n<p><em>For A Love I Can\u2019t Express</em> is an interactive experience in memory of a special friendship developed during the pandemic. It\u2019s a visualization of the ubiquitous yet serene emotions I felt in this relationship.</p>\n<p>There is no goal or score in the game, as you travel in a transparent train through the endless space. Each scene represents different emotions, but they all explore the mixed feelings of uncertainty, vulnerability, and sentimentality, especially during this confusing time. You can choose to turn on/off the subtitles, creating unique interpretations based on your own\u00a0experiences.</p>\n<p>How to play: WASD - move, QE - up/down, Right mouse drag - rotate view, C - turn on/off subtitle. When close to the train button, Y - start/stop the train.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T04:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d05d183f973ed3ab3c7ae92ac4bfebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["include-steve-kx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
