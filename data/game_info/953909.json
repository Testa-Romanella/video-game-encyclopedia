The movement has a slight learning curve, so don't expect to be good at the game from the start. Sorry if it's a little laggy, I already optimized the game and it's still really slow. This is intended to be a rage game, so don\u2019t expect to beat it unless you put in some work. All the levels are possible and have been playtested.</p>\n<p>edit: I only encountered the lag\u00a0on opera gx, so if you face it too, try switching to another browser temporarily, it might fix the lag issue.</p>\n<p>FULLSCREEN PLEASE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de41494554e844afee323818b019bdaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sdude123"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
