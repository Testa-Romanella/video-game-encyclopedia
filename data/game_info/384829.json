Six adventurous kids. What could go wrong?</p>\n<p>An entry for Scream Jam 2019, made with a team of three. Jen on art, FutureLoser on music and SFX. I was meant to be on story and character art, but wound up not having time to draw the sprites. So this isn't quite a visual novel, but it does have some lovely pixel backgrounds to enjoy while you read.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: This game contains descriptions of violent acts performed against pre-teen aged children.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Double Warning: While Linux and Mac dists are provided, they have not been tested. No guarantees they'll perform well.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Triple Warning: No guarantees the Windows version will perform without errors either. I didn't have time to fully test every route for bugs. Feel free to drop a comment if you run into a problem, and I'll get on fixing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/4070dc510f8390f6f7578c9fb3f4cc41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jate8d"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
