I am new to the itch.io community and this is my first game jam I have ever entered anywhere. Wow...now that I think of it, its actually one of my first Unity Engine games I have shared with anyone in fact.</p>\n<p>It has been a fun and enlightening experience. I planned things quite sporadically (not recommended hehe) so I think I did go over the 3 hour time limit. I will admit it was probably closer to 4 and half to 5.<br/>I have definitely picked up some tips and techniques for next time to be able to work more efficiently.</p>\n<p>I had to spend some time tweaking the difficulty, as my first build was probably too difficult. There were only 3 alarms allowed and the houses WiFi would be turned off randomly forcing you to have to venture alot<br/>more through the minefield of watchers. Who knows I could maybe put that version up somewhere too. I had other plans for variation and challenge but there just wasn't time (boohoo).<br/>I am hoping it is the right amount of challenging, but I think there is a secret to it that will help you win alot once you know it.</p>\n<p>Anyhow enough of my ramble, I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to hopefully being able to share more with you all sometime. And also to see some of the other great submissions for the many jams and stuff from the community.</p>\n<p>All the best and thanks again.</p>\n<p>Engine Used: Unity<br/>Resources used:</p>\n<p>Playmaker - Available from Unity Asset Store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/playmaker-368</p>\n<p>Used to create all game logic</p>\n<p>Bfxr - Available from:<br/>https://www.bfxr.net/</p>\n<p>Used to create Sound FXs</p>\n<p>All logic, sounds and other items, meshes, UIs, materials and concepts not listed below created by me (Circumpunk)</p>\n<p>Premade Assets:<br/>Character Movement Fundamentals by Jan Ott - Available from Unity Asset Store<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/character-movement-fundament...</p>\n<p>Used for top down character controller</p>\n<p>Free Animated Hologram Shader by Assetbag - Available from Unity Asset Store<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/free-animated-hologram-effect-...</p>\n<p>Used for WiFi and Watcher sight material/textures</p>\n<p>Handpainted houses - by A3D - Previously available from Unity Asset Store<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/hand-painted-houses-61860</p>\n<p>Used for House Meshes</p>\n<p>Many thanks<br/>Circumpunk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c59b258001d81ef55984fd609c8f0c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Circumpunk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
