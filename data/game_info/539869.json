Both the first and second stages are powered by Space AR X Marline engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. <br/>Unlike most rockets, which are expendable launch systems, since the introduction of the Full Thrust version, Flacon 9 is partially reusable, with the first stage capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved for the first time on flight 20 in December 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc8768674765553b15cfaf442a36edd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["NCGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
