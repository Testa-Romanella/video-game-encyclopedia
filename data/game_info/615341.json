{"id": 615341, "slug": "slope-dope", "name": "Slope Dope", "name_original": "Slope Dope", "description": "<p>A foolhardy skier decides to take on the world's first quadruple black diamond course, and what's more, he wants to do it FAST. He will have to be extremely careful, as the course features dangerous obstacles such as trees and bears. A truly absurd amount of bears. Really, just more bears than anyone could have reasonably expected.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to ski from checkpoint to checkpoint until you reach the bottom of the course. You will only have a limited amount of time to reach the next checkpoint, but you can increase the timer by collecting pickups, skiing between blue flags, and doing flips. Any extra time is turned into points when you reach the next checkpoint, so move fast to get a high score!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming and Level Design: Trenton Coggeshall and Trevor Irvin</p>\n<p>3D Models: Trevor Irvin</p>\n<p>Music: Incompetech</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T05:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435a1767e1f0ea6af0bdf3b67180865c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sleepyrogue", "kodiak425"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
