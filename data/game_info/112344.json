Will you make it home?</p>\n<p>Created across the span of a year by a single developer, Planetary Escape is not likely to be similar to any game you've played before. It's an audiogame, meaning that there is no visual output for the game--only sound. Headphones are required, and it's important to make sure they are on the right ears.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c2829e5a79b93b205ffefe9595826c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alari"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
