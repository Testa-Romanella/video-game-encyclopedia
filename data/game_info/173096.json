{"id": 173096, "slug": "life-is-full-of-inspiration", "name": "Life is Full of Inspiration", "name_original": "Life is Full of Inspiration", "description": "<p>Life is Full of Inspiration is a cross-platform desktop video game written in<br/>Java. The game was developed for the first official Game Dev Underground Jim Jam<br/>(https://itch.io/jam/jimjam) in approximately 48 hours. It's just a really<br/>casual riddle game, but it ties well into the jam's theme, which was<br/>inspiration. The reward for solving each riddle is a picture that my wife and I<br/>have taken at some point since getting married. Basically, the lesson I'm trying<br/>to teach is that inspiration can be found everywhere around you; you just have<br/>to be willing to get up and experience life.</p>\n\n<p>I've uploaded an executable jar file which does not require installation. However, you need to have a recent Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed to run it. You can visit\u00a0https://www.java.com/en/ for more information. I'll also upload platform-specific installers as I build them. They should install just like any normal application, and you can follow the regular steps (Control Panel on Windows) to uninstall the game completely. I promise I'm not doing any crazy stuff to your system.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/87975c6356924a55e9fb506e52e42da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slug_Overdose"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
