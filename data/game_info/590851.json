As a way to break the stigma of obesity and sedentary lifestyles, take care of both your health and your pet by doing workouts. Get rewards that you can use to purchase in-game cosmetics and rooms for your pet! Work towards completing badges as well as collecting all of the adorable pets.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAvailable as a cross-platform game, you can play it on your browser (full-screen is recommended!) or download it on your phone from the Google Play Store. Fret not, the iOS version is coming soon!\r\n<br/>Note: Internet connection is required to run the game!</p>\r\n\u00a0How do I play?\r\n User Accounts\r\n<p>\r\nYou must first register for an account by providing your email and a password. After the first registration, you can continue to play the game by logging in. You can also reset your password in case you forget it.\r\n</p>\r\n\ud83d\udc3e Pets and Leveling Up\r\n<p>\r\nOn your first journey, you get to choose from 6 pets. This pet cannot be changed until you reach the maximum level so choose wisely! You can rename your pet and view your level progress through its profile. Once you reach the highest level of 40, you get to pick a new pet from the remaining list of pets. Try to collect them all, but beware that it takes a lot of dedication and consistency to get there!\r\n</p>\r\n Activities, Rewards and Badges\r\n<p>\r\nYou will receive experience points, health points and coins whenever you add a new activity. Your pet's health decreases over time so try and keep it up to get the highest possible rewards each time you add a workout! View a history of your activities from the History button and your badge progress from the Badges button. Each badge has 4 tiers and can be achieved over time as long as you are consistent, do your best and go for gold!\r\n</p>\r\n Items, Rooms and the Shop\r\n<p>\r\nUse the coins you received from your workouts to purchase in-game items such as cosmetics for your pets and rooms to decorate your background. Bought items will immediately transfer to your inventory, where you can choose to equip one item at a time. Upgrading a room gives you 4 colors of each room type, which can also be selected from the Items button.\r\n</p>\r\n Who made this game?\r\n About The Project and Me\r\n<p>\r\nAs a Computer Science student specializing in Web Programming, I wanted to develop an application that had equal parts fun and serious, virtual and real. Taking on game development was a major shift in my work and what I am used to. Although the learning curve was not steep, this project would not be made possible without the guidance I received from some very special people.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWorry was an understatement to how I felt this 12-week project would turn out, but the passion that drove me to create this <em>gamified</em> fitness tracker and the people that I hope to help and inspire, pushed me to conquer this fear. I wanted to motivate people to take better care of their health by <em>gamifying</em> it. The idea to use pets as an avatar was inspired by my late pets, Mochi, a red toy poodle and Kitty, a stray. They brought me so many joyous moments that I will forever be grateful for.\r\n</p>\r\n Socials and Links\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out more of my work through my website: \r\nselsapingardi.rf.gd</li>\n<li>Connect with me on LinkedIn: selsapingardi</li>\n<li>Feel free to follow me on Instagram: @selsa.css</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n Assets and Other Works\r\n<p>The art found in this game was mostly made by me, though they were inspired by a couple of talented artists. The assets used for the room decoration was made by Mucho Pixels, while the pixel art for the user interface was created by Fast Solutions and customized by me.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:26:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/830f7d2db2414f4bd9f04e6125743903.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Selsa"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
