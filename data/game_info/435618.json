Unfortunately all of your crew was exterminated by some space environment issues and now you are totally alone.</p>\n<p>All the stuff in your dome was mixed up during an earthquake and you just regain your consciousness and see the big mess. Now it's up to you to survive and keep the machines alive till the shuttle arrives and rescues you. <br/>Your job is to create O2 and reduce the CO amount with your <strong>O2 Generator</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You need also some food and water which will be produced by the <strong>Greenhouse</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>To call for help and your rescue shuttle, you have to use the <strong>Radio Station</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And to survive the passage from your dome to the shuttle you have to collect some damaged space suit parts (<strong>Three</strong> of each) <strong>Helmet</strong>, <strong>Pants</strong>, <strong>Jacket</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>and combine them to one functional on your <strong>Workbench</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If everything is done, you can leave the dome through <strong>The Exit</strong> and enjoy your safe trip back home.</p>\n\n<p>BUT every machine is pretty damaged and break from time to time, so you have to repair them frequently.<br/>You have to have a look at the pipes aswell. Usually they pump out the Carbon Monoxid out of the dome, but even the pipes can break and your dome fills slowly with the dangerous gas. So go and fix the <strong>Pipes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Next to that, everything in your dome needs some Power so the most important machine is your <strong>ENGINE</strong>. Throw everything you don't need into it and produce some electricity with burning them. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Even the Exit needs some power to let you go. <br/>soooo..... <strong>KEEP THE ENGINE ALIVE</strong></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0GamePlay</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Stressful coordination of various tasks</li><li>Hunt the highscore and beat the time</li><li>Fix your machines and pipes</li><li>Contact Home, produce Oxygen, craft a space suit and fill your stomach</li><li>Burn stuff, even with a purpose or just to see stuff burning</li><li>Survive the Mars - Flee back to Earth</li><li>Scan your environment for interesting stuff</li><li>Mostly Randomized Level</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong> Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WebGL Version seems to be still buggy, we recommend to use the normal download versions!</li><li>MAC and LINUX version are not tested</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>W/A/S/D - Movement</li><li>E - Use / Activate / Repair</li><li>R - Scan Grenade</li><li>ESCape - Opens and closes the pause menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Helping Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Read the Tutorial</li><li>Keep calm</li><li>Find all 4 Machines and remember their position (O2, Radio, Workbench, Greenhouse)</li><li>The Engine is always in the center of the Dome</li><li>The Exit is always in the north wall</li><li>Check below other objects for important items</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Some typos and grammar issues</li><li>Hard AF</li><li>Volume Mixing can be a problem</li><li>Some Graphic Glitches</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>LD-Entry</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong><br/><em>Christian</em></p>\n<ul><li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/key_user</li></ul>\n<p><em>Christian</em></p>\n<ul><li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/DeathStorm1987<br/></li><li>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/deathstorm_de/</li><li>I would like to stream your Games, just enter it in this Form: https://forms.gle/eSwKEnw2Y3v3q46J8</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>We cant wait for your response and feedback!
