Only two months of development]<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Non-Standard battle-system stolen based on a flash game I half remember from 8 years ago. you will get to click on circles.<br/>Go watch the video, it is easier for me to explain that way;</li><li>Open World RPG, It is more of a Legend of Zelda ('86) than a Breath of the Wild, </li><li>Moddable (partially, better support in further updates) watch modding video for more information;</li><li>Complex self-balancing, challenging, combat system and mechanics;</li><li>Certified(tm) funny and engaging RPG story. </li><li>SOME sound-effects and PRESENT music;</li><li>Asynchronous multi-threading.

They are slow to calculate and inaccurate, thank you past-self who programmed them<br/></p></li></ul>\n<ul><li>No settings, some windows pre-testers complained that windows audio was a bit too high, so please lower your audio before playing the game if you like having working ears</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Thanks to development debt, Japanese characters aren't supported by the engine, that is planned to be fixed asap</li></ul>\r\nFuture Development\r\n<p>Before we get into the technical details of this; here is the gist of what is planned to be added in the future:</p>\n<ul><li>Firstly, obviously, more game</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Expand levels, improve assets, add mechanics:<ul><li>Add additional AI intelligence levels</li><li>Improve UI feel, layout, assets, menus, etc</li><li>Improve support and add different weapon sight shapes</li><li>Decide if I should actually add charm mechanics to this game or let it be</li><li>Consumables</li><li>Level Up prompt, more involved level up process;</li><li>Balancing and pacing improvements</li><li>uhhhh... terrible promise but... everything can and maybe will be improved????????</li><li>Improve the level up system, it was a bit rushed during crunch</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>General architectural redesign and bug fixing:\r\n<ul><li>The way Hit-boxes work is beyond stupid, it needs to be remade from the ground up.</li><li>\u300cCode Restructuring\u300d (The F stands for Fun)</li><li>Completely change the way I draw to the screen to support multiple resolutions;</li><li>Make code more readable (for me);</li><li>Moddable but not modder friendly, need to improve;</li><li>I don't think there are any major bugs. Like you know, game crashing, save corrupting, unfixable by the end-user, capital B Bugs................ Someone's gonna crash, for sure, and somehow their entire OS will be deleted by some sort of accidental day zero vulnerability in the windows clippy resummoning code, fear the paper clip FEAR</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nDisclaimers (fun!!!!)\r\n<ul><li>Early-Development\u00a0Demo  \r\n</li><li>Assets are: either pre-existing Hololive\u00a0things I \"\"stole\"\" from the official-hololive website or: the mouses cursors I actually stole from: this  OR: Things I poorly made myself in GIMP. (<em>linux user btw</em>);<ul><li>Tl;Dr the art is not impressive;  \r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Some sound effects are free (libre)   sound effects, others I simply sampled some of the \"idols\" talking,   yelling etc. Music either MIDI made by myself, or Spanish guitar   recordings, by myself;<ul><li>TL;Dr the sound design is not impressive;  \r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>I coded this engine;<ul><li>Tl;Dr the engine is not impressive;\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>This game and my person do their utmost to comply with the following code of conduct in relation to the hololive derivative work guidelines<br/></li></ul>\r\nConclusion\r\n<p>NOW GO SON!
