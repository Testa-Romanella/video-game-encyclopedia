Become a playtester and explore the liminal spaces of an old apartment building to unravel the mystery behind JMC Gaming Enterprises...<br/><br/>Hello, I'm\u00a0<strong>Matthew Stanton</strong>, and I'm the lead developer at\u00a0<strong>JMC Gaming Enterprises!</strong>\u00a0You've been chosen from our list of applicants to play-test our new game (which as of now does not have a title).<br/><br/>Not only that, tech department said they made a breakthrough with a new device (they won't clue me in but I hope it's big). Apparently they're going to 'play-test' their device the same day we play-test the game, which is strange, but whatever. Anyway, please contact me ASAP at this number: (061)219\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or you can reply to this email, and we will arrange a time for you.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/><em>-Matt</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1373426cc72011da200b751e2b378f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEVBEEF"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
