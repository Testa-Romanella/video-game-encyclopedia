Controllers may not work correctly, this hasn't been extensively tested yet.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>I coded the game with initial help from the Asteroids Tutorial by Scripting is Fun. They really helped with the first two weeks or so of creating fundamentals for the game.</p>\n<p>In-game I use particles from the Unity Particle Pack, music from Ultimate Game Music Collection and audio from Universal Sound FX. Controller support is from Rewired.
