The mysterious spirit hound Echo is far from home, but with her by your side, exploration is as simple as a game of fetch.  Throw a lance and Echo will scurry to grab it, eager to yank it free from walls, ancient mechanisms, enemies, and whatever else you manage to impale.  Work together with Echo to solve puzzles, conquer bosses, and explore the Kingdom of the Esker.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This project is still in the early stages of development.  Thus, the nature of the game could change considerably before its final release.  Particularly in relation to system requirements such as memory needed.
