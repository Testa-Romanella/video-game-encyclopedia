I'm Joel, a 15 years old student from Spain. This is my first game, I've been working last months on it while I was learning programming. It isn't finished yet, but everyday I'm working harder. If you like the game and you wish to support it I strongly recommend you to buy it now, because the price will probably be raised a euro or so, and you will support me :)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYear 2151, the world is now ruled by a supercomputer, that cannot be harmed. The last few humans code a computer virus, named Death, whose purpose is to destroy the computer's server and free the humanity. All their hopes remain in you. Death Injection is a top-view plataformer, where you use your powers to increase your speed, kill enemies, go trough walls...
