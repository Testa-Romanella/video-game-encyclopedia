Also, the enemies might bug out and not die sometimes and one green guy walks on air coz his navmesh didn't work properly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e952d6a26d719741931cb9447dabdd6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crystalline_bonsai"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
