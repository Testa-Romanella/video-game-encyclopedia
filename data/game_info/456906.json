The planet Mars is 35% terraformed, finally enough to allow the playing of the game of.. Golf!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGolf across an infinite* rocky Martian surface. Discover golfing obstacles that make us Earthlings gasp in awe!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n---<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Infinity is impossible to represent on any non-quantum computer. In actuality there are roughly 25,770,000,000 golf holes in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn 2020, NASA will launch the Perseverance rover to search for life and golf on Mars. The journey there will take 200 days,<br/>\r\nIf you were to play one hole of Golf On Mars every 30 seconds during that journey, you would only be able to complete 0.002% of the game (576000 holes).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you were a paleolithic hunter-gatherer gazing up at the Red planet one night during your traversal of the ice bridge connecting Russia to Alaska<br/>\r\nat the last glacial maximum 24515 years ago and a time traveler brought an iPhone for you and your tribe to ritually play a hole of Golf On Mars every 30 seconds,<br/>\r\nit would take until the present day to complete all the holes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut this is not a realistic simulation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor example, if the ball is 16 pixels wide on your screen then the typical hole will be 1200 pixels away.<br/>\r\nScaling this to the size of a real ball (1.68 inches), it's as if the hole is only 3.5 yards away!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA realistic 18 hole golf course where the fairways are 3.5 yards away would only require about 1300 square feet of land.<br/>\r\nHowever, gravity on Mars is 38% that of Earth's gravity, so you could hit a ball 7 times farther, or roughly 1400 yards for a good player.<br/>\r\nThis 18 hole course then needs to be to 64000 square feet. You could cover the entire surface of Mars with 241 billion of these golf courses.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTherefore, you could easily fit all the holes in Golf On Mars on the surface of Mars.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMars is par 3, so aim to finish in under 77 billion strokes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd232e222cf1166096adc7dd65a9e69_tpw3kds.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Captain Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Captain Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
