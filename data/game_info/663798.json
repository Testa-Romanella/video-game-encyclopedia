Sometimes you need to stand on a switch to raise a drawbridge and reach the goal, as seen below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In some levels you can morph into a different shape that lets you move exactly one tile at a time, but at the cost of not being able to stand up. In this mode, the only way you can change orientation is by moving across a bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can also move your player from one side of the tile to the other, perhaps by traversing a Mobi\u00fcs strip.
