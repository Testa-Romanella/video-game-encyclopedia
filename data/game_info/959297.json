I call it Martian Defense. To be honest, my condition of having it rotate 180 degrees and then spawning an ale_beam was not a dead end, but very hard to do. The game as is\u00a0stands unfinished unfortunately, but\u00a0me and my older brother are planning to work on it and flesh it out later. I really like this game, and I'm not at all done with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T00:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e88755251c2fa6913abdfdc8b9e30a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Contemplative Horsey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
