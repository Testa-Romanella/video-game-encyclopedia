One night Pooge is visited by a ghost who tells him to change his ways before it's too late.<br/><br/>So Pooge decides that he must change his ways to escape his fate, he goes around the town giving gifts to his fellow\u00a0Villies but everyone's wants are not as straightforward as others, so he must think carefully what people want, will you succeed in making everyone happy, and will Pooge realise that \"Less truly is more, and happiness is vital and that's worth more than any title\"\r\nI may have overscoped with my first idea of this game (initially they wouldn't give you as clear clues as they do, meaning you'd have to work out more than just images, but hey, it's a game jam and it happens!\r\nWhat To Do:\r\n<ol><li>Talk to the villagers (villies) and see what is making them sad</li><li>Find the items with the matching symbols and give them the items!</li><li>Some villies may require something else off of you!</li><li>Make them all happy</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Give gifts to your fellow Villies and make them happy!</li><li>You will notice the music change and the environment change as you make more of them happy</li><li>You may even notice yourelf change!</li></ul>\r\nI'd describe this as a wholesome story game where your character (Pooge) realises that there is more to life than the materialistic thing he owns, and tasks himself with making everyone else happy. Which I honestly believe is a good message for life.<br/><br/>Hope everyone had a good jam.
