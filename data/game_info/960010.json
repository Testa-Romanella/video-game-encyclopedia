This thrilling adventure takes place in the Japanese-inspired cyberpunk universe of Katana-Ra, and features stealth combat, puzzles, and clues to uncover. With stunning graphics and an engaging storyline, you are on a timed effort to uncover the truth behind this dastardly deed!<h3>Gameplay</h3>You have 8 hours. The game plays out in real-time and from your start at night on the outskirts of the Clan Kata village, to 8 hours later when dawn breaks - you need to find and decipher the clues that will lead to your discovery of the real murderer responsible. You can choose to play in full stealth mode or mix in action combat when you want. Beware though, death has consequences. Dying advances time while your soul resurrects, so pick your fights carefully - and make sure you win.<h3>The Detective Shinobi</h3>The game happens entirely in one complex, multi-tiered level of vertical and horizontal traversal. You will need to explore outdoor and indoor areas to find clues. Using your Shinobi Sense, you will find areas of interest, then explore them to uncover the truths you need. Pick up things you find in the village to craft items you need and pay attention to noise and events throughout the night as you head to your inevitable conclusion - or demise.<h3>From the Developer</h3>With Shinobi Rising we wanted to give you a light and easy entry to the dynamic world of Katana-Ra. We have multiple premium titles headed to you over the coming years, and we wanted to start out with an easily accessible entry point to introduce you to the game universe and to one of its main protagonists.
