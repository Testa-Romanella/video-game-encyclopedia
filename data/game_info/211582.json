However, not 3 days after i finished the first level, the software i was using at the time (java) was updated. Now, the only computer the game will work on is my old laptop.</p>\n<p>i took the liberty of converting my old files into a product that i can at least readily show off (IE an executable / Game Maker).</p>\n<p>im still working on this story; turning it into a sandbox adventure game rather than a flight shooter/bullet hell shooter.</p>\n<p>truly, what made me go back to THIS project, is the memories of games from when i was a kid. i remembered that all the good 2D ports at least let you do stuff, while all the bad ones i could only ever play once because they were stiff and boring... after playing this (let's be honest) tech demo one nighti realized that i too was making a stiff game with good/okay visuals...</p>\n<p>but what if that game was good, able to fly and interact with the world as a bat? well the idea might sound stupid to some, but i'm still working on this and many more projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09e64939223f410e1b67821051808b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lostchild14000"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
