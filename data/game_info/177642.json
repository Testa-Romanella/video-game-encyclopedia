It offers classic arcade gameplay that mixes elements from Megaman (boss fight), Goemon 2 (quests, money &amp; items), Shank 2 (battle mechanism, survival mode) and recent Moba (hero powers mechanism). <br/><br/>You play as a knight who tries to unveil the mystery behind the spooky events occuring lately : Undead rising at night, hordes of gobelin, orcs, tritons, elves, yetis and heretics suddenly becoming hostile, monstrous creatures blocking the path of travellers... <br/>Along the way, you'll enroll new heroes, each with its unique gameplay. Each of them have 3 basic powers, 1 ultimate power and a passive power and a different role (Tank, healer, dps, pets, multi task, special gameplay, etc...) <br/>The player can earn money from enemies, bosses, quests or chests and uses it to buy items to help him on its journey.
