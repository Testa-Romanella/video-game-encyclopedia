Then download Mimic: The Game! Here\u2019s how you play:<br/><br/>1. The app has four colored buttons: yellow, green, purple, and reddish-orange.<br/>2. Watch and pay attention to the pattern, which starts with one button.<br/>3. When you mimic the pattern correctly, you head to the next round and another button is added to the pattern.<br/><br/>As long as you correctly follow the pattern, you\u2019ll stay alive and can keep playing. But make a mistake and the game is oven and you\u2019ll have to restart!<br/><br/>***Twists &amp; Turns***<br/><br/>While gameplay is easy to understand \u2013 watch out: there are twists and turns!<br/><br/>&gt; Every few rounds, the app rotates the position of the buttons (i.e. the yellow button will move from the top-left to the bottom-right, etc.).<br/>&gt; Later rounds have time limits, so you don\u2019t have the luxury of replaying long sequences in your head \u2013 you need to swiftly decide or else!<br/><br/>***Earn Points***<br/><br/>You can also points along the way, which you can exchange for an extra life, or use to stop rotations between rounds. This can make the difference between adding to your High Score or starting over.<br/><br/>***Leaderboard Integration***<br/><br/>While you can play the app anytime and anywhere (including at school when you should be paying attention, or at work when you\u2019re supposed to be getting stuff done!), you can also compete against your friends and other players around the world by checking out their score on the Leaderboard.  Do you have what it takes to be the best?<br/><br/>**Boost Your Concentration***<br/><br/>In addition to being fun, you\u2019ll find that the app can boost your concentration, coordination and memory; all of which can help you in other aspects of your life.<br/><br/>***Questions?
