It was created and submitted as a final project for one of my early game development classes and has never seen the light of day since. I recently re-discovered it on my hard drive and decided it should be available to play and experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As stated above, it is unfinished. It is missing some\u00a0audio as well as some extra features that were originally planned but cut due to time constraint. You may experience some bugs, but overall it is a running game that can be completed in about 10-15 minutes or less.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was heavily inspired by the Resident Evil series. From the gameplay to the\u00a0in game items, and even the sound cue when starting a new game, the influence is very obvious.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe game controls like any other typical FPS:\r\n<p>Mouse - Aim</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>Tab - Aim Down Sights</p>\n<p>R - Reload</p>\n<p>P - Pickup</p>\n<p>F - Flashlight On/Off</p>\n<p>H - Heal</p>\n<p>Space - Pause</p>\n<p>1/2 - Switch Weapons</p>\n\n<p>For more about myself, development updates, and game announcements follow me on\u00a0Twitter.
