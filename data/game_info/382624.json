We got additions, substractions - even divisions! - we got it all!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Calcustation is an arcade/puzzle game . The goal of the game is to bring the trains to the correct doors. All the doors have numbers on them and operators. If the train number doesn't match the door number, then the door operator will be applied to the train number and the train will go back in the stack. The more trains go back in the stack, the slower they will get. The game stops whenever a train's number goes under 0 or above 100, or if there is a train collision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will you\u00a0be able to beat all four game modes and unlock the ending?
