Despite that, besides the time dedicated for coding,\u00a0the maze, 3d models and soundtrack were made by me. It is, however, working normally and you will be able to enjoy it without any problems! The objective is to escape the labyrinth, and for that you need to find a mysterious sphere that changes places from time to time, before your time runs out! You have only 4 minutes for that.<strong>\u00a0** TIP: use the arrow keys to move the player **</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T08:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dcd540163c7ea08956c16071008bb2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marcioaragaodev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
