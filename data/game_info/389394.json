Doing so softlocks the program until you restart it, I kinda put in a debug message that I forgot to remove afterwards\u00a0<em>(I know that you're going to press it anyways but hey there's no harm in tellin' ya).</em></p>\n<p>The game is very unfinished so remember that when the lights go out,\u00a0<em>that's basically when the game ends</em>, ALTHOUGH, some interactable objects\u00a0<em>DO</em>\u00a0get different dialogue popups.</p>\n<p>If you get an error message about some crust shader or something, just restart the game until it works.</p>\n<p>To play the game, extract the contents of the zip into a folder and then click the exe file!</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as this game is highly unfinished, I'm planning to work more on it after the gamejam so that I can release a better version with all the originally planned content,\u00a0<em>(and trust me, there's a LOT of those).</em></p>\n<p>But all in all, this was definitely a fun and educational experience!</p>\n<p>So uh yeah! Hope ya enjoy this fun little test I put together and look forward for the enhanced version!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c33d3f1ae78d68f27aaa1d58849858b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AverageGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
