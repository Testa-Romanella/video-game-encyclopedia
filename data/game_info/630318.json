Bots attack both players and all other bots.</li>\n<li>Whoever gets the most kills wins but you just play as long as you want because there is no end to the game.</li>\n<li>Bots enable you to score extra kills but can't win the game because they don't respawn so their score is not recorded.</li>\n<li>No points are scored if you kill yourself.</li>\n<li>Bots explode in fire if you cause enough damage.</li>\n</ul>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul>\n<li>Don't set Max\u00a0bots in the Options menu too high without first trying out lower values because\u00a0this can slow down\u00a0the game making it unresponsive if your computer is not powerful enough. On my low power laptop I couldn't handle more than 300 Max\u00a0bots but I\u00a0am allowing up to 1000 Max\u00a0bots because I assume a more\u00a0powerful computer could handle it but I could not test it.</li><li>In the Options menu the Max\u00a0bots\u00a0allowed\u00a0is lower if spawning bots every minute\u00a0than if spawning bots\u00a0once.</li></ul>\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n<ul>\n<li>Known Bug: Teleport sometimes causes gun to disappear.

Use LAN mode for single player.</li><li>Internet mode: Requires a home Internet connection and setting up port forward 7777 UDP/TCP on your router. This is the most common method to use to play over the Internet.</li><li>Wi-Fi cell phone hotspot : Requires running off the same Wi-Fi cell phone hotspot. This method only works if everyone playing is in the same house.</li><li>Virtual LAN over Internet : Requires a VPN that supports Virtual LAN over Internet. This method can be used to play over the Internet if you don't want to setup port forward on your router.</li></ol>\r\nLAN mode\r\n<ul><li>To use <strong>LAN mode</strong> you need a working LAN but you can run the server and client on the same computer for testing with no LAN setup required.</li><li>If running the server and client on the same computer, change the Settings-&gt;Common Resolution to 680x480 so you can see the server and client side-by-side.</li></ul>\r\nServer\r\n<ol><li>Connect the computer to the Internet.</li><li>Start the game, select <strong>LAN mode</strong> and press <strong>Play</strong>.</li></ol>\r\nClient\r\n<ol><li>Connect the computer to the Internet.<br/>\n</li><li>Start the game, select <strong>LAN mode</strong> and press <strong>Find games</strong> then select the game from the <strong>Server list</strong>.</li></ol>\r\nInternet mode\r\nServer\r\n<ul><li>When using <strong>Internet mode </strong>the server can't be connected to a WI-FI cell phone hotspot.</li><li>When using <strong>Internet mode </strong>the server must be connected to a typical home Internet with a router so you can setup port forward 7777 UDP/TCP.</li><li>In Step 2, you must setup port forward 7777 UDP/TCP on your router.
