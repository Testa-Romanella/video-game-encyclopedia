We can\u2019t see all of them with the naked eye, but we are able to study them using telescopes, and some can even be examined under the microscope. Join us as we explore the Solar System, from our closest neighbour the Moon, to Mars, asteroids out by Jupiter \u2013 and beyond! We\u2019ll have some real Moon and Mars rocks to look at, and we\u2019ll try to find an asteroid too\u2026</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T09:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99a/99a7683c53d7aa69103fdd4f25c7568b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rhys Lamble"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
