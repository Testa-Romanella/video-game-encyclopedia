The plight of the rhinos is something close to our hearts and we thought that something like this could bring awareness to those not in the know, and inspire people to take action. Education and social causes are ways of making games that make a difference.</p>\n<p>This is a simple game where you are controlling a decoy rhinoceros to lure poachers into traps. You must avoid being shot by the poachers and use your decoy to prevent the other real rhinos from being shot. <br/></p>\n<p>Categories we're trying to compete in:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Best Game</li><li>Best Technical Game</li><li>Best Educational</li><li>Best Mobile Game</li><li>Best Aesthetics</li><li>Community Favourite</li></ul>\n<p>Torn Team Members:</p>\n<ul><li>Chris O'Brien - Design Lead</li><li>Francesca Fitzgerald - Designer</li><li>Kayla Molenaar - Art Lead</li><li>Jordan Zunde - Programming Lead</li><li>Damien Grobler - Programmer</li><li>Jude Cooksey - Music Lead, Art</li></ul>\n<p>This game was built to be compatible with both mobile and desktop gaming.
