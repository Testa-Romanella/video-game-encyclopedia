She will come across a Great Kakigori Shaver that must be repaired to reach her goal in later builds.</p>\n<p>The game is overall a sort of \u201cmy first test game\u201d, where I intend to set foundations and prototype some ideas I have planned for possible future titles. We made it just to prove we can make games, and to set a minimum standard on what I expect future games of mine to look and feel like.</p>\n<p>In the month-long span of the Game Jam, we were able to develop some extent of the game\u2019s first level. There currently isn\u2019t much of an objective to the game at the moment, but you can run, wall kick, and glide in an immersive, snowy mountainside.</p>\n<p>In the future, we intend to add more to the game, three short levels, but those will come at an unspecified date in the future, when our team is ready to find the time to get the rest of the game done. Even then, this game is intended to be super small and not much more than a 15-minute journey.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0- Controls</strong> (Controls will be customizable in the future.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can use either Keyboard or an Xbox Controller</p>\n<p>(support for different kinds of controllers may come in the future)</p>\n\n<p><strong>WASD/Left Analog Stick</strong> \u2013 Move</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Mouse/Right Analog Stick </strong>- Camera</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Space/A\u00a0</strong>\u2013 Jump, Wall Kick off wall (When midair) Deploy/Put away glider</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0ESC/P/Menu</strong>\u2013 Pause the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318b05e3f98d76b6d84ccc533f2b433b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Manuel Saenz", "1337gamer15", "bbruce", "Jcoop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
