{"id": 152750, "slug": "sms-tactics", "name": "SMS Tactics", "name_original": "SMS Tactics", "description": "<p>SMS Tactics is a free new game by the creator of Synonymy about communication and manipulation. It runs silently in the background while the actual game is played simply by texting back and forth with your friends.You and your opponent are both assigned 'WinWords'. If you're able to get your friend to text you your WordWord before they get you to text you theirs, you win! There's no time limit, and the game is designed to be played over several weeks and force you to question whether each engagement is a ploy to illicit the desired response. Either player can also win by guessing the word their opponent is trying to get them to say. </p><p>Perhaps the most elegant feature of SMS Tactics is the fact that it only needs to run on one device. If your friend agrees to a game via text, they don't need to install anything - just keep texting you as normal. This makes it possible to play easily with iPhones, windows phones, or any device that's capable of sending texts.</p><p>http://www.smstactics.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9a875b7d0c60a076b380d71ede5af55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Synonymy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
