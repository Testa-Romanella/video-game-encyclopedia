Unfortunately, your club is closed\u00a0tonight...</p>\n<p>But you have another option. You could fence with the Brazil Fencing Club, located in the exotic lands of Brazil. What? South America? No... This Brazil is located in the foil fencing capital of the world: Indiana.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Brazil Indiana's Fencing Club, We never close. We have fencers practicing at our club 24-hours a day and 365 days a year. Anyone anywhere can fence with this club. No long trips necessary. This is because our club only exists in Virtual Reality! Hope you will join us at practice today.</p>\n<p>The Brazil Fencing Club VR Game is a currently a game prototype.\u00a0 A game prototype allows testing the concept of a game to see if it worth developing. The game\u00a0currently has one simple coach-led bladework exercise and two simple fencers to fence against, one right-handed, one left-handed. The vision for the game is to have many coach led bladework exercises and a large pool of crazy fencers to practice against. Also for players who wish to do more of the game, they will be able to create their own unique fencers with simple scripting and share them with others.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a foil fencing game. I may expand into the other two weapons later if there is enough interest.\u00a0 It is also designed for players that have some fencing experience,\u00a0 the game doesn't (at this time anyway) teach fencing, so non-fencers may not enjoy it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Should be compatible with many VR headsets. I have tested it on Windows Mixed Reality and Quest 2 with PCVR.</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a7565044be751e1f3006018f1724da3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CounterParry"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
