World powers had clashed together to test their might and the only result was the destruction of Earth.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>All of the major world powers had activated their defense mechanisms, causing our home, planet Earth, to wither into desolation. The attack between nations was measured by immense consequences suffered by not only the people but Earth as well. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Nuclear warheads were launched from each of the world powers which blanketed our world in radioactive clouds, and causing a mass extinction of most life on Earth.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Only a small population managed to survive the chaos the powers ensued. The ones that survived decided to collect all the DNA that was not contaminated by the radioactivity, with the purpose of start life anew on other planet like Earth.\r\n  </p>\n<p>It was called Project <strong><em>Ark</em></strong> and it was humanity\u2019s last hope. <strong><em>Ark</em></strong> was entrusted to a group of scientists whose mission was to take capsules containing uncontaminated DNA to <strong><em>Terra Plane</em></strong>, a planet with an atmosphere and living conditions like Earth\u2019s. However, the mission did not go according to plan. \r\n  Witnessing such events, the aliens that created mankind decided that all of Earth\u2019s DNA belong to them and wanted it back. They intercepted the spaceship that the scientists were flying to <strong><em>Terra Plane</em></strong>. The scientists fought fearlessly against the aliens, unfortunately despite their valiant efforts they lost most of the capsules containing the non-contaminated DNA they were planning on taking to <strong><em>Terra Plane</em></strong>. Wanting to recover what they had lost the scientists decided to send someone after it. His name was Neil Stronge and his mission is to recover every single capsule that had been dispersed across the galaxy during the fight against the aliens, and to take them to <strong><em>Terra Plane</em></strong> to complete the original mission.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\r\nMOUSE\r\nOPTIONSARROW KEYSMOVEX\r\nSHOOTSPACEJUMP\r\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Encounter any bugs or bad grammar ? feel free to comments!\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sorry for my bad english.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T13:53:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d7453e3e27b941f50f818ac33829b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["BlackJack92k"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
