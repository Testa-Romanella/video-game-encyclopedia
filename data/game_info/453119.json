No. Oh. Well just imagine...</p>\n<p>It's the final pet dinghy, of the final end, of the Pet Dinghy Surfing championships Final. After a titanic struggle it all comes down to this. You need a single point to win but your opposition is currently leading the end. What do you do? Launch your dinghy at speed towards the target, knocking the rest out of play? Or do you try to glide one around the back that rests straight on the bullseye?\u00a0</p>\n<p>You suffer a flashback montage before deciding to go delicate. You slowly surf towards the release line, being very gentle with the power and curl. You release the dinghy and your pet surfs gracefully across the sea. The power seems perfect, here comes the curl... but you've not curled it enough, your dinghy glides out of play and you lose. Your team mates look at you in disgust. All you had to do was strike with power, but no, you're cleverer than that and you had to show off. You are a loser and inevitably will appear on sporting failures YouTube montage videos.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Pets on the Beach - Animal Dinghy Surfing</em>\u00a0is a one or two player game.
