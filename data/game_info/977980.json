You will have to solve two cases, where you will receive very few details about what happened. The objective is for you to be able to put together in your head what happened in the place, with as little detail as possible, so it will be important that you explore and make deductions, so that you can solve the cases and puzzles in the game.<h3>Build your destiny</h3>Being a detective is not an easy task. With each new case you decide to investigate, new people have their fates sealed in your hands. One word, one wrong accusation can mean the end of an innocent life.<br/><br/>In a Detective's Mind proposes an experience where your decisions matter, changing not only the destiny of the people around you, but yours as well.
