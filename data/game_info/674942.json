It took a friend and I about 4 weeks to make.\u00a0It runs in vbscript even though i know the language isn't meant for games. I plan on remaking the game with a proper game engine later on.\u00a0 To move you will have to type w, a, s, d, q, e 1, or 2\u00a0into the textbox (optionally\u00a0 3 and 4 as well on pc). Please let me know of any bugs/problems you encounter. Lastly i made a keymap for Touchmote to play this game with the wii remote (it's a lot more playable with it).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:54:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1bee5f826b1eddd989a135dc463d6604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lostBattery"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
