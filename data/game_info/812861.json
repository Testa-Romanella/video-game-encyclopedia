{"id": 812861, "slug": "oblique-strategies-gb", "name": "Oblique Strategies GB", "name_original": "Oblique Strategies GB", "description": "<p>Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards designed to help artists break up an art block. Each of the 100+ cards contain a possible action to take or a new way of thinking about a creative problem. They were created by artists Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in the 70s and have been updated with various new editions over the years.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This is a port of that deck of cards for Game Boy, for some reason.</strong><br/></p>\n<p> It was made by me, Nicky Flowers, as a way to learn how GB Studio works. Turns out it works pretty well! I boot up the ROM on my DMG when I get stuck working on music or coding or really anything where I'm creating stuff. I hope you might find it useful too! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Also available for download is a version for Analogue Pocket systems!! Wowee!!!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I was tempted to add a cool chiptune soundtrack but I found it to be distracting when I was working on something with audio. That'll just have to wait for my next homebrew software &gt;:)</p>\n<p>I'm not officially associated with Brian Eno or anything (that would be cool lol), but if you want the real thing, you can get it directly from him! I don't think my version has all the cards this 5th edition printing does. https://www.enoshop.co.uk/product/oblique-strategies?filter=Oblique%20Strategies<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bd8e8a7ad73709d5658ee3bba0e8d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicky Flowers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
