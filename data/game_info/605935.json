They\u2019ve been dubbed The Hyena by the press, thanks to the hideous cackle that sounds when each crime is through. The city\u2019s police are baffled, and the populace only grows more and more paranoid as the body count rises. Anyone could be next. Just ask Dick Brownstone, who mere moments ago woke up in the midst of one of The Hyena\u2019s fiendish traps. Now, he only has half an hour to figure out who the killer is. You see, Dick may not know it, but he and The Hyena go way back. And if he doesn\u2019t unmask the real culprit fast, the next bed he ends up in will be at the morgue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da6217b7e02c267e6c7a0f154e57bdb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alexander01allegheny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
