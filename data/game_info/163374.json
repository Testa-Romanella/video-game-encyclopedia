I hope to remind people of the depression that some people may experience. Your character wakes up in a dream state where their sanity is slowly draining. The only way to keep that sanity is to collect little pieces of light throughout the level. You must collect keys that unlock certain parts of your dream so you can advance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use A and D to move left and right and spacebar to jump. ESC key will bring up your cursor and backspace will remove it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The coding and level design was done solely by me.
