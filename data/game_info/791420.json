The goal for the Wobbles is that cheesy castle thing at the bottom right of the level. Note to self: draw something that better fits into the overall art style...<br/></p>\n<p>The red radar thingy in the middle? Grab it to move around the level, or use the cursor keys (or ASDW). (Known issue: Sometimes it won't let itself be grabbed, the cheeky little radar, tch... Just give it a bit, and try again.)</p>\n<p>Hold on the Radar until the countdown under the hand reaches ZERO (aka \"0\") to zoom to a random Wobble... You can also tap SPACE to jump to a random Wobble - that only works if you have a space bar.</p>\n<p>When you have an active Widget, you can erase one placed widget of the same kind if the widget available count == 0.</p>\n<p>Choose a widget at the bottom left with the mouse or the #s 1,2,3,4,5,etc... again, the #s only work if you have a keyboard. Neither my phone nor my\u00a0tablet has a keyboard, so kinda out of luck trying to use keys.</p>\n<p>I think that's about it, for now?</p>\n<p>Yeah.... that's all for now, folks!</p>\n<p>More soon!</p>\n<p>20220522</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T17:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fcabb8e3bf8595794d841aef7bda735c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["martinsstoller"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
