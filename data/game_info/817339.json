It's a 2D\u00a0side-scroller platformer that requires you to perform sacrifices along the way to progress.</p>\n<p>Run,\u00a0knock enemies out,\u00a0throw them in sacrificial pits,\u00a0\u00a0recruit new cultists, and more!</p><p>EDIT: I uploaded a patch that contains no additional content, but fixes an issue with some screen sizes.

The characters have to sacrifice creatures, objects, and even themselves in order to clear the path towards the summit.</p>\n<p>The limitation <strong>Failure is Inevitable </strong>is implemented both in the story of the game and the mechanics. At the end of every level, the cultist needs to sacrifice themselves to let the caravan progress, making you lose valuable recruits.</p>\n<p>This is a late submission: The game was made is 4 days instead of the usual 3. I wanted to finish my idea, despite knowing that I went a little overboard, so I ended up using an extra day to make the game stable, and add a few core mechanics\u00a0\u00a0and some content. This is the most effort I've ever made for a jam game - more than 30 hours of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The Cultists\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are four playable cultists.\u00a0Each of them have their own pros and cons. You can hire cultists if you have enough sorcery coins, but they are always random!</p>\n<p><strong>The Ordinary:\u00a0</strong>The green cultist has no special abilities. However, it's the easiest to play with, and the most reliable.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bouncy:</strong> The yellow cultist jumps high and can charge a super jump by holding the left click. However, they bounce around A LOT.</p>\n<p><strong>The Speedy:</strong> The red cultist is fast and nimble. Their special move makes they run wild, be careful!</p>\n<p><strong>The Frosty: </strong>The most powerful of all cultists, they can use their ice cold powers to freeze nearby enemies. However, using too much ice has left their feet a little... slippery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The Content\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The world hub has 3 levels.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You start at the first one. It's kinda a tutorial level.</li><li>The exit leads to the second level.</li><li>However, the tutorial level\u00a0has\u00a0a secret exit to a harder trial.</li><li>The trial is a gauntlet of challenges: each section is easier with a specific\u00a0 type of\u00a0cultist.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The Known Issues\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Enemies get stuck in walls sometimes.</li><li>Sometimes you double-bounce on fish when jumping on their tails</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>The Credits\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Gameplay, sounds, music, visuals, design, all assets\u00a0made by me, Conrado Clarke a.k.a \"Thinker\".
