There is no primary objective or goal to achieve, and instead of fulfilling objectives, the player is encouraged to make choices and engage fully in an interactive environment. Additionally the player is forced to view video lessons entering a classroom and learn while you move on with a simulated life.\u00a0The focus of the game is on the simulated lives of virtual people called \"Students\", and the player is responsible for directing their actions, attending to their needs, and helping them attain their desires. Players control their life and explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\"I am a Udemy instructor and also a developer, so I decided to make an\u00a0e-learning videogame for learning technology and fun for everyone at home who wants to learn\". - Juan Garcia\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The KN University Game (KN Learning) is a 3D emulation Game we are currently developing to learn technology from Vendors like Cisco, Microsoft, Avaya, Oracle in a fun 3D\u00a0video learning emulation.\u00a0On this series we are teaching the Networking University (Cisco Router and Switching Implementation laboratory) in a fun video Game for Learning.</p>\n<p>The KN University Game primarily make money by getting a job, or selling crafted items such as paintings and garden produce. Students need to develop skills for jobs and crafting items, for example, Students in the Networking Engineering\u00a0career track need to be proficient in the Routing skill. Players can place their Points in money items\u00a0or build their company using in-game building tools. Currently developing optional add-ons and expansion packs. This is a pre-developer release for students to learn Cisco Networking.
