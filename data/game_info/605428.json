And need to manage power of shoot. I draw many ideas, and decided to start with few of them, and add the other if i have time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What went well<br/></strong>Everything, until I packaged :D. I finished the first version in 2 days. I learned a lot by praticing, and I used Evans beginner tutorial to help me step up. As everything was well, I decided to add more features, and make my game more consistent, with a pause menu and a startup screen. I added more sounds and made it looks better<strong> </strong>over time. I also be abled to make my own mesh with blender. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong<br/></strong>I tested my game a lot during development, but I never thought that packaging was risky, that was a mistake. As every went well in editor mode of UE4, my packaged version didn't work as well. And as in editor no warning or error was catch it was complicated to know what was the problem. I did a lot of refacto, based on assumptions.</p>\n<p><strong>What I learned<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Test Packaged game, not in editor. Manage my time by making TODO list of what I want with priority. And only start a feature that you're sure to implement, instead fine-tune that already done.</p>\n<p><strong>ISSUES</strong></p>\n<p>it remains some issues that I will fix later :</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0HUD is displayed on startup screen</li><li>Go message and sound at begining of a game don't work </li><li>Day cycle doesn't work as intended, normally time's up would finished at evening.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Next Features</strong></p>\n<p>Will be added if I have time :<br/></p>\n<ul><li>options menu</li><li>easy mode</li><li>score points variation regarding time remaining, distance, and balloon's size</li><li>High Score billboard</li><li>Physics for Balloons</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T10:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/4003004f8e84270a5e6410ff2e97a35c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoganBlack"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
