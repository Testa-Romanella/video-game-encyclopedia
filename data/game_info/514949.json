It's a unique look, I can do it, and I think it will work.</p>\n<p>There isn't anything to play here, it's just a look at how the game might look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm still thinking through how to have the rocks wrap-around. It seems like what I\u00a0have works, works, works, fails and I'm not sure why. That's what prototypes are for! When the wrapping works, I like how it looks.</p>\n<p>The panel on the right will show what power-ups are active and other useful information. It also serves to make the gameplay area have a 4:3 aspect ratio. 16:9 seems too wide for a game like this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fb2efb16dc3b8504a2a99617e4c2672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eric - ATTTA dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
