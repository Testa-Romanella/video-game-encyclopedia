Worship the Thrones! Haggle for quests! Mend the tatters of Reality! Though the concept was developed for\u00a0<em>77 Vicious Princes</em> it is easily adapted to any system with a modicum of tweaking.</p>\n<p>This is <strong>still being playtested</strong>, so changes are likely incoming as it's brought to the table and refined. If you use it, please do let me know how it went and if you have any feedback for me to incorporate!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This is the PWYW version of the PDF. </strong>A (very inexpensive) one is forthcoming, which will contain additional art in all those blank spaces, and a specialized <em>dispatch</em> containing outcast mages, cursed torcs, musician-angels, and two extremely vicious princes. Hope to have that for you soon, and may the Subordinate Thrones guide your walks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa0cd42569b1a2f69c0e8d7876dd578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dukerino"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
