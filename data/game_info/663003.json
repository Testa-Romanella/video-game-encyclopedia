So I hope you enjoy :)</p>\n\n<p>You can watch the linked video (top right corner) to hear more on my process of making this recreation!</p>\n<p>https://superhotgame.com/\u00a0- Actual SUPERHOT</p>\n<p>https://jannikboysen.de/\u00a0- Shoutout to Jannik for helping me with the cover art/thumbnail</p>\n<p>My socials:</p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/GamesBySaul\u00a0- Find all of my links and socials here!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f13ab5ae2cdc1bd9065ffb17d5218a2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamesbySaul"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
