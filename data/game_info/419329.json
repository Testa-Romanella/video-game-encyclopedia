There are infantry, fortresses, tanks (Panzers), parachutists, and more.<br/><br/>There are 4 options (plus a random choice) for the French player (either human or AI):<br/>1. Dyle plan - the default (and historical) option, with the best allied armies poised to march through Belgium to counter the expected German attack.<br/>2. Escaut plan - same deployment as Dyle, only differs for the AI player, as this was a more cautious, limited advance into Belgium.<br/>3. No B.E.F. - hypothetical scenario where Britain is neutral.<br/>4. Reserves - the French 7th army was originally meant to be a strategic reserve, instead of the extreme left of the Allied line. This option puts it in reserve near Paris.<br/><br/>The German player has 5 options (plus the random one), again either human or AI:<br/>1. Manstein plan - the default option is the famous historical sickle cut through the Ardennes.<br/>2. Hadler plan - Original plan was a variant on the old Schlieffen plan only on a broad front in Belgium and Holland.<br/>3. Belgium plan - This was a concentrated thrust through Belgium, which would have met the Dyle plan head on.<br/>4. Compromise - Hitler proposed a compromise plan, which had a secondary thrust through the Ardennes, with the main effort in Belgium.<br/>5. A Strasburg hypothetical plan puts Panzergruppe Kleist, backed up by 7th Army reinforced with 3 infantry corps attacking South of Strasburg through the Maginot line!<br/><br/>Before you purchase this game, please try out the free game \"Wargame: Poland 1939\", to ensure your device works for these kind of games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:01:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5b1fc1483d256a346fa100ca2c55bbb_T65sH9i.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Kershaw"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Educational"], "publishers": ["David Kershaw"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
