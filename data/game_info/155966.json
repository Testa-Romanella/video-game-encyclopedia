Speedily place the clothes on the baby to earn points and take off the other mom's clothes that she put on the baby to replace it with yours, all under a time limit, because the baby certainly doesn't have enough patience for your shenanigans!<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by Julie Chu and Caroline Ouellette's baby dressing instagram posts.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e92841e6c515534588a35e25739ecf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mel"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
