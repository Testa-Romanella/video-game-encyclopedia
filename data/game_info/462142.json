Worse, what if the way you take an enemy's power is by shooting them with a different kind of gun? Even worse, what if taking an enemy's powers hurt you? Yeah that's this game. \"Why?\" you ask, because I can. Chain Together the 2 abilities to unlock a special combo that would've made sense if I had a day to make another enemy and ability.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Triple TriJam Game Jam where you had to make a game with 3 builds in 9 hours with the following themes: Chain Reaction, Negative Feedback Loop, and a Novel Twist on a Classic Game.</p>\n<p>Finally, Kirby with a gun, what else do you need to know.</p>\n<p><strong>CURRENT BUILD</strong></p>\n<p>This is the 2nd build.\u00a0It doesn't feel good yet, in the next 3 hours I plan to add particle effects, camera shake, and music, if I'm lucky I'll try sound effects for the first time. The art here is extremely rush but I like it cause it makes the game look even more chaotic which is the goal. I also haven't included any in-game control instructions but I'll add that later on.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\nINPUTACTIONA or Left Arrow<br/>Move LeftD or Right ArrowMove Right<br/>SpaceJumpLeft Mouse ButtonShoot Normal BulletRight Mouse ButtonShoot Power Stealing Bullet<br/>(Shoot an enemy with this<br/>type of bullet to take its<br/>abilities.
