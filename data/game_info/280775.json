A study* showed that such exercises could improve fluid intelligence ('the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge') by training with a 'demanding working memory task'. Whereas the stimuli in the study were auditory and visual, the stimuli for GO Hacker are both visual (squares and stones) and GO-focused.<br/><br/>Reported benefits of dual-n-back training include:<br/><br/>\t\u2022\tIncreased IQ<br/>\t\u2022\tIncreased fluid intelligence<br/>\t\u2022\tIncreased short-term memory performance<br/>\t\u2022\tDecreased distractibility<br/>\t\u2022\tReduced ADHD symptoms<br/>\t\u2022\tIncreased self-control and emotional stability<br/><br/>For GO, when GO Hacker skills have been mastered, this means that a player should be able to see many moves deep (keeping the position of stones in their working memory), stay focused and not let distractions (including emotional ones) sidetrack them during games. <br/><br/>*) http://www.pnas.org/content/105/19/6829.full", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2a6cd129e79f5721dcc5dd6d4e692bd.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/GO-Hacker-108807906326922/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mechanikus, UAB"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Mechanikus UAB"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
