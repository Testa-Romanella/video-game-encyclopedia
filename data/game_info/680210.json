You found an old journal of another anthropologist with notes about the alien's customs and culture. You will need that journal as you do not speak their language. The point of the game is to have conversations with the aliens and, through time, come to understand their language.</p>\n<p>*** The game is NOT polished, complete or even fun I'd daresay. I don't even really know if it's possible to understand the language with the given journal entries and deduction :b. It's a prototype, enjoy it as such. Maybe it would inspire your own creativity,\u00a0maybe you have propositions to make it better,\u00a0maybe you'd like to join to complete it\u00a0:)</p>\n\n<p>Good luck !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/622ed0f35b397b2bcf895dfbb0e34a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saledemon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
