PLAY IN FULLSCREEN MODE FOR BEST EXPIRIENCE!</p>\n<p>A\u00a02D maze like platformer where you have to get to the other side of the wall!\u00a0 AD or left and right arrow keys to move and Space bar to jump. R to reset and ESC to pause! Hope you enjoy this little side project I made for the GeoJam where you have to make a game in a week. I made this game in 4 days while I was bored at home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything is made by me including the Music, Art, Code, UI, Unity scenes and so on...</p>\n<p>There are 4 levels and they are quite hard to beat but give it a try! Once you've beaten the game try and beat it again but with a lower Death score!</p>\n<p>Have Fun!</p>\n<p>Game Music: (Made by me :) )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e29/e29ed6f96f8df0100406e6e8026e6a06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["usenowgamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
