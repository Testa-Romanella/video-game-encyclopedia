But humanity's soul has moved into the depths of rust, musk, and trash.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>This city folk tale is told by three people at the same time.</strong>\u00a0Everyone sees something different. Swears they saw the truth. The story is always changed by the teller.\r\n</p>\n<p>Who do you see?\r\n</p>\n<p>-----------\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a tiny demo created for the Haunted PS1 Game Jam and lasts for about 6 ripe minutes. Only one teller has stepped up to the bonfire for now.\u00a0The game should be completed by the end of November.\r\n</p>\n<p>For those of you who played the original, the full game will be drastically different. It starts out the same, but beyond that is the unknown. The demo is like tasting a familiar dish from a new cook.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unpack the\u00a0ZIP, go into the Build folder, and click the WhoISee Unity exe.\r\n</p>\n<p>-----------\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<p>-----------\r\n</p>\n<p>WAD - W to move forward, A and D to rotate. There is no going back.\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Talk with the Lovely Guests when prompted.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Click/Spacebar - Continue the conversation, even when they don't want to.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d28cc94ccb7dc6eef5fe2692ae0c096f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Dante Grimaldi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
