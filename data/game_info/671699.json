The <strong>L0GAN</strong>\u00a0 virus breached our codebase and simply redacted a bunch of important stuff!? The goal of [REDACTED] IS to be as scuffed as possible!</p>\n<p>=====================================================================</p><p>Sidenote:</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my game!\u00a0[REDACTED] is\u00a0a little passion project I did during my COVID break from school.\u00a0This was the first Unity game I developed which taught me\u00a0a lot of important things\u00a0through the whole development process.
