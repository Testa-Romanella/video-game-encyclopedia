It'll even impress the other Explorers (for better or for worse) and make you the talk of the town, for the first time ever!<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll encounter ferocious foes, navigate the world, and maybe uncover some secrets about the world around you and your place in it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Nah, of course you won't!
