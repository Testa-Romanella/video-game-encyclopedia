As she does, two of Gensokyo's more colorful citizens find her atop the peak, turning a personal moment into a fun activity to share. <br/></p>\n<p>Join in on the fun as you dodge trees, evade rocks, and pull sick jumps to the beat of Touhou-inspired drum-n-bass to get to the bottom first! With different endings for all three characters and several original tracks to listen to, we hope you will have fun judging this entry for Touhou Project Jam 10!</p>\n<p>[This game has multi-language support, offering Spanish and Portuguese translations.
