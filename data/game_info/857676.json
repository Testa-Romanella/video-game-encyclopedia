Move and aim, you don't even have to shoot! Choose a starting deity, gain experience and build your equipment. For you and your home. And yes, it looks like the game with vampires there... Or the one with lovecraftian monsters, or the one with living gun bullets, or the game with the crying baby... but well, here, we shoot pigeons. And you can kill your viewer with the Twitch integration !<br/><br/><br/><br/>Oh... How you hate pigeons... But they hate you even more. They came to kill you and shit on your house. You have 20 minutes to defeat this huge horde that is descending on your humble home.<br/>How do we do it? Ooooh... I so wanted you to ask me that question:<h3>The divinities are there to help you.</h3>You hate pigeons, so do the divinities. COOL! For every pigeon you defeat, your link with the deities increases with experience. And for each level you get to choose a new artifact for your equipment. You get rid of a pigeon, you're happy and you get stronger. Double win. And on top of that, each game is unique!<h3>Everyone has the right to choose how their life begins.</h3>The divinities are full of resources. It's up to you to choose your starting deity with its associated artifacts. But that's not all, you can get stronger and stronger permanently between games!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Are you, like, famous ?</h3>I think some pigeons know you and want to shit on your house. If you're on Twitch, the pigeons look strangely like your active viewers in the chat... Between us, you always wanted to \"pacify\" them, right?<h3>You are not safe anywhere</h3>Or are the pigeons not safe anywhere? Several locations are available with different challenges each time.<h3>Kill them, but kill them with style.</h3>I don't have more to say. It's up to you to choose your style, you'll be the last thing these evil pigeons will remember.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T04:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad821cab1ac322c9d52594a72cd550b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["The Moon Pirates"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Moon Pirates"], "esrb_rating": null}
