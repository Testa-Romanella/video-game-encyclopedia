It might be the only\u00a0<strong>2D isometric 5DOF shooter</strong>\u00a0around.

Well, it\u2019s due to\u00a0abyssal gigantism.<br/></p>\n<p>Please check README.TXT for controls! You might need a powerful computer unfortunately, as the optimization is kind of bad.\r\n</p>\n<p>Vertabyss is inspired by a previous Ludum Dare game of mine,\u00a0Vertico, but the gameplay is a lot different.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE: I may update this into a bigger game someday! That's why this is called (gamejam version). But I may put it off until I have rewritten my compiler.</p>\n\n<p>_\u2026..\u2014\u2013\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2013\u2026.._\u2026..\u2014\u2013\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2013\u2026.._\u2026..\u2014\u2013\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2013\u2026.._\u2026..\u2014\u2013\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2013</p>\n<p><em>SOME INFO ABOUT THE PROCESS: This was my first gamejam in five years. Part of the reason for that hiatus was because I was building a programming language! Vertabyss is the first game to ever use\u00a0<strong>Manta</strong>, a revolutionary programming language I spent years making. It would have been an advantage if it were further along, but ended up mostly being a handicap, since I spent about 75% percent of my time just improving the language. It\u2019s unoptimized, so I ended up having to write 25% of the code in Python (the language it currently compiles into) where performance mattered. But I\u2019m still quite pleased with the result!</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to keep tabs on my games or on the Manta programming language, please subscribe to my\u00a0newsletter\u00a0or follow my\u00a0Twitter!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T08:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548d3a0573fe785002a95335737a13f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["UltimateWalrus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
