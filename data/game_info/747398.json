It was in prison he met his mentor,\u00a0Jesiah Rann. He introduced Hoodunit to his now-wife, who has been his assistant in every show of his, even when he hit the big time.

He and Hoodunit are old friends and, even if they disagree on spirits, he is sure that Hoodunit would never betray him.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Rae Porter</strong>\u00a0- Not much is known about this Society Pages reporter. She had an easy, if not boring, childhood, with the only sour moment of her dog's death. She is also a massive royalty nut.
