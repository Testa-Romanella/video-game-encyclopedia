Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he\u2019d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky\u2019s Mammoth cave.  Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave.  He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nYears later, Don\u2019s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing the game, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game.  Her mind was filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant.  After finishing the game, and all 350 points achieved, she was ready for another adventure \u2013 a dilemma in 1979.  If it was another adventure she wanted, she\u2019d have to make her own!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, indeed she did.  In 1980 she designed and developed the world\u2019s first graphic computer game, Mystery House.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure game genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRelive the golden age of adventure gaming.
