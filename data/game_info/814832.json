I made this\u00a02~3 years ago, while getting familiar with Unity engine and C# language. The environment assets were made in Blender, or some of them are just Unity basic 3d primitives. Maybe this project worths getting some publicity  just for fun.<br/></p>\n<p>You can shoot enemies, collect ammo and health packages, and can be eaten by zombies or fall in the hot lava. By the way the game has also a story, and a very basic gameflow design about exploring, shooting enemies and solvig puzzles, but these features aren't implemented at all. Now all is about just killing zombies on a single map.<br/></p>\n<p>There are no sounds and music in the project, although I've already written the main and the high score scene themes in my head. <br/></p>\n<p>Default controls are: WASD + mouse + LMB/RMB.<br/>Tested only on PC, Windows 10. Doesn't need to install, just unzip and start.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like it, and you can imagine for example a story mode in this feeling, or have some kind of suggestions,\u00a0let me know! If you are hungry enough for braaainz, maybe I dig out again this forgotten project, and make it great... :D</p><p>Oh, and can you find the corrupt, mad scientist.. ?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Metal!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c672f011224752d305e13ca4ef79afa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ch4run"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
