Firstly I put together some assets I created previously, then, modified them to be fit to the style. I created new assets(model, rig, texture, animation) when needed and used some free environment assets(trees, mushrooms, swamp assets). Player Character animations are taken from Mixamo and edited accordingly. Some assets have been made in unity and animated. Programmed with C#, practiced 6 different design patterns.\u00a0 Still developing from time to time.
