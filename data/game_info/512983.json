Please download one of the versions below to experience this game at its best if you can.<br/></p>\n<p>Asteroidsds is a slight spin on the classic arcade game, starting out as a typical run-through until a certain turning point. After the turning point, you'll find that you can explore beyond the single screen the original was known for.</p>\n<p>A run-through when you know how the game works already takes about &lt;15 minutes. There is a speedrun timer running in the background that will show you your time at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Keyboard is highly recommended. Controller inputs are set up for xb360/xbOne controllers on windows, I cannot confirm if they'll work on anything else. A readme is available with controls and tips, and are labeled following this paragraph.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Up/W: Thrust</li><li>Down/S: Brakes</li><li>Left/A and Right/D: Turning</li><li>Space: Shoot</li><li>Escape: Pause</li><li>P: Self-destruct</li></ul>\n<p>Tips:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Light blue and Purple things are safe to touch, I wouldn't try it with anything else</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>My first game with unity, this was my opportunity to learn how some of the intricacies of the engine work; I hope to continue forward with this knowledge and learn more about game development and making more games.<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. If anyone happens to game on Mac or Linux, please leave a comment and tell me if the versions provided actually run.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T07:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7bfe7b3aaa713922f6c01e35977a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Shoelariat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
