{"id": 894950, "slug": "loco-card", "name": "Loco Card", "name_original": "Loco Card", "description": "<p>This is an entry to Deck-tember and was created using Internet Janitor's Decker.</p>\r\nLoco Card\r\n<p>Click <strong>Play</strong> and watch the train chug along! You can also\u00a0edit your\u00a0track and build a little town. There is no 'point' to the game, it's just a toy.</p>\n<p>You can play in full-screen mode to see it all bigger.</p><p>If you make a nice town, please share it! I'd love to see other creations.</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>HyperCard was before my time, and although I\u00a0love the concept,\u00a0I'm not totally sure what kinds of decks were out there. For inspiration,\u00a0I watched a video\u00a0(by Uri Kusterer)\u00a0proposing that HyperCard was \"<em>everything before everything</em>\" (1:25); meaning it was Xcode before Xcode, Scratch before Scratch,\u00a0the web before the web\u00a0and more before more. And, closest to my heart,\u00a0Flash before Flash.</p>\n<p>After a\u00a0look at some of the example stacks,\u00a0and I\u00a0was immediately drawn to <em>TrainSet</em>. I continue\u00a0Uri's motto by proposing that HyperCard\u00a0was also\u00a0<em>\"Lego Loco before Lego Loco</em>\". Lego Loco is an old game I spent far too long playing with my brothers. You create little Lego rail networks, and excitedly notice your town filling up with inhabitants as you do so.</p>\n<p>So: <em>Loco Card</em> is inspired by all these things. I\u00a0hope you enjoy playing with it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T10:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df891c100e3ce026b32d4e361295ee14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sunil."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
