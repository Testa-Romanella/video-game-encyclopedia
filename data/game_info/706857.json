The engine was adapted from Shady's Poopong: 20th Anniversary Edition, released on PC two years earlier.<br/></p>\n<p>The title and concept pokes fun at \"anniversary editions\" and other special releases and remasters of games, by referring to a non-milestone anniversary, as well as having way\u00a0<em>less</em> content than the previous game - not only was this title made mostly to test OUYA game development, but it was also released for free, as opposed to\u00a0<em>20th Anniversary Edition</em>, which was a commercial title.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, the game does feature modifications outside of shedding content. New to the game is an announcer, voiced by veteran vocal thespian Michael McConnohie. All of Shady's lines and the rest of the audio was also freshly re-recorded.\u00a0<em>22nd Anniversary Edition</em> also has some exclusive secrets to uncover.</p><p>A remastered version of\u00a0<em>22nd Anniversary Edition</em> is available on 10 Cent Classics: Shady Pack for PC and Mac.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7ea0351427f9a9694541ab5ceb7da088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["CC & SH"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
