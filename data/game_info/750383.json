Most maps from that time had strong layouts, but poor design decisions such as misaligned textures, bad texture choices, hidden doors and mandatory secrets to progress. The aim of this project is to fix those problems and take what was already strong about the original maps and improve it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T13:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/326d6b4737d4b931156298277200d956.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/1994tu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
