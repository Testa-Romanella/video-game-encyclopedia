It contains one short map, which can be gone through in around 10-20 minutes. The game is currently in development and I would appreciate any input and feedback.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The default controls are WSAD to move, SPACE to jump, LEFT SHIFT to wall jump when in air and close to a wall. Left mouse click shoots the grappling hook and right mouse click cancels it. You can press R to respawn at a save point, and P to show frames per second. The game is meant to be played at higher frame-rates (&gt;80fps), given the sharp low-poly environment.</p><p>The settings menu isn't done yet, and it's preferable to set your visual and control settings in the unity launcher. Currently only the 64-bit version is uploaded, I will upload a 32-bit version soon. I have a very poor computer and recording gameplay is quite difficult for me, so I'd definitely appreciate if someone made a short gameplay clip similar to mine - let me know if you do so.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45fc95d18648c1881adc1c20e1d91035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jpk1234"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
