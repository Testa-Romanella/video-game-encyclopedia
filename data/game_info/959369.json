The difficulty level increases as the player start playing from Level 1 to 3. The player's only motive should be saving from the chaser enemy and the straight/diagonal shooter. Players will enjoy seeing some cool planets, and asteroids, and hopefully will have a good time enjoying the music. In level 1, players only have to kill 7 enemies in order to win the level, whereas in levels 2 and 3 players have to destroy 10 of the enemies to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tried but failed: I wanted to work on the\u00a0menu like adding my own instructions on an empty page. Also,\u00a0I had trouble with zooming out while playing the game,\u00a0and I tried\u00a0to work on the main camera, when I start playing the game everything seems so zoomed in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<p>1) I created 3 different levels in which difficulty increases when the player goes level 1 to 2, and 3. The players could save themselves highest 3 times from the enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) I added some cool looks such as asteroids, and planets in order to have an aesthetic visual look for this game. I changed the music and created my own type of music from an app called GarageBand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) I added some abilities for the players such as fire rates, maximum lives, and a decent amount of speed. Also, I worked on the enemy's unique behavior such as their speed, following up the target, and good enough to make levels 2 and 3 really hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits: Unity, GarageBand</p>\n<p>Created by Md Towsif Sadab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T00:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f6b836d2b52a3729f4e4c5a5c7843c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["sadab_towsif"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
