It is named the Black and White Jam but any two colors are fair game so I wanted to use my favorite color combination, purple and yellow.</p>\n<p>The theme of this jam was Loop and I\u00a0really couldn't think of a mechanic relating to that theme\u00a0that was possible within my skill set or\u00a0the time I had. So the goal of the game is to collect literal loops in the form of cereal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All music is by Abstraction:\u00a0http://www.abstractionmusic.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:04:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed6be87186658ac939daa3f4d2329b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
