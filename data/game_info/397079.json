{"id": 397079, "slug": "picross-2", "name": "Picross 2", "name_original": "Picross 2", "description": "<p>Picross 2 is a Japan-only game for the Game Boy and the sequel to Mario&#39;s Picross and Mario&#39;s Super Picross; it was released in 1996. It keeps most of the same elements of its predecessor, as it deals with a grid and solving puzzles to form images. Both Mario and Wario return and each have different sets of puzzles to solve in the game, giving the player a variety in gameplay. This is one of the few games that can be fully enhanced by the Super Game Boy attachment for the Super Famicom, both allowing full color graphics as well as a two player mode; by performing any input on a second controller, a second player is entered in to the game, and players can then solve puzzles cooperatively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9a098b1748428044266885efb5132f.jpg", "website": "http://www.jupiter.co.jp/e/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy"], "developers": ["Jupiter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
