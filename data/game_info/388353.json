Slower, more intentional side-scrolling combat, with an emphasis on positioning and improvisation.  Taking cues from God Hand, your set of verbs (attack, block, dodge, eat, listen, talk, play the flute, teleport, kiss?) all come directly from your current set of items, and are changed out on the fly.  Design the perfect set of moves to approach any given encounter, then improvise like hell as a pivotal item is knocked from your hands and winds up blocked behind a rotting spider.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82bbf489c5dd449d205ce5a9597ae283.jpg", "website": "http://www.acidknife.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Powerhoof"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Powerhoof"], "esrb_rating": null}
