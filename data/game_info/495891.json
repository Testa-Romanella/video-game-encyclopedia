And a bit over a week too so can easily be casual about it and learn new stuff about the engine without really stressing out whether I can make something or not.</p><p>Sources can be found from the git repo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1dbe4446f7864e2c6baca238e9d5927b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
