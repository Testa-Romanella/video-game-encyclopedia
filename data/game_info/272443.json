From the classic tank shell gun turrets, to machine guns, to (guided) rocket options, and even lasers if that's more your thing. And if that isn't enough, there are a total of <strong>24</strong> different skins to choose from.Up to 8 playersTank Blazers allows for local multiplayer games for up to 8 players (up to 4 with split-screen).
