Meanwhile get ready for some reading.</p>\n<p>This is a work in progress (WIP), many things will change during the development process; currently the game can be described as a kinetic novel with decision prompts. There are choices that you can make to change how the story unfolds. Eventually I will be changing the game mechanics to make it a free-roam experience with repeatable events.</p>\n<p>This game is not a harem and you get to choose a single romance option, also it doesn't have extreme content, nor non-consensual content, and such things will not be added. This game is about deep connections between characters, romance, redemption, and traditional relationships. All\u00a0 with a lewd touch.</p>\n<p>I will be releasing content for my subscribers on a monthly basis, the first day of every month.</p>\n<p>Notice that this is not a Nukige ; don't expect to see tons of lewd content.</p>\n\r\nEpisode five (Prototype version 0.8.1).\r\n\r\nWhat is new in episode five?\r\n<p>Episode five v0.8.1 changelog:<br/>-Added a button to quickly access the stats screen.<br/>-Edited the stats screen to show only the girls we have met.<br/>-Implemented multiple decision prompts through out the game.<br/>-Adjusted events based on routes.<br/>-Story progression with Daria and Tiffany.<br/>-Lewd dream scene with Laura.<br/>-Included two animations for the lewd dream with Laura.<br/>-Spelling and grammar corrections.<br/>-Enabled a swipe gesture on Android to hide the textbox and enjoy the backgrounds.<br/>-Added music to the game!</p>\n\r\nPrototype versions:\r\n<p>The prototype version is an early build released for my monthly subscribers, it is the very last episode of my game, it may contain errors and it is possibly going to be edited. The prototype versions will be the bleeding edge of my game releases.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThe prototype version page will be gone after a month and a new prototype version page will take it's place; You will need to buy the new prototype version to play the very last episode.\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nPrototype version pricing:<p>The pricing will follow my subscribers plan; the price will be $10.00 the first day of the month when a new version is offered and it will be $5.00 fifteen days later, then it will be moved to a stable release for $1.00. I plan to update the demo version down the line to include new episodes and new features.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm releasing new content on a monthly basis, the first day of every month, my release model will be as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype =====&gt; Stable =====&gt; Free/Donation based.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Why the prototype version?</p>\n<p>There\u00a0are\u00a0some\u00a0people\u00a0who\u00a0want\u00a0to become monthly subscribers to get\u00a0the\u00a0very\u00a0last\u00a0episode, but they\u00a0can't\u00a0use \"SubscribeStar.Adult\" and \"Buy\u00a0Me\u00a0A\u00a0Coffee\" is giving\u00a0them\u00a0troubles.</p>\n<p>That motivated me to offer a prototype version of my game on Itch.io.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\n<ul><li>Extract and run\r\n</li><li> This game requires Webm codecs to play animation loops.</li><li>Windows user install this version.</li><li>MAC users install this one.</li><li>Linux use this one.</li><li>Android users don't need them.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T02:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff5ea3eeb3b33310fd7a84da89a2b7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["NineCrux"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
