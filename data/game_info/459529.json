Afterwards you have further 5 seconds to pick your action. Counter an attack with a shield. Stun your enemy to prevent his most severe attacks. And heal yourself when you have the time to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Game is a little more polished than its predecessor \"Galax-i\". However, I am not entirely satisfied with how the Look&amp;Feel turned out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Game has 7 room with rising difficulty. There is a hard mode available in the menu which prevents you from starting single rooms again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c05/c050156c0e9b7683c5e2c6d87339a6ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["p.dassler"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
