{"id": 980223, "slug": "mow-that-lawn", "name": "Mow That Lawn", "name_original": "Mow That Lawn", "description": "In this fast-paced and colorful side-scrolling platform shooter, you play as Thomas, who has gone to the garden to mow his lawn. Unfortunately, the lawn is full of holes and piles of dirt, which make it difficult to get the job done. The garden's wildlife also often gets in the way and as if that were\u2019nt enough, many of Thomas\u2019s old friends hang out in the garden and tease him as he drives around. Especially one old friend has grown tired of Thomas, so every time Thomas is out on the tractormower, he flyes drones over the garden and bombs Thomas with water balloons. Fortunately, Thomas has learned to jump over the holes, sitting on the tractormower, and he always has an unlimited number of soda cans with him, which he can throw at the various obstacles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay is inspired by the arcade games from the early 80\u2019s and the difficulty level is challenging as in these. Earn points by shooting everything around you and try to do well enough to achive a spot on the highscore list. The game takes place over a year, with one stage per month, grouped into the four seasons. Each season ends with a boss-fight. In autumn, the grass does not grow, but leaves must be swept on the adjacent residential road and in winter the entire area must be cleared of snow. Choose between 3 levels of difficulty: \"Easy\" for the beginner, \"Normal\", which is quite difficult - and \"Hard\", which is only recommended for the most experienced gardeners. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game fully supports game controllers, except if you achieve a spot on the highscore list. Then you must enter your name using the keyboard. The game can also be played with the keyboard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T07:49:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5ab9e7b6926ae4e4e4275c3098c82e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Suburban Codestew"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Suburban Codestew"], "esrb_rating": null}
