One day, his friend decides it&#39;s finally time to go outside. Unwillingly, Itzka&#39;s exposed to a beautiful fantasy land filled with adventures. After a terrible incident however, Itzka&#39;s forced to abandon his home forever and travel the world in search of the mightiest power imaginable - the Master Sword (yes, THE Master Sword). Because, you know, he&#39;s the Chosen One.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T03:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b97e42cc64311d31f2c0249a19721183.jpg", "website": "https://www.moddb.com/downloads/tales-of-itzkeria-full-updated-version", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
