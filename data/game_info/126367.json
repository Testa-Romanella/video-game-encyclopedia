{"id": 126367, "slug": "the-academy-jam-version", "name": "The Academy (Jam Version)", "name_original": "The Academy (Jam Version)", "description": "-- Overview --\r\n\n<p>Suckered into joining a controlling safe-compound based in an old academy, Ivy du\u00a0Froid lives a mildly frustrating, relatively boring life. And then one day, she discovers a\u00a0potential way out. Follow Ivy as she solves puzzles, fails at comforting people, and attempts to escape an empty existence where everyone's trying to reenact high school in the middle of a minor apocalypse.</p>\r\n-- Instructions --\r\n<p>Pressing the One (#1) Key on your keyboard accesses the menu. From here, you can inspect items or combine them (if prompted), save your progress, control options, and quit the game. In order to exit the menu, press the \"Exit Menu\" prompt.</p>\n<p><strong>-- IMPORTANT</strong>: Pressing the One (#1) Key again will not leave the menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-- TIP</strong>: If you cannot press it from the number pad, try the main keyboard. This game was developed on a Mac, so number pad commands may be strange.</p>\n<p>Move using the arrow keys. Press the shift key to sprint. Press enter to interact with objects or people.</p>\n<p>Because this is an adventure/puzzle game, it would benefit you to interact with everything in the environment.</p>\r\n-- Credits --\r\n<p>Plugins courtesy of Yanfly (http://yanfly.moe/), SumRndmDde (http://sumrndm.site/), Himeworks (http://himeworks.com/), Dan Deptula (RTP plugin), Orange Hudell (https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/orange-overlay.63524/), caethyril (https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/chase-event-stops-when-approach...), Mr. Trivel (https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/hide-item-quantities.59568/), orlando (RPG Maker Forums), and Eivind Teig (https://rpgmakermv.co/resources/keyboard-plugin.143/).</p>\n<p>Music made possible by Rafael Archangel of Free Music Archive.

I am not entirely satisfied with the writing or the puzzles, but I am happy with what I turned in. If you would like to see a full version with better story ideas and significantly more playtesting time, please leave a comment telling me so. I will update only if there are game breaking glitches, though I may release a Mac version at some point in the future.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a69d947fe864437698c69d767737889.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strung Up Starlight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
