It is recommended that you do not miss the following description:<br/>Klondike Solitaire uses a standard 52 card deck of playing cards without jokers. The objective of the game is to expose all cards and move them into the foundation piles. There are 4 foundation piles (one for each suit) that are represented on the screen by an \u201cA\u201c written on it. These piles are built upward in suit from Aces to Kings. <br/>In Solitaire there are 7 tableau columns that are built downward (in decreasing rank from Kings to Aces) in alternating colours (red and black). The aim of the game is to clear all the rows into the suitable foundation piles.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T04:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b9/0b94e9cb8a334d6c44832f03c6fc2d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["BIG CAKE APPS"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
