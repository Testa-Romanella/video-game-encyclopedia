It features dueling with random matchmaking, playing with friends, in game chat, and of course <strong>card trading between players</strong>. Every card is a Steam Inventory item, which can be traded and/or put on the marketplace. Players set their own rules - we will stay out of card trading as much as possible.<br/><br/>Collect souls to summon spirits, use your spirits to crush your opponents. Take their tomes both to gain power and to learn more about the story. The game is based in a world far away from our own - in another time. So far away that most of it's lore has been lost to time. Battle after battle, the secrets of the world will reveal themselves to you.GameplayEach player can create their own deck of up to 64 pages, or cards. Place your pages into a Tome, and your deck will be born. Each Tome has it's own unique ability. For example, the default tome card is Leech - which hurts the user by 1 HP every turn, but giving them 2 souls (for summoning cards) in exchange. Another is Mill, which allows summoners to eat away at their own deck for souls. Nothing gained or lost each turn, only what they choose to sacrifice from their own hand. <br/><br/>On a player's turn, he/she is able to summon cards, use magic cards, attack the other player's cards or the other player directly. Each player starts with 64 HP, so the goal is to get their HP to zero. With a wide variety of cards with their own unique abilities, the ways to go about it are endless. <br/><br/>The game features a sacrificial system, to summon powerful cards at the expensive of weaker cards (or alternatively - just summoning the stronger cards at a super high soul cost). There are status effects, such as poison, burn, freeze, etc. Overheal also is a big part of the game - healing beyond the normal limitations of a card's abilities.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e2387ea034c5b361b98e00462c955154.jpg", "website": "http://forgotten-lore.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 148}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coty Getzelman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coty Getzelman"], "esrb_rating": null}
