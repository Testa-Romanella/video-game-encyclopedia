The stories in these servers have created some really interesting lore, so I thought it was about time that these amazing stories became a bit more playable!</p>\n<p>Q: okay, but what's with the \"not-so-paper\" thing?<br/>A: this game was previously being developed under the title \"Paper RPZ\" and took heavy inspiration from the Paper Mario series. as development slowed down, I decided to tone down the scope of the game, turning it into a 2D game, focusing on the combat and story. when I went to name the project, I just typed the first thing that came to mind.</p>\n<p>Q: why does this game suck<br/>A: good question</p>\n<p>Q: why are there so many unused songs?<br/>A: hey, stop poking around in there and leave \"doink song.webm\" alone!<br/>You wouldn't want to...<br/>\"upset\" doink...<br/></p>\n<p>Q: which came first, the chicken or the egg?<br/>A: yes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d542784ce9e40864302b96f8b35fb4fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TaelsDaFoox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
