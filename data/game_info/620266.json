If you encounter any bugs or strange things don't be surprised and if you get stuck just press R to reset the current level.

You use the arrow keys to control both miners at the same time, their actions and movements are synchronized. Blast through dirt and rock using the mining laser. Be wary and alert while firing at dynamite as it will destroy materials and living things in its blast radius. Use the dynamite to your advantage to clear thick dark rock. Avoid Kobolds and hazards as you make reunite these lost miners!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Z to Fire</p>\n<p>R to Reset Level</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to Walk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/712117b050921b93d390d86f3bad14cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dungeon"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
