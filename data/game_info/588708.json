My goal was to create a more methodical approach to combat compared to\u00a0the typical bullet-hell style games, which are usually very chaotic and unpredictable.</p>\n<p>I made this game while bored in high school, so you should not expect that much of it. It has about 2h of play time, depending how well you do. Overall i think you could have a good time taking on the challenges, but i also spent so much time playtesting this that it might just be a form of stockholm syndrome.</p>\n<p>You can also find the source code here:\u00a0https://github.com/Sulicek/hidden_place</p>\n<p>Made using the Chili Framework:\u00a0https://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php/Chili_Framework</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d29bd2ddd7f72725c8d89b76886e24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sulicek"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
