I hope this is going to be the first of a bunch of games inside this little story i made up (borrowing some bits from Blame) So if you liked this, stay tuned for more!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7440c272ab2ed01d0779a7c46a7c638f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cranile"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
