True Crime: Streets of LA puts players in the role of LA cop Nick Kang on missions to take down major crime syndicates. True Crime recreates a 420 mile area of bustling Los Angeles California cityscape, where players will be able to freely roam, or take on missions that span from trendy Santa Monica to the gritty streets of Hollywood. City activity is similar to Rockstar&#39;s popular Grand Theft Auto series, allowing for &quot;police acquisition&quot; of civilian vehicles. True Crime also features deep &quot;bullet-time&quot; shootouts, and martial arts battles.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2003-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T23:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fb5/fb56b4a6c05031a1c3d4a9b4edcbfdcb.jpg", "website": "http://www.activision.com/microsite/truecrime/", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 50, "beaten": 113, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 36, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 100, "suggestions_count": 487, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 101, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "GameCube", "Xbox", "Classic Macintosh", "PC"], "developers": ["LTI Gray Matter", "Luxoflux"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Aspyr", "small", "(OS X)"], "esrb_rating": null}
