The objective\u00a0in this\u00a0optionally Co-op\u00a0highscore-based\u00a0\u00a0game is to get and sort as many cables as possible with the help of mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Problems that have come up so far;\u00a0</p><p>- Multiple people seem to have had problems\u00a0 figuring out what to do after sorting the first four cables. Ill have to make that clearer.</p><p>- There is a game breaking bug in there that stops new cables from spawning. However I have not been able to identify the cause. If you run into this bug,Id love to hear what exactly happened. It just seems to affect a single run, otherwise, reloading the page should fix it.</p><p>In case you have any ideas for improvements, please let me know!</p><p>-John</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T19:30:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/4281e42a599c92e19359f65053d15339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John_JH25"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
