Frankly, it's not very good. It also ends abruptly, so when the screen goes black and nothing happens, that means you've reached the end.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDEVELOPED BY FREE FOOD STUDIOS\r\n<p>Join our Discord Server</p>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter</p>\n<p>Subscribe to our Mailing List<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T17:21:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea050e2d17310c8c1b216bc394b459be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Free Food Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
