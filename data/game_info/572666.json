It was quite fun making it, and also nerve racking since I only had 2 minutes to make the main menu (^^;</p>\n<p>The theme was \"triangles\", so why not just make a game where you kill evil triangles? Sounds interesting enough O_o</p>\n<p>The controls and basic mechanics are displayed on the main menu, but basically you're supposed to kill triangles by shooting them and avoid them and their bullets at the same time. Kill a triangle and you will obtain score. You're also supposed to keep on jumping up the platforms, otherwise if you lag behind or hit at least one enemy or bullet, you die.</p>\n<p>Well, just play it. Hope you'll have fun ^_^</p><p>P.S: The HTML5 version of the game is very laggy. Download and play the Windows version for improved performance if you can!</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Art made by me using Pixelorama</p>\n<p>Font is \"Pixeled\" by OmegaPC777 and obtained from dafont.com</p>\n<p>Sounds obtained from Wowie Resource Pack (I couldnt't find\u00a0bfxr)</p>\n<p>Made with Godot 3.2.3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6e35bb956f7b20b6a9fa3d9724788da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kwago Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
