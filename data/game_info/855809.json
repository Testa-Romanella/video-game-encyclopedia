You play as a dwarf climbimng down a dangerous mine, mining gems and trying to find a big treasure. But as you take the treasure the water in the mine starts to rise and you have to make your way up the mine  in time to survive. The game lasts only around a minute, but the question remains: can you get outside the mine in time to safe your tresure? Its only a gamejam prototype with a few \"intended\" bugs, so you really have to be fast but have fun playing anyways ;D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55c8a69bef96477ba00d83ddc3d78506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrokoLee"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
