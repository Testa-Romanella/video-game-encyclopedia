You find yourself alone in an unfamiliar room with no memory of how you came to be there. Moonlight streams through a small barred window illuminating the musty stale air.

Solve puzzles and search for clues to discover the manor\u2019s secrets and ultimately escape from Darkmoor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc0ae8fbfd192328bfaa38ba40230d7d.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/escapedarkmoor?fref=ts", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inertia Game Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Inertia Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
