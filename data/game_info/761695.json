{"id": 761695, "slug": "dog-days-of-summer", "name": "Dog Days of Summer", "name_original": "Dog Days of Summer", "description": "<p>You're going to great things. Save lives. Help people. That's not going to make it any easier. All you have left are your friends and the dog days of summer.\u00a0The dog days of summer\u00a0last from July 3rd to August 11th in the Northern Hemisphere. You've got that much time to cheer up your friends before you have to leave.</p>\n<p>This is a short game about trying to pick the best time to tell your friends that you're leaving. Plan activities that your friends will like, navigating their schedules and the weather. It may be difficult to please everyone, but you're going to try.</p>\n<p>This is a mouse-driven game. Click on activities to play them on the highlighted day. \"Tell Them\" is a card you always have, and you can use it to inform the friends available that day that you're leaving. Something might happen if you tell them all before the end.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 50, \"Delay the Inevitable\". Fonts are Andika Basic,\u00a0 halogen by JHL Fonts, and Eagle Lake by Astigmatic. Instrument samples come from DSK Music, and sounds were provided by my very own mouth.</p>\n<p>I didn't get a chance to implement some things I really wanted. I think it would be nice to have an interstitial for each activity. To really drive a sense of story home. I probably could have made more cards. I ran up against the wall for getting some options in the game. Sorry if the sound balance is off! I usually make a volume control, but the deadline was fast approaching!</p>\n<p>One final note! I know the text is cut off in the letter at the beginning. That\u2019s on purpose! \ud83d\ude00<br/></p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by \"Dog Days are Over\" a song by Florence+the Machine.</p>\n<p><em>The dog days are over\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>The dog days are done\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>The horses are coming\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>So you better run\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>Leave all your love and your longing behind\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em><em>You can't carry it with you if you want to survive\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:33:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/5195d82d521f017e909f198471a1faca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
