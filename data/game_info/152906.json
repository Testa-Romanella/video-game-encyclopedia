In particular, the blocks moved in a discrete fashion down the screen, which allowed you to time your moves.</p>\n<p>This game is intended to look and feel similar to (how I remember) playing that game on the Model 100.</p>\n<p>Note: the \"spaceship\" is not part of the Model 100 character set, so I did cheat there.</p>\r\n\r\nSource\r\n<p>Source code is available here.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The font is adapted from Tom 7's\u00a0snoot.org pixel10.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d701709ee06d87c8e443633ef724fa1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["presidentbeef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
