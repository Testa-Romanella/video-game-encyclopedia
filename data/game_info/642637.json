Players play as a MULE commando who must shoot its way through five stages and destroy the Space Pirate hivemind.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong></p>\n<p>The demo consists of Stage 1 of the game. This project is still in active development. If you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please post about them in the forums below.</p><p><strong>Be sure to FOLLW ME or\u00a0ADD THE GAME TO AN ITCH COLLECTION so you can receive updates about the eventual full release.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Colonialism and crime plagued Irata for generations. But after a rogue Leggite toppled the Spheroid cartel, the planet began to heal. All creatures of the world rebuilt together.<br/></p>\n<p>Yet just as the Irata sun rose over a new day, an old terror returned from the skies: space pirates. The parasitic space pirates, always hungry for crystite, descended like a storm on the planet, darkening it with the whole of their wriggling, eldritch empire. Their larval spawn infested the wampus, the flapper, the gollumer, and every creature that dared breathe. All were folded into the dark legion from beyond the stars.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thousands died that first day. And thousands more in the days following.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The last bastion of survivors gathered together deep in the wart worm underground. In secret they built what would become their last hope, a MULE commando capable of fighting back and destroying the space pirates permanently.</p>\n<p>They called this final fateful mission: operation neMULEsis.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>This game features\u00a0<strong>five stages, multiple weapon pickups, an action-packed soundtrack, and more!</strong></p>\n<p>There are <strong>over</strong>\u00a0<strong>12\u00a0</strong>unique boss battles, multiple enemy types, and an entire alien world to explore and liberate. You are a cybernetically-engineered MULE soldier. You're the last hope that Irata has against the parasitic space pirates.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0* *\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0neMULEsis is\u00a0best played with a controller.\r\n</p>\n<p>Right/Left\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Move Right or\u00a0Left</p>\n<p>Up\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Aim Up</p>\n<p>Down\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Crouch</p>\n<p>Down + A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Drop through floor</p>\n<p>Start\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Begin Game /\u00a0 Pause\r\n</p>\n<p>B\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 Fire weapon</p>\n<p>A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Jump</p>\n<p>* *\u00a0*\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>neMULEsis</strong>\u00a0is the <strong>fifth\u00a0</strong>game in the MULEniverse series, which narratively extends the work of Danielle Bunten Berry's MULE economic simulator game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The MULEniverse games include:\r\n</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0Wampus\r\n</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Wart Worm Wingding\r\n</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Bat Lizard Bonanza\r\n</p>\n<p>4.

You can find one\u00a0here\u00a0or\u00a0here. You can also use any gamepad for a similar experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You can use either an\u00a0Everdrive, a\u00a0PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each has\u00a0<strong>mapper 30</strong>\u00a0support.\r\n</p>\n<p>*\u00a0*\u00a0*\r\n</p>\n<p>neMULEsis was made possible thanks to\u00a0NESMaker, a tool developed to make NES development more accessible.\r\n</p>\n<p>In order to play neMULEsis, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend MESEN. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper NESMaker uses for its games.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you have MESEN downloaded, start it up and\u00a0open the neMULEsis.nes ROM. The game should work fine.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>FOR MAC USERS:</strong>\u00a0Download\u00a0OpenEMU\u00a0for Mac. When you open the program, right click on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select \"Default Core.\"\u00a0Then select FCEU.\r\n</p>\n<p>* * *\r\n</p>\n<p>More from this developer:\u00a0https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e718b335eed1c09dff2eb60487731b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
