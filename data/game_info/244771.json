They just need to be saved from the little yellow creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI dunno... I like 3rd person action games so I made this. I'll do updates and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is basically capture the flag with pandas instead of flags, and they're randomly placed around the school so you have to run around looking for them, and every time you rescue one the enemies increase in number. You power up your weapon by defeating enough enemies like most 3rd person action games, and there's a high score mode where you get back any lost lives every time you rescue enough pandas. It's only like 5 minutes long. I'll just keep adding stuff to it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c3bb061e2025185c5bb147da495c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LT"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LT"], "esrb_rating": null}
