Well, it's a <em>fact</em> that behind every game of Tetris, there's a tiny pixie choosing which pieces to send to which players. Usually, these pixies are benevolent, trying to give players exactly what they need. Today..... <em>you</em> are that pixie.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions</p>\n<p>-Click and drag pieces to send them to each player</p>\n<p>-The players will try and decide the best place to put the pieces themselves</p>\n<p>-Try and help all players get the best score they can! If one loses, they all lose!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>More:</p><p>-Each player can only drop one piece at a time<br/></p>\n<p>-The same piece cannot be sent to the same player twice in a row</p>\n<p>-If a player does not receive a piece, they will be given garbage lines</p>\n<p>-Where is this going in the future? \u00a0Well, it could be local coop with real players.
