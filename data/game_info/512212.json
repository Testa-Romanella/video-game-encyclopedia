This was just a quick college assignment made in a day to create an Infinite Runner game on Construct 2. All assets used are from Kenney Game Assets.</p><p>Currently there is a bug where the first time you start the game, you need to tap again for the player to start running and for the score to start counting. This is a conflict with the touch and keyboard controls, I'll fix it in the near future. I will implement the animations for the player in the pack as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/3743f308cfff17f2bba7bcd3fe77112a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Luna Witcher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
