Click anywhere to spawn magnets and use them to crash flies. Magnet force will take care of the rest. <br/><br/>The game has some bugs and doesn't really look good, but at least this was my first unity game and a game jam submission! I hope you will enjoy it for a minute or so.<br/><br/>Later in the development, I realized that using a grid system would've been much better, but it was way too late. Sorry for janky Unity physics!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/768a3771a21a3c04296e914ff9c2654e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nekiwo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
