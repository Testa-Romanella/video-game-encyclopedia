The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p>\r\nGame Description\r\n<p><strong>Local multiplayer alternative controller football game</strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Leith Ben Abdessalem\u00a0https://www.leithba.com/</p>\r\nSupervision\r\n<p>This game was during the Game A Week workshop, organized and supervised by:\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/1828a2e55bb6bf7a013bc2b7eeb89cf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeithBA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
