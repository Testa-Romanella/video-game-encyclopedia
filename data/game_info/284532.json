There are 115 quattuorvigintillion possible map layouts (that's 1077),\u00a0 so\u00a0 you'll always have new rooms to explore, monsters to fight, and loot to earn!</p>\r\nAlpha Release\r\n<p>During the early alpha, the game will be free to download and play. After the Alpha stage of the game is completed, the final alpha release will become a free demo, and the game will enter a paid beta to full release. I'm shooting for an asking price of $10 post-alpha, and plan on continuing to update and improve the game to make it a game people want to play.</p>\r\nDevelopment Progress?\r\n<p>If you're interested in the project's development status and what I'm currently working on, I spam all my development info on my website here. There I regularly post about what I've been working on, and it also serves as an archive of my work progress.</p>\r\nImportant!\r\n<p>The game is in extremely early alpha, probably with a few bugs. It's gonna take time work out the bugs.<br/><br/>The game is basically only playable in 1080p right now, as the UI is not fully finished, and I do all my testing at 1080p<br/><br/>Feel free to leave comments about the game below!</p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>Windows Vista/7/8/10 and .NET Framework<br/>Keyboard and Mouse<br/>4GB RAM<br/>nVidia GTX 650 Equivalent or better.<br/>1920x1080 resolution support<br/> (more resolutions will be added later)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba6a290d9c89bb5ac31e887a5f3ff563.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Asperity Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
