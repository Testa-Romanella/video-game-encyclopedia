{"id": 909941, "slug": "monthly-dystopia", "name": "Monthly Dystopia", "name_original": "Monthly Dystopia", "description": "A dystopian survival experience inspired by George Orwell's 1984.<br/><br/>In Monthly Dystopia, you need to find a way to survive in an authoritarian world. You can serve the dictatorship by being a model citizen or you can try to flee the country by cooperating with the Resistance. You live under a regime in which love is forbidden and using words banned by the Party is punishable by death. Choose your words wisely if you don't want to commit a thought crime. Remember, there's always a screen watching you. The paycheck from your job at the ministry editing the past is barely enough to buy the food needed to keep you alive, so it is crucial that you find a way to flee this dystopia where even thinking is forbidden.<br/><br/>You can serve as a loyal citizen, fall in love and constantly fear getting caught, work with the Resistance against the dictatorship, and choose freedom or servitude.<br/><br/>The daily tasks you perform in your apartment are your only way to survive. Remember that your time is just as limited as your supplies. You'll have to choose between cooking before going to work, taking medication for your illness, or doing activities that benefit your mental state. You can try to protect the people around you by making conscientious decisions or you can escape this dystopia by sacrificing them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T06:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2c68deb6faf588397ed37278aff9fb.jpg", "website": "http://hermesgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fatih Beceren"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Fatih Beceren"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
