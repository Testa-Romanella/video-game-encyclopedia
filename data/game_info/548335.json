Are you gonna cry, hide, or crawl into a corner as you slowly realize that you have no meaning in this world and that no matter what you do you and everyone you know and love will\u00a0inevitably die and be forgotten while the people of the world slowly destroy their own planet? No way! Because your a CONFLICT SWINE, and CONFLICT SWINE don't\u00a0cry, hide, or\u00a0crawl into a corner as they slowly realize that they have no meaning! Well, actually they do all those things a lot, but not today! So hop on your overpriced sports car, pay your rent, and get down to the Hand's evil lair fortress thing!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the BTP Game Jam #3.
