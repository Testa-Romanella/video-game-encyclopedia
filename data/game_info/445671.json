It runs better if you download the rar file.</p>\n\n<p>The game has a very short gameplay time of somewhere around 20-30 minutes. You might dig this game if you are into the indie genre. This is more of a psychological walking simulator than a game. More like an experience you can say. The player has nothing much to do. The plot goes something like this, A person one day discovers himself that he is inside a glitch. And the higher entity that possesses the power over him decides to show him a little glimpse of his true identity and so breaks the fourth wall to contact with him. Don't try to find any meaning in this game. Because it has none. This game was heavily inspired by the indie game \"When the darkness Comes\". Anyway do play the game if you dig the concept and it would be nice to hear from you guys about which ending did you got.</p>\n\n<p>This game occasionally uses the button \"E\" to interact when it is needed.</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D is used for general movements.</p>\n<p>Tip: If you are stuck somewhere in the game,be sure to explore every inch of the game. And remember, Patience is the key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/cae0af9fb98760f280c9ed6fcf7188d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hasi-b"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
