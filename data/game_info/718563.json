WishBone is my first game, and is very much a tech demo/experimental game. The project was created with GBStudio, a\u00a0 fan made\u00a0studio application that renders projects for the gameboy\u00a0game system, and Pixen,\u00a0a professional pixel art editor designed for projects that try to achieve a design from\u00a0old-school video games. Most of the skills I obtained to make this project were learned on YouTube from this playlist.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:<br/></strong>The game is a very\u00a0linear story based game driven\u00a0mostly dialogue and world\u00a0art.
