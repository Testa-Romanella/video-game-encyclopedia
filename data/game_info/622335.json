Space is a dangerous place, but if you're brave enough, and smart enough, then there's riches to be had among the stars. Each new system has untapped potential just waiting for you, but you'll need to beef up your ship and fight for it if you want the real mother lode. Good luck kid, you're gonna need it.</p>\n\n<p>_______________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>On a more casual note, Leap Space is my first game and the culmination of about 8 months of consistent work and improvement! It began as a group project in a game design class I was taking while unemployed during the pandemic, and I had so much fun with it that I continued developing it afterwards. If you've found your way here, I hope you enjoy the game and I would love to get your feedback if you have any. I don't know if I will ever make another game, but if I do I want to be able to improve every time!</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in the source code, here is the GitHub project:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Wendlijl/LSMobileLite<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T02:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30cc0ee9d1da5ce1d536cdaa5a5a8190.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Jman2150"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
