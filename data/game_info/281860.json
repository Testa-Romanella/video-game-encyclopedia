{"id": 281860, "slug": "off-world-interceptor", "name": "Off-World Interceptor", "name_original": "Off-World Interceptor", "description": "<p>In a dystopian future, off-world bounty hunters called &quot;trashmen&quot; are given weaponized vehicles with boost packs by the military government to chase after mercenaries, criminals and other enemies off-road until they blow up their vehicles. Every level has a boss fight at the end. If the player fails to kill the opponents in given time, the game is over. The game features cheesy full motion video sequences, however, they are riffed the whole time by two &quot;couch potatoes&quot; in the shadows in the very same style as Mystery Science Theater 3000.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-16T11:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a63ff7e7497dd7bf84d61dc8f712f8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["3DO", "PlayStation", "SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["Crystal Dynamics"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Crystal Dynamics"], "esrb_rating": null}
