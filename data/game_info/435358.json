There are instruction modals in the game, but just in case:</p>\n<p>Gameplay is split into two phases. In the overworld, you must choose a castle to travel to from your current castle (which will have a blue marker around it). Once you\u2019ve chosen a castle, a red marker will appear underneath it. You can then travel by clicking the \u201ctravel\u201d button in the left-hand pane.</p>\n<p>Travelling takes 1 day. You have to survive for 14 days.</p>\n<p>While travelling, you enter the other phase of the game. You are underground and must choose a route through a sequence of cards which will affect your status and the status of the tunnel you\u2019re in. You choose from the top row of cards, again using the mouse. Depending on your last choice of card, between 2 and 3 of this top row will be selectable. Cards not adjacent to your previous position will not be selectable.</p>\n<p>The goal overall is to keep the network of tunnels healthy and also not die yourself. At the end of every turn, the network will suffer random damage which it is your job to repair.</p>\n<p><strong>This game was created for Ludum Dare 46 (compo)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d847dc66cf0f6ddbcf45e0ab79adc73d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MisterKeefe"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
