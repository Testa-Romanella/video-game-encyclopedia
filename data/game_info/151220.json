To stop the keyboard, you must press the right buttons. How do you know what button is the right one? Well, the keyboard puts cryptic hints on the screen.<br/><br/>Keyboards are weird like that.<br/></p><p>But be careful! Every time you press a key, your health goes down a little bit. After 100 key presses, it's game over!<br/></p><p>This is a very early concept piece. Everything here (Yes, even the awful art) is a place holder for a hopefully better game. All I ask is for you to give it a spin and leave some feedback! Anything, from saying you don't like the color green to how this is a piece of garbage, helps me immensely!</p><p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e637e20a4b70bae6a725bab4dd541419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HautDeForme"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
