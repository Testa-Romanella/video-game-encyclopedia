Only you can help humanity survive by leading your band of survivors on a path to redemption. Starting with a lost bunch of survivors, you need to scavange resources, rediscover technology and maintain the peace between differing factions as you strive to rebuild society.<br />\nExplore and Exploit<br />\nThe world - as you know it - has gone, replaced by islands, swamps and isolated groups of survivors. Gathering scarce resources, you need to explore the world - island by island - helping those you can and dealing with those who do not share your vision of the future.<br />\nGrow Your Colony<br />\nThere&#39;s more to a city than just people. Food, shelter, water, health, security - the list is long and varied. Technology to be researched along a branching Tech-Tree, buildings upgraded and specialists to train. It&#39;s down to you to make sure all these needs are fulfilled; a job made all the harder with limited resources, space and labour to complete these tasks.<br />\nYou Are the Law<br />\nA society is only as good as its laws; it&#39;s up to you to define them. Will you usher in a new utopian age of equality or is your future a benign dictatorship? Not every group shares your vision and the choices you make can have a profound impact on the future of your settlement. A common goal will make your society more productive than one at loggerheads with itself; you need to define and choose your legal evolution and which route to follow on the Law-Tree but - as with all things - there are always consequences.<br />\nUnlimited Playthroughs<br />\nEach game is different; maps, events and make up of the world are randomly generated, allowing unique playthroughs every time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T14:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a44/a446c48e4a0ffbb0e2c2624e7c063bae.jpg", "website": "https://vilemonarch.com/floodland/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 22, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 5, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vile Monarch"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Ravenscourt"], "esrb_rating": null}
