{"id": 541644, "slug": "gods-of-maa-pristine-sin", "name": "Gods of Maa - Pristine Sin", "name_original": "Gods of Maa - Pristine Sin", "description": "<p>Gods of Maa is a passion project of mine that I've been honing for years, and it was fully realized for the first time in 2014 in the form of the first game Pristine Sin. The game got expanded into a full trilogy with its later installments Corrupted Blessing in 2015 and Mechanical Prayer in 2016, and the three games grew together in various aspects thorough the next few years (like getting a full graphical remake and various new songs), and the series reached a satisfying final result in 2020.<br/></p>\n<p>These games are one-man-made (apart from the musics, which are from various sources), made with Ren'Py and completely free.<br/></p>\n<p>The first game, Pristine Sin here, tells a story about Blake, a rebel hell-bent on vengeance, who finds a gentle amnesia-suffering demon named Eddo from a desert. Later the two are accompanied by a quirky girl Suki who is a fellow rebel, and the three of them end up on a quest to find five beings called angels, before the empire of Circinus find them to exploit their powers to conquer the world.</p>\n<p>The trilogy's genre falls somewhere between fantasy and steampunk, with story philosophical elements that may or may not destroy your emotions, and a plethora of interesting, hilarious and down-right depressing characters.</p>\n<p>Depending on how fast reader you are, each game will offer you 6 to 8 hours of story.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to play this one first before the other two games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572a28949fa905c5ff6e32ac63dc7a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pyllymursu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
