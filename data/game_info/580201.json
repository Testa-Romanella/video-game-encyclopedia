It begins when the sun rises and ends when it sets. You can affect the speed at which the day progresses by successfully catching multiple prey in a row, meaning that a skilled player can finish a run in only a few minutes.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>After a successful run you get a score based on how much prey you caught, the damage you took, and whether you broke any combos.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>You control the shrimp with WASD or the arrow keys, and eat with the spacebar.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Shrimp Out of Water was written in c++ utilizing SDL. All sounds were either taken from OpenGameArt.org or made with Bfxr.</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/9816694842990de513624e39bb26d626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["An Optimistic Beetle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
