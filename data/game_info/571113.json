{"id": 571113, "slug": "world-war-cthulhu", "name": "World War Cthulhu", "name_original": "World War Cthulhu", "description": "<p>Squad Level, Tactical, Realtime, RPG with optional Coop. Mixing Genres of Cthulhu, 40k and WW1 History. An idea derived from a couple of pen &amp; paper sessions with friends. For discussion join: https://discord.gg/cJgqgGAWWG<br/></p>\n<p>Basic Mechanics:<br/>Command a squad of 4 fireteams. You (the squad leader) can order the individual fireteams to move and they will react to enemies and act according to their behaviour settings, like: defensive, taking cover before engaging or more aggressive and assault the move point. Squad Members will actively propagate orders to everyone in range.\u00a0<br/>As a coop game, individual fireteams can be controlled by teammates.<br/></p>\n<p>In Development:<br/>Basically all visuals are mockups (thanks to u/GreenTampleTheOne for the nice weapon infographics)<br/> Expect things not to work as expected ;)<br/>After the most basic combat works, more mystical/psychic powers will be implemented (like Psyker and such) as well as a more in depth psychological system to reflect the traumatic events your squad has to endure.<br/>In the long run, there will be some sort of campaign.<br/>There is a lot to learn and so far its great fun, but its a long road...<br/></p>\n<p>Introduction/Fluff Text:<br/>1915. The World is in a grim state of war. The bloodletting between the nations is used by cultists to summon some powerful deities from another plane of existence.<br/>The governments of the nations are corrupted and influenced by mysterious forces and there are only few who know the secret of the dark plan. Radically improvement of propaganda techniques are used to increase the will to fight on, to increase the human suffering, thus making the sacrifice to their gods more valuable. The more violent, the more it pleases these gods.<br/>But even the propaganda doesnt hide the fact, that reports from strange happening at the front, where creatures not from this world are emerging and people are more and more going insane, are coming back with the wounded or soldiers on relief. Those who are trying to interrupt the rituals, are helpless in stopping the waring nations from butchering themself,<br/>but are connected internationally and working together to overcome the cult or at least impede their plans. It seems that rifts to a parallel or different dimension are opening and the most vile creatures are emerging.<br/>Those need to be closed or the situation could lead to a far worse fate, than the nations beeing in a war of attrition, senslessly bruting each other. The corruption could consume the whole world and end life on the planet as we know it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d1/9d1ea7120fa7e65ea2281f8d32c1191e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PseudotsugaMensk"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
