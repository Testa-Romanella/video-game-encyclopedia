This is a work in progress, but I think the foundation is here; I could design the three levels very quickly (in a matter of dozens of minutes) once I was finished with the heavy groundwork.<br/><strong>WARNING:</strong> may (entirely) contain fine egregious <em>programmer art</em> design. Viewer discretion is advised. <em>(Actually, I have asked some people, and it turns out they did not think the game to be ugly. I don\u2019t either, to be frank, I think it is <strong>cute</strong>. :))</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>Animations are also not yet implemented; take it as a homage to <em>Civilization II</em>.</p>\r\nCreation context<br/>\n<p><em>Made for</em> <em>Mini Jam 109 with theme <strong>\u2018Depth(s)\u2019</strong> and limitation <strong>\u2018Health Is A Tool\u2019</strong>.\r\n (Running time: from June 24th 2022 at 6:00 AM to June 27th 2022 at 6:00 AM.)<br/><br/></em><em><strong>Epilogue:</strong> unfortunately, the prototype was ready at the last minute before the end of the\u2026 votes. The game is thus not marked and stays unranked. I would be interested in your <strong>feedback</strong>, though, so you can leave a message over there, or even how you would have marked the game (considering the three levels from the first version) if you had had your say over the matter. I was very disappointed to have missed this opportunity by only some days, in my second Game Jam\u2026<br/>Anyway, I am happy with what I have achieved; this may turn into a complete game. I like how it looks (especially the submarine feel associated with the permanent distorsion), how it should play after some gauge parameter tweakings, and it was also the occasion of reusing some programming experience from </em>La Faim d\u2019Elvis<em> and extend it (especially collisions). :) And this one may in turn be useful for a part of a greater project of mine (which should be called </em>Terminal<em>, in case you are curious).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/94215dda5f9e632ff205d7ceeb88b3b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mossieur Patate"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
