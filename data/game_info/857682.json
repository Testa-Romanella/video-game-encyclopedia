We are a small team of non-football fans, and this is our vision for the future.<h3>The World's Most Unrealistic Football Simulator</h3>Enjoy our free interpretation of 3D physics simulation and procedural footwork. No other football game has bouncing sliding tackles or tripping over landmines quite like ours.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Football Micro Manager</h3>You are in full control of your entire team! Where they are, what they do - It's all on you! Position, kick and use non-regulatory Coach abilities to outplay your opponent.<h3>Fair Fear Play</h3>Football players in A Bad Game of Football come with their own personal health bar. Play dirty to battle the ball into the net.<h3>\"It's Not The Goals You Remember.\"</h3>\"It's the bruised legs and cracked skulls you meet on the way.\" That's what my dad used to say, anyways. I just recently understood what he meant about it. This game is probably about my childhood.<h3>What to expect:</h3><br/><strong>During the Early Access:</strong><br/><ul><li>Explosive RTS ballplay<br/></li><li>3 playable arenas<br/></li><li>3 playable coaches<br/></li><li>A fourth arena and coach, leading up to the Qatar World Championship<br/></li><li>Online play (public and private)<br/></li><li>LAN mode, for when the apocalypse hits<br/></li><li>Offline training mode (not in itself worth a purchase - just to let you get acquainted with the controls in a safe environment)<br/></li><li>Contact with our lovely developers via our Discord</li></ul><br/><strong>In the Full game:</strong><br/><ul><li>The best bad Real Time football game the world has ever seen<br/></li><li>4 unique arenas (with more to come)<br/></li><li>6 unique coaches (with more to come)<br/></li><li>A life time of free updates!*</li></ul><h3>What not to expect:</h3><ul><li>Single player<br/></li><li>Realism<br/></li><li>Historical accuracy<br/></li><li>Attempts at hiding human rights violations<br/></li><li>Other official football stuff</li></ul><br/>*That's product life time (not human life time).
