These blocks will increase or decrease excitement point.</li><li>You can pick, rotate, and swap the piece of property in your hand with another in the conveyor.</li><li>There are 11 kinds of properties with their respective excitement point. Any properties put in the city may affect city's excitement point.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>When the land provided is getting too crowded, a button will appear on the bottom. Press this to start building on a new plot of land, with the excitement score of that land carried over.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Each city has their own excitement value as you can see on the bottom. Make sure this never reaches zero or below!</li><li>Also make sure that the difference between the two excitements never reaches above 140 or else the citizens will protest and game over!</li><li>Don't forget to use all the blocks on the conveyor. If its too full the citizens will also protest and game over!</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Bonaventura Galang K. A.
