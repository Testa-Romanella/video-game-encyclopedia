Despite a lengthy search and rescue operation by NATO coalition forces, the vessel was never discovered.</p>\n<p>6 weeks after the vessel disappeared, all crew aboard the\u00a0<em>Tigershark</em> were declared MIA. The disappearance was chalked up to a massive systems failure.</p>\n<p>Four days ago, the\u00a0<em>Tigershark</em> resurfaced, breaking through ice\u00a0near an Arctic research station. You plan to\u00a0to board the\u00a0<em>Tigershark</em>, and try to determine the fate of the crew.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Ran out of time towards the end of this project! Lots of stuff planned, but only had enough time to put together this short experience.\u00a0Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924dcc29d808e6c6386decc0c1363b1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["awhiskin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
