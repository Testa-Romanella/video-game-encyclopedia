The debut title of Sacnoth, the game was published by SNK in Japan in 1999 and by Infogrames overseas in 2000. Set in the haunted Nemeton Monastery in Wales, the game follows protagonists Koudelka Iasant, Edward Plunkett and Bishop James O&#39;Flaherty as they uncover Nemeton&#39;s secrets and confront monsters created from its dark past. Gameplay blends exploration and puzzle elements from survival horror with turn-based battles played out on a grid.<br />\nKoudelka was the creation of Hiroki Kikuta, a former employee of Square who formed Sacnoth with former Square staff members in 1998 to develop the game. Kikuta served as director, producer, writer and composer. To create an authentic atmosphere, the staff went on research trips to Wales and all dialogue was performed in English. The traditional turn-based battle system was created without Kikuta&#39;s involvement due to staff disputes. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics. Koudelka would form the foundation for Sacnoth&#39;s Shadow Hearts series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T14:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/946/946f472801b22b276ce6a6cbd896db26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.14, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 13, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 12, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 834, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sacnoth"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["SNK"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
