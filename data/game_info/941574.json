With the threat of Funfrock eliminated, Twinsen lives happily with Zoe on Citadel Island. But a threat from elsewhere appears...<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nEquipped with a mysterious tunic and a magic ball, Twinsen embarks on an incredible journey to another planet: Zeelich.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nTravel from planet to planet, meet memorable characters, solve puzzles and prevent the Twinsun invasion!<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIncredible art direction<br/>\nUnder the direction of Paulo Torinno, the new art director of the Twinsen series, Twinsen's Little Big Adventure 2 - Remastered invites you to experience Twinsun and Zeelich in a whole new light. With new animations, an updated camera and 4K resolution, the world of the series takes on a whole new dimension.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHD Music<br/>\nThanks to the talented Philippe Vachey, the game's soundtrack instantly became cult. 30 years later, it deserves an HD version to re-enchant players.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nUpdated controls<br/>\nAnalog controls offer more subtle control of Twinsen. New abilities such as dodging and the ability to switch weapons instantly open up new avenues for speedruns. Optional 'Old School' keyboard controls are also available, so Little Big Adventure purists can play without losing their bearings.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T08:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49d/49d24546620121425c8ada3befc765d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[2.21]"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["[2.21]"], "esrb_rating": null}
