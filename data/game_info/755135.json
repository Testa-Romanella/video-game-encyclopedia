I\u00a0do not know what the final product looks like. It's 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels tall, and with 638 pixels, it will take about just short of twenty months to complete. One pixel a day, one day at a time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is how we get better.</p>\n<p>If you are particularly clever, you can find a way to cheat the image out. I won't stop you, I just encourage you not to ruin the fun for everybody else.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an anonymous friend of mine for giving me a crash course in JS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T05:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/83562a6b9a15e7a71d458cb80e3cde3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["s1lv3r dr4g0n"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
