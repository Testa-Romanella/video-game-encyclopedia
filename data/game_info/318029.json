While some focus on mechanics, I love to write stories and believe in stories in gaming. So, I decided to make a visual novel, or so I thought. This was a major learning experience for me. I learned that I need to hire artist and others to help make this story what I envision. Currently, I am using art I have found online and have credited the artist. Hopefully, I will be able to commission an artist and have art dedicated to my game. With that being said, I will continue to make updates and changes. As my experience in writing and game design improves, this game will also be improved. I hope you all enjoy this not so good visual novel.<br/><br/>People I would like to thank:</p>\n\n<p>Artists:<br/>Donmalo<br/>XGhastX<br/>DamianKrzywonos<br/>PiotrDura<br/>Nele-Diel</p>\n<p>Character Art:<br/>Design Haven</p>\n<p>Menu Art:<br/>Jennifer Dobyns</p>\n<p>Code:<br/>user Tayruh</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>Will</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:35:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0c739005e3e21754aeeaf48caf219e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MuffinTop Scout"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
