I don't know if this genre already exists but i had this idea and went for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no offensive mechanics in the game, your objective is to steal an object - in this case it's a key - and escape without getting caught, much like Bilbo (The Hobbit). It was because of him that I named the game \"gatuno\", which is a word in portuguese that describes \"cat\" and \"thief\" at the same time and it was used in the portuguese translation of The Hobbit to describe Bilbo.<br/></p>\n<p>The game isn't finished yet and it's very simple, i would really appreciate some feedback on how i could improve the existing mechanics and what things i could add to the game to make it more intresting. This is all i came up with on my on during a week.</p>\r\nThings i wanted to do but wasn't able to:\r\n<p>1. Add a button when you die to automatically restart the game, unfortunately if you die you have to restart the cart manually</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Come up with something to do besides walking. The only input this game needs are the arrow keys, so i tried to come up with some stuff like throwing balls or doing cat noises (it didn't worked that well).</p>\n<p>3. Make the enemy character follow you when you get noticed. Since i have no idea on how to do this on my own and i didn't want to just copy tutorials on my first game\u00a0I just went with: if you were seen, you are dead.</p>\n<p>If you know how to implement any of those things (or more) and you have Pico-8, please, be my guest. Download the game and add to it. If you do this send me back so i can see what you did and learn from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T13:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/748ed3b8a74f79f1257372c080131335.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yonkr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
