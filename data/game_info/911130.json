For example, how do we visualize a time when we watch our favourite show\u2019s brand-new episode vs., we take a very hard exam? Or as a deeper concept, how do we \u201cfeel\u201d time when we witness the birth of a new being vs. the death of a new being? More interestingly, what do we do and how do we transit between those liminal periods from understanding time \u201cas a container and something consumable\u201d to time \u201cas an eternal entity that flows and flies\u201d within the same day?\u00a0 I aimed to create and use two opposite time metaphors \u2013 one is that when time is consumed or spent in a rush, and the other is that when time flows, flies, and feels endless \u2013 in the same game that the main character can feel both and transit from one to another in various moments to create that liminality effect.\u00a0<strong>\u231b</strong></p>\n<p>Later on,\u00a0I expanded my prototype\u00a0on that exploration to the point where how our understanding of and relationship with time changes as we encounter different personas and characters that either have significance in our life or pierce our hearts. What do we think/know about a day of an old person or a day of a baby? How does time feel different as our life gets complex such as being a parent, having a job, or being sick? And how do the choices we make in our life changes our perception of time?\u00a0\u00a0\u231b</p>\n<p>So, here is my ongoing prototype, feel free to enjoy and comment! Any constructive feedback will be highly valuable for me to understand and improve this project!\u00a0\ud83d\udc24</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc615d015527138cb720c9824e8f73e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["\u00d6zgem"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
