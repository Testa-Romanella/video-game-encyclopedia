I started my company \"Arcade Coin\" back in 2015 right after graduating, and for the last two and a half years I have been working on GTTOD as a solo project. It is now nearing completion, so I figured I'd hop on over here and let you guys know I exist again!<br/></p>\n<p>On September 16th, 2016, I released my first demo for GTTOD, and it was met with some pretty negative reviews. Not a lot of people liked it, although they loved the concept. Nearly two years later, GTTOD has 92% positive reviews on Steam and has a pretty decent following on Reddit and Discord. Not bad for a solo project I concepted out while eating a bowl of cereal!</p>\n<p>I now work on GTTOD full time, and I post regular updates online to all the fans who watch! I have also worked on a few other projects with a team, and recently we even won\u00a0the Gooseberry Game Jam! You can check out my other projects by clicking on my profile.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you have fun playing!\\</p>\n<p>-Andrew, GTTOD Dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7cb7698afbadee73f5e37c47b267462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArcadeCoin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
