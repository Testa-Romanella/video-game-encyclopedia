The game tests when a person begins to feel awkward, or self aware of how loud they are being in a public space. It also explores how greeting someone, changes that social etiquette. The relationship the person has with the person they are greeting also changes the social etiquette. Also, the duration of time it has been since they have seen the person they are greeting is a factor. The game is meant to make the people playing feel self aware and self conscious of their vocal level, and in what context they are greeting another person. Throughout the different levels of distance and loudness the player examines the social etiquette of greeting and where these levels would be appropriate, if ever, in a real world context.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1b4a440d074b1c83152acaab2f38088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfurnell"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
