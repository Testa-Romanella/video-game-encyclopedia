They level up when they take another piece, (which is solely cosmetic) and the promote like usual when they reach the back rank of the board.</p>\n<p>There are voice clips for selecting pieces (different ones for unleveled and leveled units), taking pieces, promoting, being in danger of losing, and winning the game. There is also background music.</p>\n<p>If you take a piece,\u00a0\u00a0there's a one second window to pick up your piece again to double skip. I\u00a0didn't implement mandatory skipping since I think that's a dumb rule.</p>\n<p>This should work on all of Windows/Mac/Linux by just running the jar file, but I\u00a0can't test it on a Mac or Linux machine so let me know if you try and that doesn't work.</p>\n<p>I only made the board square images, all of the other assets are from Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to making more substantial and original games with LibGDX in the future!</p><p>UPDATE (6/2/2021): I added a web version! No need to worry about downloading the jar file now. It should have started as soon as you clicked on the page. Just zoom in with your browser to make the game bigger if you'd like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67afec1c94a030fdccda378d5cefd485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Outerim"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
