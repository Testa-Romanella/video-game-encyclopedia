It was my first game jam and I loved it! I\u00a0hope you can enjoy my game too :)\r\nCommands: A, D to Move; Space or W to Jump; Shoot with Left Click mouse\r\nCore Gameplay: You must protect and follow a Totem until the timer runs out. Enemies will spawn from\u00a0random locations, but you can stop them from reaching the Totem by hitting them with your Rewind Gun! Just be careful of their path!\u00a0\r\n\r\nCredits:\u00a0\r\nArt, Warped Caves:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/warped-caves-103250\r\nSound: FREE Cyberpunk Vol. 1 Music Pack\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/free-cyberpunk-vol-1-music-pack-165610\u00a0+ files from Freesound.org\r\nProgramming and design: Done by me with a little help of Chronos\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/chronos-31225\u00a0for time managing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/792c82af423a943c045aa09473f2b5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MarcoSant"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
