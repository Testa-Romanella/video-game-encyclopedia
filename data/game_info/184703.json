These involved planetary rotation to simulate a solar system, multiple enemy types, and attacks/variations. We decided to go small and easy, what we came up with is Asteroids, a small 2D action/strategy game. You play as the little character on top of the earth, and are armed with a bat to deflect asteroids that come flying in randomly from space. Be weary though, alien's will also come to try to destroy your planet as all they seek for is the destruction of the human race! </p><p>Survive for 60 seconds as you get pelted with multiple threats from every direction.</p><p>----</p><p>This game was made by My friend and I for LD38.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47bc1c7df5c2d6deadab3b20706fe84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlazeXenon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
