PLAY THE GAME! ENJOY &amp; HAVE EUN!</p><p>Crunk, a hash brown, and his brother Paco, a human face, have decided to go neck-and-neck by jumping on each other, squashing them in the process. This leads to some crazy multiplayer action as player 1 and player 2 have to work to try and squash each other before the short time limit of 30 seconds rolls around. The map is small - players can loop around the edges like in the original Mario Bros. game. </p><p>Player 1 uses WASD and player 2 uses the arrow keys.</p><p>This game is a parody of bootleg Famicom and NES games.</p><p>This game was written by (HF) Miles for the DUPLICADE game jam http://itch.io/jam/duplicade</p><p>http://fantasticfest.com/arcade</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69ed40f70a4378c4f49f8ebac3fbe193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hfmiles"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
