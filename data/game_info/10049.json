{"id": 10049, "slug": "hitman-codename-47", "name": "Hitman: Codename 47", "name_original": "Hitman: Codename 47", "description": "<p>The game that started the Hitman franchise. The protagonist is a talented yet nameless hitman, known only by his code number 47. He has no past, as he is a clone created by a mad scientist. In the beginning, 47 is being held in a mental hospital, before he escapes to become a killer for hire. His job is to eliminate high-ranking mafia bosses for large sums of money while attracting as little attention as possible. His missions may initially seem unrelated, but the plot eventually ties everything together.</p>\n<p>Hitman has to use precise timing, unconventional tactics, and stealth skills to get to his targets and neutralize their bodyguards. He can attack from behind, use sniper&#39;s rifles, machine guns, or even improvised weapons, such as a halter. There are usually many ways to accomplish every murder. An important part of the gameplay is disguise: Hitman can attack people and steal their clothes to blend into any environment. Dead or unconscious bodies of Hitman&#39;s victims can be dragged away and hidden to avoid raising an alert. Money earned from previous missions can be used to buy additional killing equipment. Hitman may also lose a part of his reward if he kills civilians on a mission.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2000-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3f6/3f6a397ec36acfcc18bb6ab3414c7658.jpg", "website": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-codename-47/", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 177, "owned": 2842, "beaten": 484, "toplay": 40, "dropped": 202, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 576, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 579, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IO Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
