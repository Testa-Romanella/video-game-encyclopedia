At the time I am posting this, I am 16 years old and starting my Junior year of high school. This is my first game! It was developed over a period of two-ish months during which I had feedback from the wonderful people at the \r\n\tIndie Game Collective in Boston. I couldn't have done this game nearly as well without them, so my thanks go out to them!\r\n</p>Contact me!<p>\r\n\tTwitter: \r\n\t@Legorox</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlease feel free to take this game for free. I don't expect any money from this, so take it! Just have fun with it! But if you're feeling way too generous, go and pay something. That's okay, too.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso, I have always had troubles exporting to Mac, so I'm keeping this game as PC only for now. Sorry!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFinally, this is my first game. I know it could be a lot better. And there will definitely be bugs. But honestly, I probably won't fix them. I have a second game to develop, right?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks for looking at my game!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20d63c770d12bc57702823417fa11ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blarfnip"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
