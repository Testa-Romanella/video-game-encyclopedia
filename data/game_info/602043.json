I started 9 hours ago. Anyway, I remade it with some new stuff so look forward to that. Note that there is no title screen, name entry screen or warning screen, since they would not run the game. Part 2\u00a0coming soon.\u00a0 Upon startup you will be taken directly to the school front. You can quit to the menu but the only available option is to play the first map.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>ToffeeRecord for BBT6M Open Source Edition, Petrol Bot assets,\u00a0 NTHLB OSTs and general help.</p>\n<p>JimJamm for the Nathaniel character</p>\n<p>Punkred66 for the swing screen used in this mod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-19T01:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07d/07dc9d91ba438690d64cea2b7f73ef0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GWAYthan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
