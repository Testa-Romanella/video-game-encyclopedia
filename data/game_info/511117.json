You have been thrown into a deadly dungeon.\u00a0 You are not alone. You have company ... Aah, how nice and wonderful ... Well, it is not really that nice. Death saws appear from nowhere and they are out to get you. <br/></p>\n<p>Your task is to guide your blue blob around the dungeon and help him survive for as long as he can before getting diced up by a death saw. Staying still will not award you any points and gives you a higher risk of death. So don't be idle. YOU MUST MOVE OUT THE WAY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.\u00a0\u00a0 <br/><br/>The game will start easy with 1 death saw per 15 seconds. Then 15 seconds after 7 death saws appear ... Ooer!!!<br/><br/>How long can you survive the DEATH SAW CHALLENGE!?!?!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/><br/>Code, graphics, sound effects and music by<br/><strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Tape turbo loader by<br/><strong>Martin Piper</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FREE DOWNLOAD </strong><strong>POSSIBLY COMING 31/10/2020 !!!</strong><br/><br/>This game is<strong> PAL/NTSC </strong>compatible with a stand-alone C64, VICE, Ultimate 64, and theC64, etc...<br/><br/>A Unity 3D Version also intended some time in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee412d2df1216c002131cc61b5302de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
