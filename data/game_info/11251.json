With no set units or factions you are free to create a fleet where each ship has its own balanced strengths and weaknesses, from basic fighters and bombers to hulking battleships and speedy destroyers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenge your strategies and stretch your creativity, perfecting your spaceships' designs before taking them onto the proving grounds of battle. Jump straight into tense fights for territorial control where you maneuver your ships to best use their energy, ranges, firing arcs, turn rates and firepower.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConquer an entire galaxy in the single player campaign, where you collect the parts you need to build bigger and meaner ships. Use them to defeat increasingly tougher and more complex opponents. Test the strength of your designs in multiplayer combat, fighting solo or with allies. Face custom AIs with their own fleet lineups or even design your own AI that fights by your side.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAre you ready?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T16:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b24/b24cc198e5d04d5fa5fc3035a45a07a8.jpg", "website": "http://istrolid.com", "rating": 2.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 15, "owned": 448, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 23, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 23, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["treeform"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["treeform"], "esrb_rating": null}
