{"id": 977482, "slug": "unheroic-misfits", "name": "Unheroic Misfits", "name_original": "Unheroic Misfits", "description": "Unheroic Misfits is a small little story RPG about a kid trying to save their friend. You play as Loo, an insect-like humanoid who explores the yellow, blue, green, and red kingdoms, passing a series of trials by helping other characters overcome their psychological problems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI like to think of it as an RPG, but it\u2019s almost like a visual novel or what I\u2019ve termed interactive literature. Basically, if you\u2019re looking for a traditional RPG experience, this might not be for you. But if you\u2019re willing to try something new and read a lot of text, maybe you should give it a shot! There\u2019s no fighting: the major interactions are exclusively dialogue-centric. There\u2019s also only one ending, but feel free to interpret it however you\u2019d like.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe characters of Unheroic Misfits tend to alternate from goofy to philosophical, and sometimes both at the same time. There are lots of metaphors and symbolic elements: I wasn\u2019t joking when I described it as interactive literature!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMade in RPG Maker XP, the game lasts about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how many NPCs you choose to interact with. My hope is that experiencing Unheroic Misfits will be cathartic both for people who have struggled with mental health and for people trying to accept the loss of a loved one.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T05:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/474bacb9543b5d63c09708ac07f39af0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Noori"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
