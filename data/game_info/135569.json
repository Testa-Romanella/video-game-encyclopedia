It is a 2-player chess game with one person in VR playing against a second on the desktop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you'd like to have your own personalized chess set made and added to this collection, please contact us to make arrangements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/40855ad55407cb2019bc0378518f7aaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["intern019"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
