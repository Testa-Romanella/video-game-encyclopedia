Steve, however, feels stuck in time. He can't grow, he can't improve himself and he can't find the motivation to do it. Then one day, a mysterious voice calls him, and offers him a pact: \"I can help you. I can improve your life, but it won't be easy. You will have to go through a long path, and only then will you be able to get out of the cage you are trapped in\". Steve, somewhat unconsciously, accepts the deal, and is immediately sent into his past. His aim is therefore to fix his past mistakes in order to unblock his present situation.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>A/D or\u00a0Arrow Keys\u00a0- <strong>Move\u00a0</strong><br/>Space or Up Arrow - <strong>Jump\u00a0</strong><br/>E or Z - <strong>Pick Up Objects</strong><br/>F or X - <em><strong>Switch from Present to Past</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>[This game was made for the <em>Indie Game Dev Beginners #002</em> game jam]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T09:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d918e13d6c6e123f12aa928fb8ee2e3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mino"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
