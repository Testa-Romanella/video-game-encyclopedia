Together with a misterious and mythical storytelling about a very peculiar village, the player is given the opportunity to immerse himself in a quest to understand the main character's past.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main phylosophy behind this game is to challenge the player's expertise in puzzle solving, while also showing him that sometimes Nature can help him figure out the path if we stop, observe it and plan our next move. This feeling is similar to the real world, when any one of us is to busy looking at what's next on the agenda, instead of pausing and evaluating what should the next step be from time to time.</p>\n<p>Your character is gifted with bending powers. He can use the four primal elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) to interact with the environment and the structures spread along the levels, in order to solve the puzzles.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Source Code:\u00a0https://github.com/AntoniooCruz/FEUP-DJCO-2/</p>\n\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Unzip the file and run the executable</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T05:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4c6dd38a32d671e0174bc32e0c6caa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AntonioCruz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
