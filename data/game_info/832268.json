Not sure what happened there. Redirects to blank page. Esc gets you out but you won't be able to click anything.\u00a0Sorry if sound is loud or annoying.<br/></p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Do not click on the debug options at the bottom of the Main Menu</strong>. Forgot to remove those. They run shell commands to compile/run the game so don't panic if you click that and\u00a0see console windows popping up. Not sure what will happen if you don't have godot and the source available to compile. Would expect some form of error.</p>\n<p><strong>GameJam Notes:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Completed as part of a multi-player game jam. My goal was to create a multi-player turn-based\u00a0framework that I could use for future projects.\u00a0</p><p>The game was submitted pretty hot so it's possible that you might see some bugs. It's also possible that hosted sessions could get orphaned on the Host/Join page and attempting to connect to them might not work. I was in the middle of testing and adding error handling/disconnect logic when my time ran out.</p>\n<p><strong>The Game:</strong></p>\n<p>The classic game of Nim with multi-player support. Utilizes P2P so you can join public games and/or host your own sessions. Invite your friends for a game.</p>\n<p>Game Jam Details:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/multiplayer<br/></p>\n<p>Player Avatar Artwork Provided By:\u00a0https://metalsnail.itch.io/watercolour-monster-pack\u00a0(I'll add this to about after the game jam)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd8afa5bdae13047c506134e8965248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrayDwarf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
