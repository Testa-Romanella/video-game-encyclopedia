But Fimbulwinter fell a decade ago and your clans, once bound by blood and\u00a0 honour, now fight, scrounge and steal for every resource.</em><br/><br/><strong><em>SVELLUND</em></strong><em> is an ice planet. It didn\u2019t used to be that way, but it is now.</em> <em>Fuel, materials, food, and comfort are rare. Your clans eagerly await the trading ships. But it\u2019s your home, your land, and you wouldn\u2019t leave it- not for anything. <br/><br/><strong>24XX: Fimbulwinter\u00a0</strong>is a rules-lite sci-fi/fantasy rpg based on Norse mythology and lasers.
