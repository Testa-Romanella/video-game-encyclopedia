It features controls that take more effort to master than most games. It can take up to 1 or 2 hours of playtime for the controls to feel more natural. It does not feature a map system and only guides the player in a minimal way. You can use pen and paper to annotate the downloadable map if necessary (available on the game's subreddit). Some optional areas might even only be accessible to a few naturally gifted players. </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T07:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db011b55d375979fc4a7b8bc151b8fe0.jpg", "website": "https://joshuaslegs.github.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["petitlegume"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["petitlegume studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
