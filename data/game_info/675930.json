As far as I know this is my first solo entry...and I guess also my first entry ever?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made with Construct 3. Visuals mostly in Blender with Aseprite helping management. Collision sound made with sfxr.</p>\n<p>Change Log: Fixed the physics so the game doesn't break when you bump into things. Had to also delete the background parallax as Construct 3 reverted to its limited free version and it was either GUI or parallax that had to go.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:06:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a249ca92abe5837ac2cf047fb131b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Skaiway"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
