The 100 puzzles are a series of Mexican standoffs where the goal is to make sure all characters kill each other. However, you can't control any of the characters directly. In order to succeed in your task you have to change the environment around them. <br/>You accomplish this by manipulating the environment directly or by the use of different items provided in your inventory. <br/><br/><br/><br/>These include but are not limited to:<br/>A frying pan, falling ladders, bullets, maybe an EXPLOSIVE barrel or two and much more!<br/>The ultimate goal remains the same: leaving no one alive!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gameplay is split into two phases: the planning phase and the cinematic action phase. During the planning phase time is frozen and you, the player get to use your items and adjust the environment in a way you think will result in the death of every character on the screen. <br/>When pressing play your attempt is then put to the test! The action phase sets the camera into cinematic mode and lets you watch the carnage unfold, ultimately seeing if your attempt worked or not. Should you fail, you revise your attempt and try again!<br/>Are you a completionist that is looking for that little extra? Then you're in luck! Several levels have optional Bonus Objectives that add an additional layer of challenge to the puzzle-solving, often requiring innovative solutions of greater difficulty.<br/>Remember the objective!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T03:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d41d8ebf152f9fe8b0e171b84cc5ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Armchair Developers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Armchair Developers"], "esrb_rating": null}
