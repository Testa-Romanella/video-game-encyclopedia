It's single-player and requires no previous knowledge to play. Score is based on how many fireballs you dodge before you get hit. Try to rack up the highest score possible! (I would love to see some screenshots in the comment section!)\u00a0The speed of the fireball increases as your score increases, so you'll need to stay on your toes!\u00a0You lose when the knight gets charred by the fireball 3 times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W or Up Arrow - Move Up</p>\n<p>A or Left Arrow - Move Left</p>\n<p>S or Down Arrow - Move Down</p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow - Move Right</p>\n<p>Escape Key - Pause game</p>\n<p>My background:</p>\n<p>I've been learning C#\u00a0through Visual Studio\u00a0at school for the past year, and our final assessment was to create a game. That's where\u00a0<em>Dungeon Shuffle\u00a0</em>came from. I had to figure out how I could make a fun, unique game with the limited tools available\u00a0on a Windows Form. I'm still hoping to add more to the game in the form of new levels and power-ups, but I'd love to hear any additional feedback that could help me make the game even better.\u00a0 Again, don't expect anything amazing because this is the first real game I've created from scratch. Aside from that, have fun! I wish you\u00a0good luck in the dungeon!</p>\n<p>**All art in the game (excluding the keys in the controls menu and the hearts that show\u00a0 lives left) is\u00a0originally created by me. Most things were drawn with reference but I still want to count that as original :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f4948b001bf8a43451da649d1f14d6bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AgentAero"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
