Your \n      enemies are plotting to revive Zaggart, \u201cThe Dark One,\u201d who was sealed \n      beneath the six continents of Mistral. It\u2019s up to Landis, descendant of \n      the heroic Dyu, to stop them. Choose the order in which to attack the \n      six stages. Before each stage, select one of four magic armors and use \n      crystals you\u2019ve collected during your battles to buy items. Selecting \n      the right armor for each stage is the key to your ultimate victory. Then \n      get ready to face awesome enemies like a fire-spewing sea serpent or a \n      giant insect. Whether it\u2019s the fast-paced shooting or breaking into the \n      fortress of a stage boss, you\u2019ll be blown away by the intensity of Lords \n      of Thunder.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
