She's going to have nightmares and she must confront her fears. This nightmares will be presented as enemies or bosses she has to defeat. Her room will mutate with each boss battle. Each boss would represent a different fear and would need different strategies to be defeated. At the end the core is a platformer skill game. A mix between super crate box, shovel knight and in some way binding of isaac. </p><p>Here yo can find the ludum dare page:</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&amp;uid=13148<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e1194a0f75c869e49141470e79998f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bitnenfer"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
