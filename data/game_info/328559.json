The art is recycled from a prior project. The reason I decided to make this game was to test whether it would be practical to have a randomiser running which picks a number corresponding to a pre-made section of track. I am pretty happy with the outcome and I feel that, with more time put into making more interesting and varied track segments, this is an idea which I may revisit for future games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c4d25a272ec1dd78b2ff1b061b6369e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MichaelSollarsGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
