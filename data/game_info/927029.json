Some passengers are oblivious victims, while others boarded this train with a plan already in motion.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Love Exalt 8372</strong> is a mystery visual novel inspired by games like <strong>Danganronpa,</strong> <strong>Your Turn to Die,</strong> and the <strong>Zero Escape</strong> series. The story will be mostly linear, but the most sensitive information will be locked in the heads of the characters; to gain access to their thoughts, you'll have to play minigames and be observant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By catching thought events as you play, you'll be able to read the minds of the characters and discover clues about why they're here and what they're keeping secret from the other passengers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you pay close attention and know what to look for, you'll be able to collect notes and documents that flesh out the world surrounding these characters, moments of their history, and pieces of the bigger picture.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Occasionally the story will break into a branching path that explores the perspectives of different characters. Choose to follow your favorite character and see things from their perspective; if you're suspicious of somebody, keep an eye on them.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a68/a6842511f326d7c655ced3f3ed46c433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["vaartis", "Veki", "Team Veki"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Veki"], "esrb_rating": null}
