Try to find the best angle of attack against the wind and catch as much fish as possible. The bigger the fish, the more the food. Red fish are sharks.<br/></p>\n<p>And yes, you can zoom in and out with z and x, but you're not really supposed to...\u00a0;-)</p>\n<p>Secret tip: Press Return before starting the game with Space - to enable all debug features. Then\u00a0 you can press S to track a shark instead of the city, F to track a fish and C to go back to the City.
