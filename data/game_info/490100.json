All blocks fall at once, on the beat. You can tap the arrow keys in the same direction you're moving, or tap space, to accelerate the blocks.<br/></p>\n<p>Like any good Tetris-alike, the game gets faster as you play. There is no win condition, only a \"losing less hard\" condition. The end screen comes for us all.</p>\n<p>Try out Math Rock mode for a real thrill!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677ebf94a4d3e64cf293b8d7ce3283e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearsharktopus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
