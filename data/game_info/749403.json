It's about 15-20 minutes in length. This is the result of me making a game in a month. I had an idea for\u00a0a teleport mechanic that I hadn't seen a lot of other games do, so I decided to make a prototype. You create a stationary orb that you can teleport to at any time. Try to reach the end of the level.</p>\n\n<p>You can watch the creation of this project and get updates on future projects by subscribing to\u00a0my Youtube and Rumble channels.</p>\n\n<p>https://rumble.com/c/FreeComet</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLQFH8v2IgtPfHzVKRLjXlA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c659d726b5346e240b44c1f5fab5e454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreeComet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
