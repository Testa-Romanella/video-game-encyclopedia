You can move, pick up a weapon or shoot. <br/></p>\n<p>Enemies will come at you in waves, and will leave behind skeletons when killed. Skeletons serve as obstacles which can be used to crowd control monsters, but can also hinder you when you're trying to get away. \u00a0Skeletons can be shot down by both you and monsters.</p>\n<p>You're also constantly being chased by Death, a creature that cannot be killed and only moves when you don't. <br/></p>\n<p>You take damage when you either get attacked or when you're completely surrounded at the start of your turn.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play this game by yourself or with a friend locally.</p>\n\n<p>Initially this was meant as a gameplay demo to pitch a concept to friends, but it turned out better than I expected so I thought it would be neat to make it available here.</p>\n<p>The game is nowhere near done but I do feel like the demo shows the direction<br/>I want to take this game in well enough.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a8eae8430ccc4b72b849a48788fe96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Janniemannie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
