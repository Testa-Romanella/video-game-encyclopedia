This ink story follows you, the main character as you go around a mansion trying to escape it. Find clues on why you are here and when you got here. There is a deeper secret than you know.

This is also my first ink game!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:22:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0887c63acf76bcb95d0e0823a4e3f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vishyfishyink"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
