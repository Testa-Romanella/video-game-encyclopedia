You and Maddox go way back, having first met in high school; you weren\u2019t their biggest fan then, and you certainly aren\u2019t one now either, thanks to their rather obnoxious, snooty attitude towards everyone and their tendency to drag you into their odd schemes time after time.</p>\n<p><strong>Santana Vanhoudt</strong> (she/her or he/him)</p>\n<p>Deputy Mayor Vanhoudt\u2019s child. You are first introduced to Santana via Maddox. You have your reservations towards them for reasons more than obvious, but Santana soon proves to be quite different from what you had expected from a kid of a politician, though you do think there is something more to them than meets the eye.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Harlan Crow</strong> (he/him)</p>\n<p>Your co-worker assigned by your boss to keep an eye on you as your gig with Maddox begins. Though you\u2019re not too familiar with him, you quickly come to notice that Harlan and Maddox seem to have a somewhat volatile relationship with each other.
