You decided to investigate and collect it.</p>\n<p>That game is my entry for the Chronicles GameDev Challenge Week 5. It's a clone of flappy bird but with mechanics that fit the theme of the jam 'Muse'.</p>\n<p>Every time you collect the matter, time slows down and you can prepare for the next one, but your speed also inceases.</p>\n<p>There is no challenge, just fly, collect (or don't) and enjoy the scenery and the music. Every bit of this game is made by me with the exception of the wind sound you can hear over the engine sound.</p>\n<ul><li>Game engine: Godot 3.1</li><li>Music: Sunvox 1.9.4</li><li>3D: Blender 2.79</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T03:55:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/9887bed7e94f1c542c902c6c4f356700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["crazyrems"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
