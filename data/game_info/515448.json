This game is a city builder except you go backwards. In this game you build a city (Not destroy it ;] ). You have to keep upgrading (Not exploding) your buildings until they are all fully upgraded ( NOT fully destroyed). The more you build and the faster you do it the more points you will revive and your citizens will become more great full (Totally not getting destruction points or gaining suspicion).
