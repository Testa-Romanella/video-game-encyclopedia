Players will work on a team to accomplish realistic space operations by controlling multiple capabilities on separate spacecraft, communicating over unique signal sets, and leveraging advanced terrestrial capabilities.  RedSpace Ops allows players to Chair-Fly space missions to help them understand the complexities of the local space environment.<br/>\r\nThe game is set in our local cis-lunar arena and will soon includes a timeline going back to 1877. Players will explore the space domain to learn about the various characteristics of Research, Experimentation and Demonstration (RED) Space capabilities.  <br/>\r\nRedSpace controllers will soon use a variety of sensors to find and follow small objects in the darkness of space, identify them without entering warning zones, report on their behavior, and when necessary, execute dynamic space control to mitigate threats to the domain. <br/>\r\nPlayers will eventually interact with RedSpaceOps at three levels of play: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the tactical level, players will control the movement of their spacecraft and its sensors. They will have to follow precise C2 instructions to avoid threats and collect data on the space environment.  This is essentially a \u201cdrivers\u201d perspective and is showcased by a minimum viable product in Space Cowboy ADR.<br/>\r\nAt the operational level, players will manage their assigned constellation of spacecraft and decide how to allocate their exquisite resources. They will also have to manage the logistics and launch of alert and spare spacecraft.  This is a team manager role focused on operational movement of assigned assets.<br/>\r\nAt the strategic level, players will plan their research, money and time investments, and develop new mission areas to prepare systems and capabilities for future situations.  Players will track progress of R&amp;D efforts, and make strategic decisions based on the collected intel from tasked missions. <br/>\r\nThe first RedSpaceOp is SpaceCowboy.  In this module players capture and remove small pieces of space debris reducing operational risk to you team's assets and stewarding the orbital environment.  Players goal is to collect and dispose or repurpose space debris to earn funding needed to pay for a tanker to refuel the asset. Debris repurposed is used as the raw material for in-space manufacture. Future versions of SpaceCowboy aim to collect and sort space debris so that it can be powderized and used for 3d printing in orbit.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nChairFly represents the operational level of RedSpace Ops.  While the player is still in tactical control of a specific space asset, they additionally act as the mission commander of a space campaign.  This module allows a space controller to ROCdrill the execution sequence of a fiscal year campaign, or OP ORDER timeline.  This force packaging experience will help identify capability gaps and inform acquisition requirements for decades to come.<br/>\r\nThe strategic component of RedSpace Ops is captured by Ascendant Space Strategic Sim, (or AS3).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAS3 is a Real time strategy game where players Guide their nation's efforts to develop the Solar System and become the ultimate superpower. Players will Manage personnel, research, production, and operations in this expansive simulation Modeled on current events and the Russia, China, and US competition.  AS3 provides valuable insight into the future possibilities a thriving space economy will bring, as well as a glimpse at the major consequences a nation will face if space domain development and protection is ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRedSpace Ops vision is to provide an immersive and educational experience that teaches players the basic blocking and tackling concepts of space maneuver warfare. The ultimate goal is to help players develop an understanding of the speeds, distances, power requirements, and lethality of the local space environment and manmade systems deployed in the domain. Players will achieve this by exploring various areas of our solar system, with a particular focus on the region between Earth and Moon La Grange Point 2. As players progress through the game, they will gain a deeper understanding of the complex systems and technologies required for successful space missions.  After completing this gaming series, a new generation of warfighters will be motivated and excited to pursue opportunities in Space Force or the commercial space economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFuture Space &amp; Building Games Features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Explore the cis-lunar environment and experience the environmental effects of our local space.<br/>\r\n- Upgrade your sensors to improve your space situational awareness and communication speed.<br/>\r\n- Compete against other teams to test your space skills.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T06:47:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/042493ad0708a6e3639cb3fc9e621b8e.jpg", "website": "https://k4activedefense.com/redspace-app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floyd Kerr", "Cayden Park"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Floyd Kerr"], "esrb_rating": null}
