To shoot characters, the DJ must close his eyes for a short duration to accumulate ammunition.<br/> <br/> While the Watcher's eyes are closed, the players and AI have a window to rush towards the finish line, but if they are still running when the Watcher opens his eyes, they will be easily spotted and eliminated.<br/> <br/> While the Watcher's eyes are open, the other players <strong>must synchronize their movement to the beat of the music</strong>, to keep in sync with the AI and remain ambiguously undetected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b295fd24f5e723cfa688acc73814b61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["epicsaxteam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
