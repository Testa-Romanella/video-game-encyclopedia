An Incredibly short game drawn up and coded in less than a day due to being busy for the rest of the jam. Technically this is also the first game I've ever 100% completed and not given up on part way through I would really like any Feedback. It was made using Unity Personal and MS Paint with Gimp being used for transparency.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/0257a8c7735b664c916ca851241cca69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
