It consists of an exposure session, through which the user is asked by the Therapist to complete the three steps of the therapy, in order to learn how to manage and reduce his anxiety. Thanks to the VR approach, the user will be able to live a supervised experience that will allow him to face the object of his phobia, which being virtual, will never hurt him.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>W A S D / arrow keys to move</li><li>camera rotation with mouse</li><li>Mouse left / right click</li><li>Q and E to interact</li></ul>\r\nCharacters\r\n<em>Therapist Noah.\u00a0</em>He will guide you through the whole experience.\u00a0<em>VR14.\u00a0</em>It will be by your side during each step of the therapy.\r\nAbout us\r\n<p>This application was developed for the 2021/2022 Virtual Reality Course of Politecnico di Torino by:</p>\n<ul><li>Garini Andrea</li><li>Pachera Giovanni</li><li>Peron Filippo</li><li>Semeraro Lorenzo</li><li>Retta Nicola</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:03:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/00873b26a2bd248f8f470d37cc3e7aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gruppo14VR", "giovanni_pachera", "nicolaretta", "rareseed57"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
