The player will have to solve difficult puzzles and look for not obvious ways to overcome obstacles, as well as blow up the enemies from the rocket launcher and the gamma gun that hinder the process. You will not be able to pass the level from the first time - you will often die and start over again until you find the right path and learn the level to follow through on your way to the portal. Passage of the game is based on experience and mistakes, so be prepared for the fact that the game will burn your chair!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n\u2022 15 levels with increasing difficulty<br/>\r\n\u2022 A variety of deadly traps<br/>\r\n\u2022 Several types of weapons<br/>\r\n\u2022 Great design and graphics<br/>\r\n\u2022 Awesome music from TripZay", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509c602a0ed42a53bcc34ba71ede84e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BekkerDev Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BekkerDev Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
