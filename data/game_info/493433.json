While the cathedral is currently closed for restoration, it is still possible to visit it thanks to Ubisoft\u2019s VR experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the heart of the videogame Assassin\u2019s Creed : Unity , the 3D reconstitution of Notre-Dame de Paris was the result of 5000 hours of detailed graphic work, guided by historians.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdapted from on this acclaimed model, the virtual visit offers multiple point-of-views, some of which were inaccessible to the public, and ends spectacularly with a hot-air balloon flight over its arches, in a lively environment of Paris in the XVIIIth century.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn a 4 to 9 square meters zone, the visitor is invited to look around and take a few steps to admire each perspective of the monument, to the sound of its famous Cavaill\u00e9-Coll Organ performing J.S. Bach.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis experience has been shown for the first time at the UNESCO Headquarters on Heritage Days 2019 and was part of the South by Southwest Virtual Cinema 2020 selection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T19:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b10656a576445af6ce552310d1bbc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 181, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ubisoft"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
