Merging stones from people will also\u00a0<em>merge</em> the people together, uniting them under one light.<br/></p>\n<p>I made\u00a0Suspenders Joe for ScoreSpace Jam #14.</p>\r\nWhat can you do\r\n<p>You can hold 1 stone of each color (current inventory is displayed on the top left). You can pick up a stone as soon as it lights up (you can pick up multiple stones of different color at once if you're in range). If you pick up a stone that is already in your inventory it will evaporate, never to be seen again - so be careful!</p>\n<p>When you get in range of a person a legend will appear at the top of your screen, showing you what kind of a stone they need to merge - only the correct color combination will merge the stones!<br/></p>\n\r\nScore\r\n<p>You get a point every time you merge two stones and bring bright light to the person. You don't have a lot of time, so make sure to memorize the legend, learn the map and execute the best route possible.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the <strong>WASD </strong>or <strong>arrow keys\u00a0</strong>to move and use the <strong>spacebar</strong> or the <strong>left mouse button</strong> to pick up stones and merge them once in range of either a stone or a person.</p>\r\nWork\r\n<p>I made everything my self, from coding, pixel art, music, to game design.\u00a0 It was completed in 2 days as part of the\u00a0ScoreSpace Jam #14.<br/>You can follow me or check out the other stuff I've been working on.</p>\n<p>https://www.buckyside.com/<br/>https://twitter.com/SideBucky</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d09c7a5806749de6743093098ae8a847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BuckySide"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
