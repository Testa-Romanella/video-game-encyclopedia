Each stage is based on a specific era in time, so the player may find yourself running from a Dinosaur or in a gun duel in a western background. Also, this game uses the tap action (\"clicking\" with a mouse or \"tapping\" on a mobile screen), so you may tap really fast on a stage, tap only when something appears on screen and etc.</p>\n<p>I really want this game to become a collaborative project, so everyone can build new stages or even improve the gameplay or graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>You can contribute to this project on my GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/mariotoledo/just-tap-to-travel-in-time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/118/1186494292224f40bc7744ce0f37f53c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mario Toledo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
