Inspired by classics of the incremental genre such as Kittens Game and Universal Paperclips, he decided to make an incremental game of his own, adding in RPG elements and imbuing his creation with his own art style.<br/><br/>Soon enough, cooljingle joined in with the programming. The first version of the game featured one world of 64 tiles; the name Feartress was inspired by the danish word for 64 (fire\u00adog\u00adtres).
