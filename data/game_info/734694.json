{"id": 734694, "slug": "wrath-unleashed", "name": "Wrath Unleashed", "name_original": "Wrath Unleashed", "description": "<p>Wrath Unleashed is a chess-like game that combines strategy with combat, not unlike that of The Unholy War, or Archon: The Light and the Dark. The basic idea of the game is there is a war between the gods of the four elements, which shattered their homeworld into an asteroid belt, sustained by their powers. In the game, one god attempts to claim the territory of another god with their army of mythical creatures, which move over a &quot;board&quot; of hexagonal spaces (each space representing a type of terrain). When two opposing troops occupy the same hexagonal space, gameplay shifts to an arena, where the troops must battle to the death for the right to occupy the space. The point of the game is to position the one&#39;s troops over spaces which contain the enemy&#39;s temples.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-06T04:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3b7a6f20de0237578845f640c964e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["The Collective"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
