I\u2019m here to learn about the world. But exploring is turning out a little bit harder than I thought\u2026. Please help me! I need food and somewhere to sleep. But most importantly, I need cough drops! \u00a0To go on adventures! Let\u2019s explore everyday!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Meet skippy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Skippy is a very cute and awesome little thing coming from somewhere unknown. it\u2019s very curious and can get into a bit of trouble\u2026. but why's it at your front door?? oh well, its just too cute to not take it in!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Explore everywhere!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Take skippy out on fun fmv (full motion video) explorations! What will you find? What will Skippy learn? What will *you* learn? But what will happen when you finish exploring???!?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Take care of skippy!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Skippy isn\u2019t too high maintenance, and all you need to do is make sure it gets enough sleep and enough cough drops to eat by playing some short, simple mini games between explorations! What will happen when the mysterious, unnamed meter fills up?....\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Skippy is a short game made for the Virtual Pet Jam 2022 in just over 2 weeks. It features mainly digitized images and full motion video for its graphics, and is a simple gameplay-light experience, and is inspired by things like Moon anti-rpg, Petscop, and itemLabel!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the Virtual Pet Jam\u2019s secret theme, \u2018In the Zone\u2019, came from our writer and lead designer\u2019s recent feelings of going out on walks to take breaks from studying and working as a student. Skippy! was our attempt to reframe the idea of being \u2018in the zone\u2019 to being able to enjoy our surroundings rather than just focusing on one task or thing at hand. To be \u2018in the zone\u2019, we gotta know where zone is, after all!\r\n  </p>\n<p>????????\r\n</p>\n<p>hey........ whats that?!?!?!\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>follow skippy on twitter!</p>\n<p>If we were to work on this project a bit more, we were hoping to add a couple more explorations, some nicer animations, and some more dialogues/sounds, but nothing majorly game-changing, so we're all very proud of the project!\u00a0 Feedback is very much appreciated in the comments below, or reach out to me (dexter) on twitter !</p>\n<p>We hope you have fun exploring with skippy, and thank you for playing!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Dexter McChesney \u2013 Lead design, writing, art, film, production, and programming<br/>twitter / itch.io (under construction) / website to be made soon</p>\n<p>Evan Samuel (of Heurlectic) \u2013 Lead programming, design, and sound/music<br/>twitter / itch.io / website / steam games</p>\n<p>Athena Chang \u2013 Sound/music, design\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2018Lesbian Menace\u2019 \u2013 sound/music<br/>itch.io</p>\n<p>Skippy - skippy, cough drop supplier<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ivery Chen, Elizabeth Xu, Diana Gong, Jazmyn Babler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48b2fba3a2cc5124e7e1ecc561167c76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Heurlectic", "dexmakesgames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
