This is my first time using Chronos, which works beautifully with Bolt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It partly drew inspiration from the amazing movie Tenet and its time traveling style, but I also just wanted to fool around with time control in Chronos.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a fairly short game (7 levels), but the difficulty in the last two levels makes up for that. You'll have to think in reverse to get through the levels. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>Collect the key to unlock the door. If there is no key, the door is unlocked automatically.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>A and D or arrow keys to control left/right</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>R to rewind time</li><li>T to reset level</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>World Rules</strong></p>\n<p>The clock in the background will rewind time when it hits the red tick. You cannot control yourself while rewinding, but your character can still move blocks.</p>\n<p>The three special blocks have different effects when you rewind:</p>\n<ul><li>Orange Drop Blocks: Get affected by gravity</li><li>Green On Blocks: Turn off</li><li>Red Off Blocks: Turn on</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T18:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f0f36380bb3bf6ab083cecbb72a66b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RubiusTwon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
