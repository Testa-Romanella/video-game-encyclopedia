A deep fog surrounds you, along with some overturned tractors. In front of you, you can faintly make out a barn. The sounds get noticeably louder, and as you turn you see a disturbing sight. Dozens of abhorrent creatures, reminiscent of people, with vegetables growing out of their eyes lunge at you.\u00a0 Your memory starts to return to you, this is your farm, and these are the very men who you forced to slave away for you until death, and now they're coming back for revenge.\u00a0\u00a0With a trusty pistol nearby you run for cover and await the incoming horde.</p>\n<p>What Romaines of Kolonel Korn is a wave-based zombie shooter.
