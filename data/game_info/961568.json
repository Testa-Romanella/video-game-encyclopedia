Jump to the top to save the world, get all the females, and revenge on the King for kicking you into the dungeon.  The deep punishment from a fall makes the success of getting to the top that much sweeter.  Good skill to anyone who attempts this game.  You are going to need it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Revolutionary jumping predictor to easily show where you will probably jump, most of the time.  With the jump predictor the game becomes a game of skill instead of guessing.<br/>\r\n- Continuous fluid scrolling as you jump so you always know exactly where the next jump is.<br/>\r\n- \"Peasant Mode\" available for a true peasant experience.<br/>\r\n- AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 also known as FSR.  Great for high frame rates at insane resolutions like 4K, 8K, and beyond.<br/>\r\n- Twitch connection should be working so Chat messages will appear in game and / or cause a random jump to happen while playing.  Bit amounts for each can be set separately.  Twitch connection is done through web browser so no personal info is done through game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMap:<br/>\r\n- Jump you way through 5 hand crafted sections.  Crafted to look nice, and to be hard, but not impossible.<br/>\r\n- Each section has its own theme, and different unique jumping challenges.  Each section stays exciting by slightly changing how and when the jump needs to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAtmosphere:<br/>\r\n- Full 3D beautiful backgrounds optimized to run on lower end systems.<br/>\r\n- Sound effects that make you feel like you are climbing to insane heights in a real world.<br/>\r\n- Characters help cheer you on as you work you way to the top.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T03:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfd175cb9f1af695cfcadf5e4e31c14d.jpg", "website": "http://newtongames.net/peasant-jump-quest-extreme-ai-8k/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Newton Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Newton Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
