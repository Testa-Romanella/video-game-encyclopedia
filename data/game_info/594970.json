The value being passed in was  rounding to an int and remaining at 0 always, causing no pitch  adjustments to the music. Also lighting settings got lost, so that's corrected.<br/></p>\r\nv1.0.1\r\n<p>Song started  playing again every time the game returned to the menu while the  original source continued playing. Don\u2019t want people to throw their  headphones in the trash.\r\n</p>\r\nv1.0.0\r\n<p>Original  submission! Totally functional and playable, highly recommend muting  after your first death though (as the music triggers to play again, and  the original source continues playing, so it becomes awful).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0efca64a83aa9d81e5c1c7a7b3e1e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jake Uskoski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
