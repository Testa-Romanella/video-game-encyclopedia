I decided to make a fully interactable Pokedex using the Veekun database. Going 3D was partly due to having other 3D projects in the works where I was already learning Blender. This project was the first time I worked with 3D world space UI, so it was great to see the final product come to life very quickly through Unity's UI tools.</p><p>Install instructions</p>\n<p>1.
