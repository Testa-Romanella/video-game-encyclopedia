RPG by Datz", "description": "<p>A demo for my concept RPG where you can choose how you play. You can pick one of four unique heroes with their own unique skillset.</p>\n<p>- An Elf who can wield swords and bows against his foes. He can summon forest companions to help defeat monsters.</p>\n<p>-A Clown that can wield a wide assortment of silly weapons. His power comes from his amazing ability to stupefy and amaze friend or foe. He can summon assistants that can help control the battlefield while he defends. A tactical style for balancing TP and crowd control.</p>\n<p>-A Royal Vampire that starts very weak but can slowly gain permanent power from draining her enemies. She summons thralls and skeletons that can help defend her frail body from damage. A glass cannon style.</p>\n<p>-A Feline Amazon that wields spears and claws that quickly cut into her opponents. She uses her rage in battle to replenish her stamina and can summon elemental cats to benefit any playstyle. A fun style for monster hunters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/134f4ed4894fb98adfcc59d8731202aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Datzz2"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
