This is an Idea I've had for a while and I merged it with the theme of \"roll of a dice\". The game is complete but very buggy and there's a lot to expand on. I think It gives a small look into what a finished fully polished version could look like.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Thank you to anyone who plays the game and rates it!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n\n<p>The Orange Cat is fast moving and high jumping.</p>\n<p>The Black Cat is slow moving and low jumping but very strong.</p>\n<p>The Purple Cat is very fast moving but doesn't jump.</p>\n\n<p>Push around boxes, jump on loaded springs, and weave between the rain drops. Try to make it home in one piece, and avoid the dogs if you can.</p>\n\n\n<p>Secrets:</p>\n<p>Dogs have a chance of rolling into birds. Birds will fly away from you.</p>\n<p>The game will randomly roll your character to keep you on your toes.</p>\n<p>Spikes will kill dogs.</p>\n\n\n<p>Everything should be working as intended but since this was made in two days there is bound to be major bugs. Sorry if you run into any.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>\u25ba\u25ba Watch me build the game:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH80D0pRe33sWrSDjDHcWH8YQtm2l5A9X</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba\u25ba SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/varigonstudios/?sub_confirmation=1\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25ba\u25ba SUPPORT: https://www.patreon.com/varigonstudios\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25ba\u25ba MORE: https://varigonstudios.com\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25ba\u25ba JOIN: https://discord.gg/U9w8Vaf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea61e9cc16ffaae662eadfc8ac98672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VARIGON STUDIOS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
