Your mission is to patrol the asteroid belt and protect Earth from aliens hiding there preparing to attack as they are seeking the enemy aliens they were hunting those many years ago causing the UFO crash to Earth.</p>\n<p>Watch for suspicious asteroids and for the stalkers that are hidden and break free from them and then stalk your EDF ship to destroy it. But most importantly, vigilantly monitor for the fast and deadly enemy alien destroyers that fire dangerous nuclear torpedoes! The fusion core of your EDF ship provides nearly inexhaustible energy for space travel, a robust shield, and light blast weapon system. The shield can be used defensively when under attack but can also be used offensively to dispatch objects and enemies. Be careful, though, two hits will drop your shields and it will take some time before they will get restored to their normal levels. When using the offensive capabilities of the shield if the level is too low the fusion core will be overloaded and your ship destroyed!</p>\n<p><strong>GAME CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys / Gamepad D-Pad = Move Ship<br/>Space / Gamepad X  = Fire Blaster (Hold down for rapid fire)<br/>R / Gamepad Start = Return to Menu<br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/3870b966f05cfc03fa10bd765857d10a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["StreetmanGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
