Strategy revolves around anticipating the enemy's actions - the next 10 of them can be seen at all times - and moving in a way that makes as efficient use of the barriers as possible.</p>\n<p>Try to stay in the game as long as you can and you might end up on the global leaderboard!<br/></p>\n<p>------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A/D to move<br/>SPACE to use a powerup<br/>W/S to swap between powerups</p>\n<p>A detailed description of layers and powerups can be found here.<br/></p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>If you'd like, you can view the game's code on its Github page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T08:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/936/93676cdc2fc215ba0b1b1a0547b77b18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Meyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
