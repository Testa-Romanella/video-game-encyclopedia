How this game is different from the classic pong is: players are\u00a0 not locked to just up and down movement, the ball will speed up after the player collides with it, there is no score but instead goal tiles which act\u00a0 as the player's \"life\".</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to destroy all your opponents goal tiles before your opponent destroys yours.There are initially six tiles and when the player's\u00a0 tiles all disappear the player loses.\u00a0Goal tiles are destroyed when the ball collides with the tile. When the ball collides with a tile the ball's speed will reset and the tile will disappear.\u00a0 When the opposing player has two or less blocks then their sprite will shrink. This is to prevent the player from camping on their tiles.</p>\n<p>Players are initially in their resting state. In their resting state players move faster but they are unable to collide with the ball. When the player holds down space or num pad 0 they turn solid. When players are solid they are able to collide with the ball but they move significantly slower.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>ESC - Reset game</p>\n<p><em>Red Player</em></p>\n<p>W - Move up</p>\n<p>A - Move left</p>\n<p>S - Move down</p>\n<p>D - Move right</p>\n<p>Space Key - Turn solid</p>\n<p><em>Blue Player</em><br/></p>\n<p>Up arrow - Move up</p>\n<p>Left arrow - Move left</p>\n<p>Down arrow - Move down</p>\n<p>Right arrow - Move Right</p>\n<p>0 Number Pad - Turn solid</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/782/782043e7e222ecc332087203ec71e21c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benfangliu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
