In other levels there is more vertically and the paths are getting more narrower so you need to be flexible to be able to push off all barrels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEverytime the player successfully wins the level than his/her best time gets saved to the leaderboards. There is a local best time and a leaderboard time where you can compare your score with other player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33f49b9de04520d0152d861c78374acf.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings", "The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames", "The Code Zone"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
