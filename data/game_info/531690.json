It's up to you if the shell and the axe are going to be found in a very dangerous and strange dungeon that seems to have no ends.</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY - Seek what you must in this Top Down Action-Adventure game\u00a0and try not to die to fulfill\u00a0your duty. You will come across many enemies and obstacles and you will solve many puzzles before reaching your goal...\u00a0</p>\n<p>In making of this game I was inspired mostly by Link's Awakening and its stylized art-style while staying true to the theme of the 2020 Epic MegaJam (This dungeon will seems to have an end, but it will loop you back, so you will never be done with it. But not to worry, the dungeon is massive enough for you to explore, find unique enemies and collectibles, and enjoy the beautiful environments. But beware, each time dungeon loops, enemies will become stronger, but after a long time I am sure you will have better skill at countering enemies). This game was made entirely by me, Timur Sarmanov, in 7 days. I hope you will enjoy this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a19356597bb1d971798f743b70e34c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeroPastaYT"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
