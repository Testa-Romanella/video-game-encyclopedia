They want you to work for them - or rather for Olympus, a mysterious global agency who seems to deal with... magic?\r\n  </p>\n<p>A chain of reactions begins, one that will free a beast of a magnitude you can't imagine, and that awakens the past horrors you tried so hard to forget. How will it influence you? And how will you influence\u00a0<em>it</em>?\r\n  </p>\n<p>In this interactive fiction on\u00a0<em>Twine</em>, you can choose your gender and pronouns, your physical appearance, and your job (art smuggler, private eye, hacker, or street fighter). Choose your answers wisely, and you will have a few allies, plenty of enemies, and even some lovers.\r\n  </p>\r\nThe Romantic Options\r\n  \r\n<ul><li><strong>Louis/Louise ARCHER</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Archer was chosen as the leader of the first tactical team for a simple reason: they never betray their team. Easygoing, charming and fun, their personality shifts completely when they are in \"work mode\"; they turn into an overly serious person, whose mind is solely focused on one thing: their mission.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>They do everything with their heart on their sleeve, and their romance path is just as passionate as they are. When Archer falls, it is hard and fast.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Jay/Jaya MISHRA</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Child of ZEUS, they were promised the title of team leader, until Archer was chosen by the Council unanimously.\u00a0 Mishra's calculated nature is both a blessing and a curse for the team, as no one knows\u00a0how far they are willing to go to win. They're certainly\u00a0not above using their good looks and great\u00a0acting to manipulate others.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Assertive and cunning, Mishra's romance path is full of teasing and tender moments, if you manage to go through\u00a0their cautious nature.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Merlin/Nimue BOTHA</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Although a genius\u00a0first, Botha's skills with a sniper are remarkable and gave them a place in the first tactical team.\u00a0 Their soft and quiet nature makes them a patient hunter.\u00a0 The youngest member of the team, what Botha lacks in combat experience, they more than make up for in knowledge.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In the romance department, however, Botha is denser than the Olympus guidebook. Their romance path is both fun and soothing, although painfully slow at the start.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>NEZHRA</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>The only person in the world who managed to go past Olympus security, NEZHRA got their place on the first tactical team after their successful hacking attempt.\u00a0 NEZHRA is the most mysterious of your team members, as they hide their face and real identity behind their persona of a fun-loving hacker and a literal cartoon. You can only hear their voice through calls, but they do make sure that they are unforgettable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>NEZHRA's romance path is full of mystery, intense realizations, and dramatically hilarious moments.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Rowan SMITH</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Rowan is a thief, and a very good one, as they have become the only one who stole from the agency without going to jail. Although they were\u00a0arrested, their deep knowledge of the art smuggling world gave them an out. Cocky, blunt\u00a0and brave, they walk the fine line between complete asshole and extravagant genius. Their role inside your team, however, is yours to decide.</p>\n<p>Rowan is a character that charms and annoys you at the same time, and their romance path is the same; if you can accept them at their impetuous worst, you might see them at their daring best.\r\n  </p>\r\nGame options\r\n  \r\n<p><em>Olympus\u00a0</em>strives to be a game where you can choose the\u00a0<strong>personality</strong>, the\u00a0<strong>actions,</strong>\u00a0as well as the\u00a0<strong>appearance</strong>\u00a0of the main character.\u00a0Your character has a set past, but\u00a0<strong>you can decide their future</strong>.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0<strong>16</strong><strong>+</strong>, as it deals with issues of\u00a0<strong>violence</strong>\u00a0and has some potential\u00a0<strong>sex</strong> <strong>scenes</strong>.
