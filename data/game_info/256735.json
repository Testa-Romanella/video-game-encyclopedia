The aim is to kill the people coming at you before they reach the end of the screen. If even one of them does, you lose. It consists of 5 levels and can be beaten in about a minute but for me was done as a test to see if I could create anything playable in the small time frame as this is my first game jam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb24a55010bcff5f08f922a6fb871507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AidanColpet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
