You control a tribe of mongrelmen who start with nothing in the savage wilderness huddled around a totem from which\u00a0they spawned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Various threats like humans, kobolds, orcs, the undead\u00a0and wolves lurk nearby, and soon more dangerous enemies (or powerful allies)\u00a0begin to arrive and pose a real threat to the safety of your group.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Gather resources, build a camp, defend your base and go on raids while doing your best to keep your tribe alive!</p>\n\n<p>The game is coded in python with help from libtcod. Player input is almost entirely by mouse with the use of a few hot-keys. Use space bar to pause and hold right-click to move the map around and left-click to select and interact with units. If you are allocating collection jobs then you can hold down left-click and move the mouse to bulk select tasks. Use the rally hot-key when you've selected a unit and the rest of your tribe will follow their lead!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/62610c48a478712eee40e8f4640bb6ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["patjw"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
