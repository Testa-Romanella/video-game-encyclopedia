RPG Maker assets are for RPG Maker use only.Key Features<br/><br/>With Game Character Hub, you can easily create characters by choosing generator parts provided in the program. Simply select a template, add items and you're done! You can also create your own custom templates and parts.

You can pause the animation and change different settings such as the animation speed, background color and even zoom! You can also set custom animation previews with the Animation Management feature. Useful if you want to see if your Autotiles or Behaviour poses seamlessly transition to one another!<br/><br/><br/>With Game Character Hub's palette editor, it's easier for you to create your own palettes and change values. What's more is that you can generate palette colors from all visible layers or specific ones. Great for finding the colors you need!<br/><br/><br/>Tired of manually merging tile sheets on your own?
