Let\u2019s have a look at the valley you live in - entirely covered with them\u2026<br/>It\u2019s a high time you finally hunker down, grab a bin liner and lets your area challenge you - explore it and admire how the view is changing when you take care of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can find rubbish in the forest, by the river or near your favorite lake. You can even fish garbage up from the water.<br/>Hey, it\u2019s great you are excited, but pay attention to the constraints of your body - if you collect too much, you may have a hard time carrying it back home. So, firstly plan it wisely and then, why don\u2019t you buy a car?<br/><br/><br/><br/>How does it feel to be the mane of a change? Go further, be eco and segregate the rubbish you gathered. Paper, plastic, glass - each segregated rubbish is extra money you can make!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes you can find a real treasure in the rubbish - a really rare and valuable object.<br/>What to do with them? One option is to sell it on the market and instead buy new tools, chic furniture for your place or even, buy your own car to scale up your business!<br/>No worries, if you really like something you found, simply keep it and use it to decorate your house. It\u2019s all up to you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Great you decided to take care of your valley, but by now you probably know that it\u2019s not enough to take care of your area. Build bee yards in the forest, buy and build birdhouses and repair hives. Don\u2019t forget to take car elf animals and remove animal traps, make sure you prevent fire and many more.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c221fb770ad1cc3128f05236712c295f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 465, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Movie Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay", "Movie Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
