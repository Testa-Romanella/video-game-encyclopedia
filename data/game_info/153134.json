METU is the Middle East Technical University, and the theme of the game is that you must get to the cultural center before the Global Game Jam starts. Along the way you need to form your team, and (hopefully) find a programmer, artist, and audio expert.</p><p>The game was written in 48 hours at the Global Game Jam at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara by two programmers, a few artists, no audio experts, and an environmental engineer.</p><p>You can also find this game at </p><p>http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/lost-metu</p><p>Some additional notes:</p><p>Once the game has started, there is no way to restart the game without quitting and restarting the game.</p><p>The game played in the Stadium has confusing directions.  You must follow the orders it gives you when the dot reaches the end of the line.  Your goal is to get to the vertical line at the end of the screen.</p><p>You can watch a play through here:</p><p>https://vimeo.com/122145691<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c7462c634e1f78a05027757c10636c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Laaph"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
