It includes interesting activities such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Battle</li><li>Boss battle</li><li>Puzzle solving</li><li>Making choices in speech and action\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>This is a demo that\u00a0brings you around 15 minutes of gaming experience. I have many ideas in mind, so if you guys like it, I will make a full version :D</p>\n\r\nBackground Story\r\n<p>Cyrus\u00a0was a normal secondary student before he fell into a medieval magical world after an explosion in an alleyway where he visited a stray cat every day after school. And slowly Cyrus found out he started to know how to control the flow of air. The intrusion to a mysterious world, however, alarmed The Council, which was a group of wizards that controlled the world. They forced Cyrus to agree to all of the council's\u00a0rules, or else never could he be allowed to go home. The rules, too long, didn't read, like this background story, Cyrus just skipped it, but he was allowed to go back to his own world. After a detention in school, Cyrus head back home, while he and other passengers were surrounded by a tremendous amount of thugs in white clothes. And the story starts here.</p>\n\r\nInspiration\r\n<p>The mission in this demo is inspired from one of the major events in Hong Kong's protest - Yuen Long Attack in 2019. It is only inspired, thus many details have been altered to fit the game's universe (obviously, as no one was using magic or even trying to protect the civilians in the attack). The story and characters are fictional, any similarities are purely coincidence.</p>\n\r\n\r\nKeep Updated\r\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>If you have itch.io installed, click install button, wait for a while and launch the game.</p>\n<p>If you are downloading from the website, unzip the entire folder then click \"Legacy of Datura.exe\" to play.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2aba31f0d732385b87cbe994a7eafc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mighcty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
