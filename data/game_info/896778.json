Compare to the previous game I made, I added sound effects during the interaction to the dialog, and to the enemy sprites. I also re-created all three game levels to make them more smooth to complete, and now the playing experience through each map is going to make more sense, the players move can be more reasonable. I also added movement for the enemy to give the game more challenges. Finally, I tried using story telling like Elden Rings to show pieces of information in each level to give a broad story for the game.</p><p>Hope you Enjoy the game, and if you want, you can also try to play with the old game to compare the differences and provide me some feed back!</p><p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T06:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3c/b3c2b2f2254d038ac6e9111ba11f66c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["llukrex"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
