A simple 8 x 8 grid of colored tiles, or is it?<br/>Tap a color you want to remove, then tap an adjacent color if the path between is clear. If there is any colored tile in between the two you are attempting to remove, it must be removed first. 100 Challenging levels and 4 different game modes, Casual, Pressure, Change Up and Frantic mode,  await you delivering 400 levels of frustratingly enjoyable gameplay! <br/><br/>Casual Mode: <br/>Earn stars for completing levels with a fast finger. Points are calculated according to speed.<br/><br/>Pressure Mode:<br/>5 Seconds. The heat is on! The timer counts down from 5 until a pair of colored tiles are cleared. When clearing a pair, the counter resets. Beware\u2026 your eyes may begin to betray you when they start drifting towards checking the remaining digits on the timer becoming a distraction from diffusing the ticking time bomb! Only a quick wit and strong situational awareness can save you!<br/><br/>Change Up Mode:<br/>Earn stars for completing levels with a fast finger. Points are calculated according to speed, but this time, with a twist! The color of the tiles will change at random intervals increasing difficulty. Just when you think you\u2019ve found the matching tile, it disappears right before your eyes! <br/><br/>Frantic Mode:<br/>This is a combination of Pressure and Change Up game modes. You will have a countdown match timer and the color of the tiles will change at random intervals. Of course, we\u2019ve added a couple extra seconds to the clock\u2026 but that won\u2019t help you! Mwahaha!<br/><br/>Earn your way to 400 gold stars by solving the maze of eye-straining colors as the sweat beads down your forehead. Grit your teeth, squint your eyes and prepare yourself. <br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>* 100 Levels &amp; 4 Game Modes (400 Levels of total game play)<br/>* Casual, Pressure, Change Up and Frantic game modes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c493b826482d11d7db94edf5f5bc26.jpg", "website": "http://www.KillerBytesGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["KillerBytes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brandon Velazquez"], "esrb_rating": null}
