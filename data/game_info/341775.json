Huge corporations control much of the world\u2019s wealth, while sophisticated criminal enterprises scoop up that which remains. Off-world mining has been established and these mega corporations -- some with more revenue than most countries -- now retrieve gold, titanium and other precious metals from moons and asteroids.<br/><br/>LunarCol is \u2013 and has been for many years \u2013 the largest of all the off-world conglomerates. It has a hand in many industries: mining, genetics, and more recently pharmaceuticals. With their Mars-5 base, LunarCol had a permanent presence on Mars. It\u2019s purpose though? Unclear.<br/><br/>Now, the Mars-5 base has gone silent -- no longer responding to hails and only the standard broadcast telemetry from the base being received.<br/><br/>You are TJ Savage, the world\u2019s greatest space investigator and detective. Or at least you were. No one would disagree TJ is the best out there, but as of late, things haven\u2019t quite been going so well.<br/><br/>That last case did not go according to plan. TJ had everything wrapped everything up, he knew who had stolen the plans, and where they had been taken; wrapped everything up apart from one detail, that is. One minor detail: he had got something wrong. <br/><br/>A crisis of faith, and an uncertain future is where TJ finds himself today. And that is where this new adventure begins.<br/><br/>TJ Savage Prologue is the introduction episode to the Space Investigator series.
