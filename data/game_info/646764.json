The game is about making records and beating them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything is different every time. The map is generated randomly. Use good your arsenal to kill monsters effectively. The goal of the game is to reach the largest maze!\u00a0Walking through dark corridors and rooms in search items necessary for survival. The mazes get scarier over time.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is not an easy game. You have to learn how to play!\r\n<br/>\n<p>In another dimension, there are dark corridors filled with monsters and rooms. You will find many weapons and items that are left over from people trying to survive here. Fight and go as far as possible!</p>\n\n\r\nTo get as far as possible, you need to systematically collect ammunition and weapons. By leaving the maze too quickly without checking the room, you leave a lot of ammo behind you. Stay in the maze for too long will also not benefit you, as you will be wasting ammunition.\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMonsters are not sleeping. They move around the maze looking for a living human! They can open doors and attack in groups. After a while, bones lying on the ground will form a skeleton that can tear bones off and throw them at you. Lying half-dead ghouls spit poisonous guts. Gladiators destroy everything in their way! A killed zombie rises from the dead! You must remember all of this, otherwise you will die.\r\nIn higher mazes and difficulty levels, the game is challenging and very dynamic!\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Quickly pull out the weapons necessary to eliminate    the monster and plan your attacks.</em></strong></p>\r\nThe arsenal is not huge, but very diverse. Each weapon works differently!    Player must master the quick drawing of weapons to kill monsters quickly!    Weapons work differently for each enemy!\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nPlay and make a record that no one can beat!\r\n\r\nConnect in-game to Your GAMEJOLT account or play as a guest.
