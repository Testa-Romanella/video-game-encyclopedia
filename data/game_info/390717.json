Tapping the player (the blue box around the player) will result in the player Dashing (small teleport forward), this ability has a brief cool down and can be used mid air or while grounded. Meaning you can use this ability in combinations with the jump and crouch (This will be required to complete later levels).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:26:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/781/7815b40af6019e7fb0485f9759d5f41a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marian Dumitriu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
