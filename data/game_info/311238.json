{"id": 311238, "slug": "pico-nations", "name": "Pico Nations", "name_original": "Pico Nations", "description": "<p><strong>Pico Nations</strong>\u00a0is a small and simple \"strategy\" game. You control a nation of pops and have to build buildings and attack enemies to have the highest score after 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>The map is randomly generated on each new playthrough.</p>\n<p>Pico Nations is a small project that I made to learn PICO-8. It's currently missing sound and music, which I plan to add. I had a lot of fun working on this project and learning how PICO-8 works. I really wanted to stick to the default limitations of the console, so I restricted myself to the limited control scheme, arrow keys and Z/X.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move the selected tile.<br/>Press Z to build a building on the selected tile. What you build depends on the tile.<br/>Press X to rally your pops to the selected tile. This can be used to attack enemy cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>\n<p>Buildings is how you gain new resources and score. What building you build depends on the tile you're building on:<br/>-<strong>Forest</strong>: Builds a lumbermill, costs 5 wood. Gives you a steady income of wood.<br/>- <strong>Plains</strong>: Builds a farm, costs 8 wood. Every two farms increase the maximum population of surrounding cities (max popoulation is 9).<br/>- <strong>Mountains</strong>: Builds a mine, costs 15 wood and 5 gold. Gives you a steady income of gold.<br/>- <strong>Ocean</strong>: Builds a ship, costs 25 wood. Increases you expansion area, allowing you to settle across water. Can be built in expansion area.</p>\n<p><em>Sand is utterly useless.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Settling</strong></p>\n<p>Settling a new city can be done by building on plains outside of your borders but inside the expansion area. Settling requires the nearest city to have a population of at least 3. The first city costs 15 wood to settle. Cost increases with each city.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>Each nation gets a score calculated when the game ends, and the nation with the largest score wins. The factors that contribute to score are:</p>\n<p>- Number of cities, each city is worth 3 score.<br/>- Population, each pop is worth 1 score.<br/>- Gold, each 10 gold is worth 1 score.</p><p>Lexaloffle BBS Link.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4ba3b7a7b6ba0fef5db5b4fa2438fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Gouda"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
