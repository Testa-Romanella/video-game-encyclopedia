I was given 40 hours to make it. I was trying to make something akin to NetHack but ended up wasting alot of time trying to implement 30 year old code written in a different language into this. I will probably come back to this at some point to put in the enemies and option for multiple levels of the dungeon. When the game starts it asks you for login and password, this does not link to anything and anything can be added in to get to the start screen.</p>\n<p>I did not make any of the models or materials I just wrote the code and put the pieces together the assets are free from the unity asset store</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba0/ba0fa897a689be7dfe2a4fb84fbfce6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NightingaleGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
