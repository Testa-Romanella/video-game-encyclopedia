With Fortune\u00a0improving damage rolls and crit rate\u00a0for both you and your enemies, and Blight doing the opposite.<br/><br/>The top of your battle menu displays your current luck stat at all times- this is also your % crit rate.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>This game is played using your mouse.<br/>Attack: Click attack, click your target.\u00a0It's nothing special, but it is your only way to take your foes down. Improves with luck.<br/>Soothe: Restore some health and reduce incoming damage. Improves with luck.<br/>Fortune:\u00a0Increases luck for all actors in battle, improving their damage rolls and crit rate.<br/>Blight: Decreases luck for all actors in battle, lessening their damage rolls and crit rate.<br/><br/>(target yourself with an attack for an.. unintentional easter egg?)<br/><br/>CREDITS:<br/>The battle scene uses\u00a0a modified\u00a0background made by jkjkke<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/background-5<br/>All other art assets are self-made<br/><br/><br/>Never made turn based combat before. It was more work than I\u00a0thought it'd be, so it's rather barebones, but it was a lot of fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82dbf9077421facaa83c82922b8ebc60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElevenStorms"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
