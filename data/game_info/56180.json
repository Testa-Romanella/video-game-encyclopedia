But as Otto, Reggie, Twister, and Sam finally reach the beach, they make a startling discovery--most of the sand is missing, and the surf contest has been postponed. Now it&#39;s up to you to guide the kids through Ocean Shores, The Lakes, The Robot Factory, and Mondo Mountain in the effort to discover who stole the sand. In each area, you&#39;ll battle robot minions, use the new wave runner and zip-line glide, and play extreme sports, such as skateboarding and inline skating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-21T06:40:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7af/7afd83cd70d6d061c045e5a60043554b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Halfbrick", "Evolution Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["THQ"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
