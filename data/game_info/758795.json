This allows you to explore enormous areas while taking very little time to walk anywhere. You'll find that building a mental map of your surroundings becomes impossible. Lines can never stay parallel. Traversing the map can result in unexpected rotations. And many more strange consequences that will make you question reality. You'll also explore spherical space, which has the opposite outcomes. For example, a reverse-perspective: Objects appear larger the farther away they are.<br/><br/>It's a difficult concept to explain, and first-hand experience really is the best way to understand and build an intuition about these interesting geometries. Hyperbolica was created specifically for this purpose, to break the mold and to have a fun experience in an alternative universe different from our own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T06:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41c6bb44c7bf70e2bcbd67ed641db967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CodeParade"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
