But we are not here to bust myths<br/>today, just bricks.</p><p>Remember the Golden Age of the Arcade, around the 1980s or so? It was<br/>a pacman-eat-dot industry, where a game that didn't earn a quarter<br/>every three minutes got removed and replaced. So, the games were built<br/>to have lights and sounds to attract the player, and then to challenge<br/>the player enough that he's likely to lose the game...fast. Still,<br/>from time to time, a player would do really well and get on the high<br/>score list and then type a swearword for his initials or something.</p><p>Buster! is of this type. You cannot blink or you lose! Can you play a<br/>full three minutes? At least you don't have to keep feeding it<br/>quarters....</p><p>This game was a class project for the Udemy course at https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse.</p><p>     Features</p><p>The new (November 2016) Version 1.0 has the following features:</p><p>+ Destroy bricks in a puff of colored smoke</p><p>+ 19 handcrafted levels</p><p>+ 25 backgrounds (bricky-blocky themes are: city, lego, and urban ruins)</p><p>+ 20 songs for background music</p><p>+ Levels/backgrounds/songs cycle for neverending play</p><p>+ Levels ordered according to how long autoplay took to finish them<br/>(75th percentile times).</p><p>+ 15 colors of bricks, four types (1 hit, 2 hit, 3 hit, and unbreakable)</p><p>+ Options menu to change music volume, sound effects volume, and to<br/>switch between mouse and keyboard mode.
