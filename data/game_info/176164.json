Happy Holidays! Whatever holiday you celebrate, here's my little interactive Christmas Card to you. It's a challenging 6 level platformer where you, as one of the four members of the Nerd Overload podcast and radio show must escape a trap set by the dreaded Christmas Creep (who comes earlier every year). It's probably a little buggy (I ran out of time), but I think it's a fun little diversion and I made it for YOU so enjoy it!</p><p>It's free, but if you wanted to donate a few bucks my way I would be eternally grateful-- and the money most likely will go right back into developing more games and content for Nerd Overload!</p><p>Controls are as follows:</p><p>Arrow keys move, Shift jumps. Beware Sticky keys, you can either turn them off in Windows (you should, it's stupid) or you can customize the controls by pressing ctrl+y at any time. You can set up a gamepad from there too if you really want to go nuts. Escape key will close the game, and alt+enter will grant you the powers of full screen.</p><p>There's a secret warp zone hidden in one of the levels too, see if you can find it!</p><p>Also if you came here at random and are wondering who/what/why/how this Nerd Overload thing is, well let me direct you to www,NerdOverload.com. It's a nerd culture/pop culture show and website we do.</p><p>Anyways, enjoy this stupid game, I spent way too much time on it and make sure to have a happy holidays and everything!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Cody of Nerd Overload</p><p>*Credits*</p><p><strong>The whole dang game and all of it's graphics and most of its sounds:</strong></p><p>Cody Pinnick</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>A lot of really old Christmas music midis I found around the net<br/>and also the incomparable Kevin MacLeod of incompetech.com!</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/></p><p>You, for reading this far and taking the time to download this dang thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc498189d358c156678e3753e198d5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nerdoverloadgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
