The project goal was to create a game, with some new/interesting features.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>We decided to make a 2D Platformer, being a very popular genre of game, we had to introduce some diferente features. First we tried to create a interesting story line and them implement some mechanics, that would give the player a different experience, than others 2d Platformers.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>We wanted to introduce some mechanics that would change the way the player approched the levels, giving him different of ways to finish it.<br/>We added diferente colored \u201cwalls\u201d, each would give the player an effect, good or bad, that would help or complicate the players paths.</p>\n\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>As this was a university project, it was recommended to use free assets from the store, here are the ones we used.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\n<p>-Sunny Land (Background)</p>\n<p>-Pixel Adventure 1 (Main Character)</p>\n<p>-Nature pixel art base asstes (Ground/Tile Map)</p>\n<p><strong>Packages</strong></p>\n<p>-Text Mesh Pro (Dialog)</p>\n<p>-Cinemachine (Camera)</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs/Difficulties</strong></p>\n<p>- Player box collider, with tile map collider. Weird bug that makes the player jump, without the command. We tried using a capsule collider for the player, smooths movement but creates another bug, player sometimes cant jump while running fast, because its recognized as being already in the air.</p>\n<p>-We had a problem incorporating more than one dialog section, we had in mind finishing the game with one more dialog between the characters, revealing the plot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1575760206bad4d8de1551f858893004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lPausel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
