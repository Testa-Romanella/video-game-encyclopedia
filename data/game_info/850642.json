I have to sacrifice a lot of elements to finish in time.</p>\n<p>The goal is to split the shape in half. If the split area is within the margin, the difficulty increases.\u00a0Try to successfully split the shape as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This game heavily relies on Delaunay triangulation (implementation thanks to\u00a0https://github.com/RafaelKuebler/DelaunayVoronoi) to create the shape. A custom 2D mesh is created so that I can split it into 2 and calculate the area,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T13:03:18", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danielmakc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
