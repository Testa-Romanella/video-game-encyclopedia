This is a tiny game I\u00a0made in about three weeks. After a bunch of long projects I\u00a0never managed to finish I\u00a0decided to make something I\u00a0could finish. This is the result. A game about firespitting birds, and a goose lighting lighthouses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when I\u00a0first came up with the idea it was nowhere near where it is now. I\u00a0think it begun as me sitting and having nothing to do. So I\u00a0went, alright, what can I\u00a0make in a short time, and that has a tiny scope? A game about boats that are guided by lighthouses seemed like something I\u00a0could do. So I thought what you would actually do, and thought that the lighthouses could be unlit and you would have to light them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I kept going with the idea, and soon I thought of you shooting enemies and lighting the lighthouses to help the boats.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0also thought that full randomly generated would be a cool thing, so I\u00a0added that the todo. Full random generation would be really stupid for this project, it wouldn't really benefit from it at all, no interesting gameplay would happen thanks to it. So I\u00a0went with something way simpler and made simple randomly generated islands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then it just rolled on from there, I\u00a0messed with boids for the enemies, but they didn't really provide anything, so I\u00a0cut everything from that and just used the avoidance for the enemies. Enemies got finished, I\u00a0added the player, added the fires. \"Simple\" as that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then. The beast. Menus. I\u00a0hate UI. It usually breaks immersion, and I\u00a0just don't like dealing with it. It was pretty easy to add in pico8, and I actually enjoyed polishing it up (you can tell I spent wayyy too much time on it heh). The system for switching between menus was not fun though, but it worked.</p>\n<p>A really interesting thing, a friend of mine played the game while I\u00a0was sitting by the side and inschpecting. He went up to the lighthouse and began to shoot at it, not noticing the circle getting larger, that was supposed to show him he was making progress. I\u00a0actually thought before deciding on how to light the lighthouses that you would shoot at it, but I\u00a0decided on the time based style. I think that was dumb, firing at it would be more intuitive and would make it easier for everyone playing the game.
