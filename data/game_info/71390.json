We all grew up playing and learning this classic game from our childhood.<br/><br/>Ludo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four pawns from start to finish according to rolls of a single dice. <br/><br/>Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.<br/><br/>Pachisi originated in India by the 6th century. <br/>The objective of Ludo Ultimate is to be the first to move your four pawn from the base to your home. <br/><br/>Roll a six and race your 4 pawns from start to finish before anyone else can do the same. <br/>Capture your opponent's pawn and send them straight back to the starting area. <br/>When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a pawn already in play, or may enter another staged pawn to its starting square. <br/>Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Hours of fun with this traditional game of Ludo in bright primary colors.
