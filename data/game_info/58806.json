A company specialised in the research, development and application of new technology and science, anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems! As part of our brand-new Save The Day program, you\u2019ll be sent to one of many alien planets in an effort to contribute to Project Assembly, a project I am legally bound to not tell you anything about for fear of our lives. And my job.<br />\nAs an engineer and pioneer, you won\u2019t only be constructing and automating the very factory that will contribute to Project Assembly, but also explore and exploit the planet and its inhabitants as you expand. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re super inclusive when it comes to alien lifeforms! We\u2019ll even allow for pets, how cool is that!?<br />\nJust don\u2019t tell R&amp;D.<br />\nBelow you can find the three main pillars of your mission! Time to get to work, and Stay Effective!<em><br />\n</em>This motto is FICSIT Inc. property. Please do not use ironically.<br />\nCONSTRUCT<br />\nTo achieve company milestones according to satisfaction we expect you to construct your FICSIT Inc. factory in such a way that it allows for easy expansion and complexion. Not only will buildings grow more complex over time, so will the parts they produce. Project Assembly isn\u2019t your average high-school science project. We\u2019re making history here! Go big or go home!<em> Of course, this requires both high-level and low-level power management, good luck getting to nuclear! We even support stuff like multi-floor warehouses so you can stack your buildings, and a whole bunch of navigational constructs like jump pads and walkways! Walkways are the best. They\u2019re attached to the ground and everything.<br />\n</em>Employee will be expected to fund their own travel expenses<br />\nAUTOMATE<br />\nSo you know how your FICSIT Inc. factory can be turned into this incredibly intricate maze of conveyor belts in every direction, merging, splitting, crossing each other above and below? Conveyor belts carry, after all, the life-blood of our company! Well, since you\u2019ll be in a pretty big area you\u2019re going to need outposts. To make your life easier, we\u2019ve developed self-driving trucks and trains so you can set up your very own transport system between any point in your area!<br />\nEXPLORE &amp; EXPLOIT<br />\nR&amp;D hasn\u2019t figured out how to clone materials yet, weirdly enough, so you\u2019re going to have to go out and use our patented method of extraterrestrial pioneering! This means exploring to find more or new stuff to exploit, to help expand your FICSIT Inc. factory. You\u2019re on an uncharted alien planet, so try to be careful, don\u2019t go alone if you don\u2019t have to, and use protection! Who knows what kind of organisms have made this place their home? Or who knows what awesome treasures you\u2019ll find? Don\u2019t worry, this is why we assigned you your very own FICSIT Inc. handler.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ac7/ac7eb85b920f73ea116eca09bea04191.jpg", "website": "https://www.satisfactorygame.com/", "rating": 4.3, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 79, "owned": 1917, "beaten": 72, "toplay": 111, "dropped": 174, "playing": 89}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 261, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 265, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coffee Stain Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coffee Stain Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Rating Pending"}
