Zoutu was a peaceful planet. That is until it was invaded by a powerful being named Venzium. Venzium is a monster who invaded planets with his army of advanced robots who exterminate any living thing that gets in their way and scavenge resources to grow more powerful.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>One day tragedy struck Zoutu. Venzium discovered the planet and proceeded to invade Zoutu. Bombs were dropped and the Venzoids (the robots) invaded and hunted down any Zoutonian in sight. Then Venzium\u00a0 scavenged any resource he could find. He collected any weaponry he could find and left the planet a lifeless warzone.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T10:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/159f713d3f0687f2badffe91755722b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ace"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
