Voth was a miserable place for a colony: perpetually blanketed in fog with a shoreline that never saw the sun. As a bounty hunter, she had other jobs on her plate. But this one came from an old friend-- a father with a missing child. Echoes of the past swirled in her head and she recalled of disappearances in the tight-knit colony. Determined, Eveyln approaches Voth looking for answers-- but sometimes truth is better left unknown.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Character Artis/UI Artistt: <strong>Steven Solorzano</strong></li><li>Concept Artist/Prop Artist/Level Designer: <strong>Connor Capo</strong></li><li>Environment Artist/Level Designer: <strong>David Streng<br/></strong></li><li>Programmer/Technical Artist<strong>: Lindsay Pimentel </strong>| Artstation</li><li>Writer: <strong>Nick Vega</strong></li></ul>\n<p>CSU Fullerton -\u00a0 Art 355C -  Group Project Fall 2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T12:49:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa26ccd200d4adca1d64cf632b827cb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lowpolywog"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
