When poisoned, you go faster (as long as you have coins), but the controls\u00a0are reversed and power ups have a 50/50 chance of backfiring, among a few other things...</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left: A / Left Arrow</li><li>Right: D / Right Arrow</li><li>Jump: W / Up Arrow</li><li>Brake: S / Down Arrow</li><li>Fire:\u00a0B</li><li>Pause:\u00a0Space Bar</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>POINTS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>1st place = 9 points</li><li>2nd place = 6</li><li>3rd place = 3</li><li>4th place = 1</li></ul>\n<p>Score 36 or more points to unlock a SUPER SECRET!</p>\n\n<p><strong>HINTS</strong></p>\n<p>Like Super Mario Kart, there is a boost start trick. Drivers have differently assigned values for acceleration, traction, and top speed.\u00a0I find that Sushi is the best all around driver. For a challenge, try to win with Rilla or Rick. You have infinite lives, so keep playing until you win. Trust me, the super secret pay off is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>All artwork assets were done by me. Atari font is public domain.
