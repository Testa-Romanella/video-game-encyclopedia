So one must make use of her other niche abilities.</p>\n\n<p>Hopping - Well she can't jump, but she can hop, hold z to butt bounce across the floor.</p>\n<p>you can also hop on enemies to kill them without consecutive bounces.</p>\n<p>Climbing - You can climb any vertical surface in the game to reach areas most people could dream of.</p>\n<p>Sleeping - That's right, a passive ability that can be used anywhere regenerate your health when in a pinch, just hold the x button!<br/><br/>This game is a demo, so it's pretty short. But I plan on developing a lot of levels to release it in the future! So be on the lookout for updates in the future. My discord tag is InfernoGaming#9102 and I will be building a YT channel for updates on this game in the meantime!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e164674f234be99cb162e5759b1a79e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGames3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
