Search the abandoned houses for a way to the network's mainframe as you slowly uncover the truth of the tragedy that struck the city years ago, with people turning up missing or dead every single day. Solve puzzles caused by the disrepair of the city and dodge the light as you try to destroy the machine.<br/></p>\n<p>This short (20 min.) horror game was made as part of the 4th RPG maker horror game jam hosted by Beregon. This is not only my first game jam game, it's also my first RPG maker game inspired by the likesof The Witch's House, Ib and Mad Father.
