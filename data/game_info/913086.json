{"id": 913086, "slug": "cat-car", "name": "Cat Car", "name_original": "Cat Car", "description": "<p>This is a 2-button game that also uses a very accessible custom made 2 button dpad for mobile. The 2 big buttons replace the default controls for UP and X. The button with the 2 arrows swaps the 2 big button inputs. On desktop, this button is the Z button.\u00a0By default, the left button controls Car and the right button controls Cat. The other rectangular button is ENTER which brings up the pause menu. The pause menu can be navigated with the 2 big buttons. Use the left button to navigate and right button to make your choice. In the pause menu, you can select 2 modes:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Pizza Mode: Once you reach 10'000 points you make it to Cosmic Pizza\r\n</li><li>Endless Mode: How far can you go?\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>You can also swap your inputs in the pause menu.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>The story:</p>\n<p>Cat and Car are 2 best friends who have traveled the galaxy together. As they were exploring a small desert planet somewhere in the outer rim of the galaxy, they found out that there was a Cosmic Pizza joint just 100 miles 'that way'. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Car dreams of eating the Oil Supreme pizza made with exotic motor oils from across the galaxy. Cat dreams of eating the ultimate extra large Space Tuna.</p>\n<ul><li>Cat rides on top of Car. </li><li>Cat and Car can both jump. </li><li>When Car jumps, Cat is boosted up and can jump really high. </li><li>Cat is able to run on top of clouds and jump off them. </li><li>Car can go through clouds.</li><li>Cat needs to eat stars to maintain jumping energy.</li><li>Car must collect fuel canisters to keep going. </li><li>Cat must also dodge alien birds.</li><li>Car is susceptible to ground obstacles - rocks and holes.</li><li>The last obstacle both must watch out for is a UFO that has fallen in  love with Car. Once in a while UFO appears and zig zags all over the  place and tries to crash into Car. </li><li>Cat can 'punch' UFO away.</li></ul>\n<p>Split second strategy and coordination are required to get to Cosmic Pizza.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every 100 points is a mile. Once you reach 10,000 points, you will arrive.</p>\n<p>THIS GAME IS A WIP, AT THE MOMENT IT LACKS SFX AND MUSIC. I have not yet decided if I'm going to add a music track.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game was made for the Trijam #202 3-hour game jam: https://itch.io/jam/trijam-202. The following gif shows how far I got by the 3 hour submission. I kept working on it and finished it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know in the comments what you think. Let me know if there are any timing issues. As I will be working on SFX and possibly music, I'll still polish up the timing of objects if it needs it. Thank you for playing. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e02ee6e2785a0976cde7c9073beacca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Snow"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
