The English version of this game uses machine translation, so the language quality is relatively poor. If you are concerned, please do not buy it.</strong><br/><br/>Have you heard of parallel time and space?<br/>This story takes place in another parallel time and space of \"<strong> Bahamut 2-Bride of the Dragon</strong>\".<br/>A woman named Celia who lived for more than 3,000 years, she wanted to find her husband Bahamut, but found the sealed Bahamut in Kreer's body. Clear has been trained to be very powerful, so Celia plans to take Clear as a disciple and carry out inhumane training?!<br/>And since everyone around Clear knows that he has Bahamut in his body (only Clear himself does not know it), they exclude him, but make Clear mistakenly think that everyone is afraid of his strength, which makes his personality become aggressive Arrogant, looking down on anyone, until I met Celia...<br/>So... what kind of sparks will happen between a crooked Kreer and a psychopath(?!) Celia who has lived too long?<br/>The same characters have different personalities, and the same story begins with different endings.
