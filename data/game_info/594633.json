You must apply skill and decision making to find the best towers to defend you against ever increasing waves of enemies! The game scales exponentially.</p>\n<p>Each tower has a unique fire pattern and colour modifier. Each colour modifier applies a set effect to the tower no matter what it does. Some modifiers are better on other towers. (See below for guide)</p>\n<p>You gain two gems for every wave you complete. You may choose to sell these gems at the store (press 1) or you may choose to hold on to them (press 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Click - shoot</p>\n<p>WASD / arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Space - buy</p>\n<p>Enter - sell</p>\n<p>E - merge</p><p>Reload to restart the game</p>\n<p><strong>Extra stuff:</strong></p>\n<p>For our fifth ludum dare we went back to our roots. The first game jam we ever did was a tower defense game, and it went terribly. But we're back and better than ever. Our team has grown in size by 2 and we have so much more experience. This was a super fun game jam to do even though we were a bit dead from university. here's to a great next Ludum Dare!</p>\n<p>Tower list</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:15:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63db762f6c78d9645b671b8a72c49980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lee-Pic", "Luther"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
