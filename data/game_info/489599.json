The main goal for project was to develop a small directX 11 engine capable of rendering UI as well as 3D objects.\u00a0 All source code for both the engine and the game can be found at:\u00a0https://github.com/SergioMasson/olc-codejam-2020-voxelmachina.</p>\n<p>The math api as well as input handling were heavily based on the DirectX12 mini engine\u00a0project from Microsoft, that can be found at:\u00a0https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/MiniEngine</p>\n<p>The 3D asserts for the player robot and the enemies where created using MagicaVoxel. The project can be found using this link :https://ephtracy.github.io/</p><p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>- I could no get Direct2D to work with window resizing. This mean that resizing the window will crash the program.
