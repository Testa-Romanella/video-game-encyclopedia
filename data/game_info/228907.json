Non Ishida published three picture grid puzzles in 1988 in Japan under the name of \"Window Art Puzzles\". Subsequently in 1990, James Dalgety in the UK invented the name Nonograms after Non Ishida, and The Sunday Telegraph started publishing them on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>In this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. To solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Later in the solving process, the spaces help determine where a clue may spread. Solvers use a dot to mark cells they are certain are spaces.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T15:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0af02dc39568aa378fda7a0fa050f41_UWYbfUP.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Mobile Dynamix", "Dynamix Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dynamix Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
