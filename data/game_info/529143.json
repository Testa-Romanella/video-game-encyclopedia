But be carefull how you use your ray device because you get only 5 charges, so dont waste them. You can recharge 1 use by picking up a ray bottle.</p>\n<p>The game is made with my own custom 2d game engine that i built with openGL and C++ and this the second game that i make with it and also this is my second game jam.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1af68a02285420295866ada75ba0d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["johnoyo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
