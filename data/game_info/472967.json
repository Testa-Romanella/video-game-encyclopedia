You, Harold, must find the wizard, and defeat him for his treasure!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: (it'll make sense once you play it)<br/></p>\n<p><em>Mouse</em>: Click to move. Click to play a card. Double click to move-to-square.</p>\n<p><em>Keyboard</em>: Numpad OR uio/jkl/m., OR gcr/htn/mwv to move cursor. SHIFT + direction to move Harold. Non-pad numbers to select a card, and Enter or center key (5, k, t) to cast it.</p>\n<p>One thing to mention: definitely press the SPACE BAR to toggle areas of influence for all monsters -- that way you won't get caught unawares.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>:</p>\n<p>Fight the monsters with your card abilities.</p>\n<p>You have some movement points each turn. Once you spend them, your turn is OVER. The monsters move, and you draw a new hand of five cards.</p>\n<p>Each turn, you get three manas (blue circle, upper right). Cards cost manas to play.</p>\n<p>You start the game with six HP. Don't get hit!</p>\n<p>Monsters may have defense / strength / etc that affect how much damage they do.
