A century later, a discovery was made that turned their theory into reality - plunging mankind into an interstellar space race to claim the ultimate prize: the Voidshards.<br/><br/>The events of Excubitor are set in the year 2182, in a remote star system colonized by humans. At its heart is the Baphomet - a vast \u2018hyper-giant\u2019, a star over a thousand times larger than our own sun and one of the biggest stars known to humanity. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of planets orbit the giant star, with many more swallowed up as Baphomet grew larger during its stellar evolution. All around the system, a strange and powerful element is scattered across the many worlds. An element that could provide humanity with all the energy it will ever need. An element that takes the form of blue crystals known as the Voidshards.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2016-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0ab42e601b1665be5924d70d0f2b9edf.jpg", "website": "http://excubitorgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 46, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tesseract Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kasedo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
