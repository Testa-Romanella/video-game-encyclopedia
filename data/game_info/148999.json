Your \r\nministers are your eyes and hands in the realm: assign them to an \r\noffice, give them a budget and let them get their hands dirty. They will\r\n tell you how things are going and give you advice. There is a risk, \r\nhowever, in this off-hand management\u2026 Perhaps the welfare of Babylon is \r\nnot the first item on your ministers\u2019 agendas. Take care of Babylon, but\r\n take care of yourself as well!</p>\n<p>This game experiments with procedural text generation to implement a \r\ncompletely character-driven interface. All information is channeled \r\nthrough the subjective and biased perspective of the advisors, and all \r\nactions are carried out by their proxy. This shifts the focus from the \r\nall-powerful direct management to the messy realm of politics as players\r\n need to grapple with imperfect information and competing interests.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be0d9be5359eb6bfd5e5b3cda7505cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LabLabLab"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
