Your gun is the only thing that can kill the undead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWatch your bullets, reload your weapon before any zombie reachs you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZombies are very strong, 3 to 4 hits usually will kill you, watch out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a classic First Person Shooter ( FPS ) game with pixelated ( low poly ) graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't attack zombies desperately, if they didn't detect you reload you gun and shoot when you see the undead in your sights. The apocalypse is coming now, don't hesitate to shoot anything that moves around you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level has a specific number of undeads to be killed. Hold your weapon firmly and them. Kill undeads separately, it's easier this way. If two or more zombies see you, run for your life. Don't let any invader attack you, get all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is an offline FPS game, it's only you against the AI ( artificial intelligence ), it's not possible to play against your friends, I mean, no multiplayer option.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf an undead strike and do not hit you, this is an excellent opportunity to go away and reload your ammunition. If you with full ammunition, counter attack them immediately. Pull the trigger as fast as you can. You need to survive at any cost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame features<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Nostalgic and classic gameplay<br/>\r\n- Don't forget to reload your weapon", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/59731820a9827e74c94e9e96e0c96f59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 105, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabio Cunha"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fabio Cunha"], "esrb_rating": null}
