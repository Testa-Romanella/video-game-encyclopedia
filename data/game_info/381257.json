In Sol Defender, you man the last ship capable of repelling the invasion of Earth's solar system, Sol. Defend the Earth and then take the fight to the aliens over Mars, Jupiter, and other locations throughout the Sol system. Use power ups to get an edge over your enemies and survive the alien onslaught. Then after the Sol system is saved, play again but this time in Hardcore Mode. No checkpoints, one-hit deaths. This is the way the game was meant to be played. Are you up to the challenge?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fedb18f1ff9413cad106dbd427052bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89 Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
