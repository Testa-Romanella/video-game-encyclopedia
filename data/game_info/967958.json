If disable suspected tags is checked in the game menu, two operations can cancel the tags.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLeft click on the number: The operation is effective when the number of marked mines in adjacent cells is equal to the number in that position, which is equivalent to one left click on all unopened blocks around that number. Clicking is invalid when the mine is not fully marked. If there are mislabeled landmines around the numbers, the game ends.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOctober 17, 2023<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOfficial version<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMay 5th, 2020<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdded a hexagonal plate on top of the original square plate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOctober 1, 2023<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOfficially launched, adding traditional modes, hexagonal variants, and octagonal plates", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T04:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cefedee53fc833ace38cccaafdabc95a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["koyomogi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["koyomogi"], "esrb_rating": null}
