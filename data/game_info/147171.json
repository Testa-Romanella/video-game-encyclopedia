The theme was \"mad-libs\" and our group was given the line, \"Lumberjacks would be much more dangerous if they were highly venomous.\"<br/>This game features a tree that seeks to avenge its fallen brethren, who fell victim of the poisonous lumberjacks. The player controls the tree and fights waves of the lumberjacks, shooting pine needles, pine cone bombs, maple syrup puddles and more. </p><p>Developed in November 2014</p><p>Design/ Art and Animation : Natalie Orlando and Noah Hughes<br/>Programming: Adam Gurman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4929e2343b08c13c138b63e618d03c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Natalie Orlando"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
