Right in front of me! I'd say girl, but she had wings and horns - not to mention she could fly! I'm pretty sure she's not human...<br/>I mean, she drank a load of my cum, calling it a taste test! Apparently she liked it enough to offer for us to form a \"contract\". Uhh... I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do here...<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0Heroine <br/><br/>Name: Lillia <br/>Race: Succubus <br/>Age: Approximately 300 years old <br/>Favorites: Semen (can survive on human food too) <br/>Physique: A bit on the small side<br/><br/>Racial traits: Lillia hails from a species that form contracts with mortals in order to secure a stable supply of nourishment. Ejaculating to this type of succubus does not lead to death. While they can fly and use teleportation and restraint magic, their physical strength is no greater than that of an ordinary person. When selecting humans, they care little about physical appearance and place full emphasis on the flavor of the cum produced. As they do not understand human concepts of love and affection, they prefer purely physical relationships.<br/><br/>Personality traits: She's usually the one in control, but has a slight case of tunnel vision. She is fully aware that her appearance is considered attractive by human standards, and is thus confident in her ability to captivate men.<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0Release notes<br/>Ver.1.2.0 First edition on Steam", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T04:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b063f905ec0627c4affc66e92ff9dddb.jpg", "website": "https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Noki-Studio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noki-Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noki-Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
