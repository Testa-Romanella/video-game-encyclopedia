{"id": 103048, "slug": "tmo", "name": "TMO", "name_original": "TMO", "description": "<p>TMO: Tiny Multiplayer Online (Sim) <br/><br/>You're the game designer of a new and exciting MMO! <br/><br/>MMO players are a demanding species. <br/><br/>They will want awesome quests to set them on their way. Thrilling battles with ferocious baddies. And after they've slain the beasts they will have many a trinket and treasure, so make sure there's a shop nearby where they can sell their bounty. <br/><br/>Your boss said you have complete control over the MMO World. Huzzah! There was one *tiny* limitation however: because of \"technical reasons\" it needed to fit on a single screen. <br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>Instructions: <br/><br/>- Players go from NPC -&gt; Monsters -&gt; Shops -&gt; Back to NPC. <br/>- Click to select the room type below then click on the grid to place the room. <br/>- Rooms build from the clicked cell towards up and right. <br/>- Rooms have different shapes, although they are not shown until you place them. Tip: Reference the game's screenshot for room sizes. <br/>- There is no delete room feature, so plan ahead! <br/>- Players receive happiness if their needs are met. Likewise they will rage quit when they are not. <br/>- Players receive a penalty if they are fighting monsters below their level (indicated by the number on them). <br/>- Players get upset when they are waiting or travelling long distances <br/>- Red players = unhappy players. <br/>- Happy players grant Ratings which brings more players which in turn grants a higher cash income. <br/>- Cash is obtained via monthly subscriptions. More Online users = more cash per month. <br/><br/>- Win the game by getting a Rating of 100 <br/>- Lose the game by getting a Rating of less than 0 <br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>Troubleshooting: <br/><br/>If you're not seeing the UI update your Unity Web player plugin (created with Unity 4.6) or download the standalone versions. <br/><br/>The new Web player is currently unsupported in 64bit OSX on Chrome, see the discussion here: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/no-more-web-player-support-in-chrome-and-firefox.202063/page-4. Try another browser or download the standalone versions. <br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>Tools / Libraries used: <br/><br/>Unity 4.6 <br/>Photoshop <br/>BFXR <br/>Otomata (Generative Music Sequencer) <br/>A* Pathfinding Project <br/>FSM Finite State Machine from wiki.unity3d <br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>Post Comp Update: <br/><br/>v0.1.1 All of which are usability fixes: <br/><br/>* Added visual preview of room size (the most asked for feature) <br/>* Added white border to show currently selected room <br/>* Improved sound volume <br/><br/>Many many more improvements planned. <br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>http://twitter.com/aaronjbaptiste </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d8b9e726205af71ce3d28a94ab7572c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["aaronjbaptiste"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
