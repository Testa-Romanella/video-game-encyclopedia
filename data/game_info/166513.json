I will be starting a full time app development job in January and for the last few weeks while I've had this job lined up it's been harder and harder to put in time on Words to Live By. So I am taking this as a sign that I should take a break. I may return to the project or I may not.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I'd like to thank everyone that supported the project, tried it, gave feedback, etc. I still believe strongly in the game concept but I'm feeling like I don't have the single minded focus it takes to complete a long term solo project.
