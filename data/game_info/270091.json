It has several maps. The first, to reach the goal line avoiding the obstacles in the shortest possible time.<br/>The second, you have to arrive in the shortest time going through the flags (the red ones on the outside, the green ones on the inside) if you make a mistake you will add 10 seconds to the time.<br/>To move, use \"ad\" or arrows. The boats move that way because I wanted to simulate the movement when you row.<br/>I hope u like.<br/>Any comment is well received.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/beed73311b73b1dd951b2fe756eb1d89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cbrettim"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
