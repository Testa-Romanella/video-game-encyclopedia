You will need to choose wisely and pick a unit you think is worth more or equal to $1000 (I used the average prices I could find online for these items). Before you can price check your unit, bidding on the unit will commence, but not in the traditional sense. One of the other cast members will attempt to vigorously shove you off a cliff in order to obtain the unit themselves!</p>\n<p>A parody of the show Storage Wars/Storage Hunters for the TV Game Jam 2019.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>E - Open container/Shove</p>\n<p>NOTE: You are only able to open the container the guy is gesturing towards, ill make that more clear in another update.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 1:</p>\n<p>- Added text prompt for opening the shutters<br/></p>\n<p>- Added various sounds</p>\n<p>- Added means to quit game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad73fcb6bb0767c77cc1a1c53d64c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DomainofPicasso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
