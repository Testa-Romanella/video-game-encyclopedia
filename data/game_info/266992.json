All 1v1 modes can be played against a Player or Computer.</p><p>The colors are similar to elements, you can make different combos and achieve different effects. Some terrain gets colored by your attacks\u00a0and then it\u00a0also exhibits the properties of that color.</p>\n<p>There are several game-modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Training - for those who insist on knowing what they're doing</li><li>Volleyball -\u00a0simple mode without combat, for\u00a0fun (you still lose if you die though)</li><li>Pit fight - Series of NPCs to fight, with increasing difficulty</li><li>Matches, battles - The meat of the game, arena fights in different varieties</li><li>Base survival, Tower climb - Very experimental and not really done.</li><li>Testing World - what it says on the tin, for testing and debugging</li></ul>\n<p>This is a public Alpha test. All\u00a0you see is glorious programmer art, so nothing final. You\u00a0can expect some bugs, although they happen very rarely. Also note that while the game can be played on keyboard, most of them don't support as many simultaneous button presses as you would like, so controller is very recommended. If your controller doesn't seem to be working, you can try the\u00a0Xbox 360 Controller Emulator. The prompts in Training are currently always for X-Box controller.</p>\n<p>!If the menu sounds seem loud, turn down your volume, they are quiet compared to the game. No in-game volume slider yet, sorry!</p>\n<p>The speed of the game can be adjusted in Other Settings.</p>\n<p>Facebook Page:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/PEBBLESgame/</p>\n<p>Youtube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEeg1GkERn6zcVuIghwxag</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c11ca33e1b07ab21f431f2d8ce17170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johny Daison"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
