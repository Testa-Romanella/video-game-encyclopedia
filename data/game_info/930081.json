Credits will be listed at the ending.</p>\n<p>This project is very similar to Heaven Saga, but this is more like a small spin-off of it. And no, this is not a foreshadowing or an early leak of the new build. The entire plot was made up by me. This game is developed exclusively for Gandi IDE\u2019s Scratch Game Jam #1. You can check out more games here:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/scratch-game-jam-01/entries</p>\n<p>The game follows Sonic as he dashes through a soggy place in a rainstorm, and then he picks up the Eternal Sword of Japan, while his mission is to defeat the strong and aggressive demon for good, in return for his reward of extended live span from an Angel of Heaven.</p>\n<p>This game is short, but the ending will leave you impressed. The 2nd boss is a bit hard to defeat, though, but you'll learn the patterns eventually.</p>\n<p><strong>This game uses a lot of cool noises and stereo sounds! Headphones are recommended!</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>- Move: Arrow Keys<br/></p>\n<p>- Jump: A</p>\n<p>- Spindash: Down arrow + A</p>\n<p>When on the 2nd boss, with Sonic flying, use A, S, or D to use certain attacks. And once you took out the demon, spam a certain assigned key when you're deflecting an attack or charging up.</p>\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed my game! Have fun.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>All credits are at the ending.</strong></p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p><em>This game uses a song from an Anime show.</em></p>\n<p>Name:\u00a0Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba [From the Edge]</p>\n<p>By FictionJunction feat.
