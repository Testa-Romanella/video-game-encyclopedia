{"id": 656966, "slug": "robot-rush-serdetay", "name": "Robot Rush (Serdetay)", "name_original": "Robot Rush (Serdetay)", "description": "<p>Robo Rush is a game where you need to control some chaotic robots to destroy your foes. You will have robots which are dedicated to different jobs like hacking, fighting and so on. You need them to cooperate if you want to win, though it will not be easy. You will control your chaotic and sometimes kind of dumb robots while under pressure. You will nervously look at your timer, you will \"Try To Manage That Chaotic Traffic\".\u00a0 The game\u00a0fits the theme by making you, dear player, feel chaotic. It tries to make every single robot chaotic. It \"underinforms\" you so you feel tense and thus, chaotic. It forces you to create chaos by spawning robots (which causes traffic). Many can argue this is not the best aproach to the theme, which is true, but at least game is fun and it succeds, at making you feel chaotic. So i think it fits the theme in a fine way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T01:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7b4bdaa332cd9fba2cbd7f8e6be728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serdetay"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
