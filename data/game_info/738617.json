No Downloads Needed.]<br/></em></p>\n<p>Easy Mode: Collect all Neat Coins in each level to open the exit portal. Go to the portal to get to the next level.</p>\n<p>Hard Mode: Collect all pickups in each level and then finish the level. It turns out Captain Neat-O doesn't mind vegetables, but hates CHICKEN! Go figure! 30 years later, maybe he's vegan now.</p>\n<p>If you don't feel like finishing the levels or get stuck, feel free to skip levels by pressing +. You can even skip to the end and see what happens. I don't mind :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>For TOY BOX JAM 3. Thanks MAX and friends! I had fun.</p>\n<p>The aim was to qualify for the HARD MODE, but the font assets were too tricky to import in Unity, and I wanted to stick to the fun. So fonts look like PICO-8, but I actually downloaded a 3rd party TTF file. OOPS! DISQUALIFIED \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>Hope you all enjoy.</p>\n<p>Best,<br/>Sam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f496afe0be54fab56914d7bdb9b72da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["thisisneat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
