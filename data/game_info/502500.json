If you wish to join me and watch as this game grows, I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>\n<p>This page will be updated with more info as more of the game is done.</p>\n<p>NOTE: In the demo, press F7 to remap gamepad controls and F8 to remap keyboard controls. There will probably be more ways to access control remapping in the final version. This game can only be\u00a0controlled by keyboard and\u00a0Xbox controllers\u00a0by default.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:19:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c8/2c8cf93512982f5d98bde19cf2f5fd65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Happy Frog Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
