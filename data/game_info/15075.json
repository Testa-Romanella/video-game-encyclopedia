Roaches, of course! And they will fight for their survival with other insects too. Thankfully, radiation gives everything superpowers! Well, in most cases. You are a tiny irradiated roach that can now fly. But can you fly fast enough to escape the fleas?</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>RADical ROACH Deluxe Edition is a typical rendition of side-scrolling games, where the player-controlled character is placed in the left part of the screen and obstacles and enemies come from the right side with the players being able to move up and down. </p>\n<p>Players control a small roach that did not only survive the nuclear war but also got superpowers, thanks to the radiation. Fly away from the enemy fleas, which are now deadly. As the players fly away from their enemies, they also have to avoid fast approaching obstacles, touching which will result in a one-hit kill, as well as other fleas, that overtook you.</p>\n<p>The game features an upgrade system, which allows the players to upgrade the tiny roach by improving its speed, getting several lives. It is also possible to change the skin of the roach that better suits the player&#39;s taste.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T08:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93ca2e6654260a43fa89b4e02d6ee5dc.jpg", "website": "http://decayinglogic.com/", "rating": 1.62, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 1166, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 47, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 47, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Decaying Logic"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
