I mean, why settle for serenity when you can unleash an arsenal of high-powered warheads and destroy every planet in the universe? Take that, faraway civilizations!<br/><br/>Destructamundo is a game of chain reactions and massive explosions. Set off a warhead and watch the fireworks as you cause as much widespread damage as possible by setting off long, winding combos that reach throughout the cosmos. Destroy an entire planetary system in a single shot (or, if you\u2019re not so cunning, destroy it in a couple of shots). Why would you do such a horrible thing, you might ask? For shiny gold medals, of course! Well, that and the survival of your species, but that\u2019s decidedly less important.<br/><br/>Not enough info for you?
