Therefore, it might contain heavy topics not suitable for everyone.</strong><br />\nFEATURES<br />\nExplore a vast tech tree to discover and install new modules into your station to entice \u201cPremium Customers\u201d. Each of these characters will bring with them a new and eye-opening narrative for you to interact with and influence.</p>\n<p>Example Modules**:<br />\nOrgan vending Machine (Lab-grown, no free-range organs here)<br />\nArtificial Womb (Please keep your receipt to receive the correct baby)<br />\nCloning Booth (Four hands are better than two)<br />\nMemory modification (Who needs regrets when you can erase them in a snap?)<br />\nSmart toilets (We\u2019ll let you figure that one out)<br />\nTeleportation (One-way tickets only)<br />\nPlus, many more!<br />\nEach day you will need to report your store\u2019s earnings and rating to the world\u2019s first AI (and subsequently, the owner of Flat Eye and its parent company).
