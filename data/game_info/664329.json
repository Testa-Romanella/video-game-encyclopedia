I am using a method called static waypoint evalutation where I evaluate the waypoints the bots use to move before the game begins to find data such as the connections between them, the lines of sight between them as well as pinch points and good ambush points. I then use this data in game in order to make decisions regarding where the bots will go or what will they do.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:56:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/155/155094087f3c303e7d7166ef93e82724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FruitPunchSamurai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
