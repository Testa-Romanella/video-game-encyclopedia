Join the Ookas, Ooka Bing and Ooka Ping, on their journey as they gather the Great Bananas! With the two together they can assist each other into getting to places they normally couldn't, or together solve a puzzle!<br/><br/><strong>Local Co-op</strong> : Join Ooka Bing and Ooka Ping as together they solve puzzles! A person controls either Ooka Bing or Ooka Ping and work together to complete the level!<br/><br/><strong>Flexible Controls</strong> : Take control of Ooka Ping or Ooka Bing, either using gamepads, or with the mouse and keyboard! Gamepads are recommended but the game works perfectly fine with only 1 mouse and keyboard! A combination of gamepad and keyboard is possible!<br/><br/><strong>Casual Fun</strong> : The Ookas's Adventure, though an important one, is a fun one! The game is a puzzle platformer, but time limits are not in play! Take your time to learn the levels and then execute once you're ready!<br/><br/><strong>Remote Play</strong> : If using remote play it is recommended for the connecting player to use keyboard controls to avoid general input lag. If gamepads are drifting more than usual or not working correctly, try disabling steam input.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T08:03:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/2185576a8d80d0edf00cdf484d9979fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daemin N"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Daemin N"], "esrb_rating": null}
