They throw spells at each other trying to make the oposing faction get demolished by the giant swirl or get blasted off the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Battle of Oljwa is a little project made for the 2019/1 discipline of Game Contents, in the Digital Games class of the\u00a0Universidade Franciscana, in Santa Maria, Brazil. We were designated to analyze two mythologies (Basque and Inuit), see what is similar between them, then make a third one based on those similarities.</p>\n<p>We created the so called Agenflewi mythology, with its own myths, beliefs and language. From\u00a0that, we needed to make a game that incorporated an important part of our mythology, and that is how Battle of Oljwa was born.</p>\n<p>Interested people who want to know more about, send a email to guilhermelrmoreira@gmail.com and I'll be happy to send you a full article about this.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Menus - Space</p>\n<p>Seagulls - W, A, S, D</p>\n<p>Snails - Numpad 8, 2, 4, 6</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Guilherme Moreira (guilhermelrmoreira@gmail.com)\u00a0- Design, Programming and Sound</p>\n<p>Pietro Athayde (pietroathayg@gmail.com) - Art</p><p>Made with Game Maker Studio 2, Aseprite and BFXR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/601d406715440832d5b3a9ab080b1ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["guinub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
