You play as one of these pilgrims set off on a journey through various villages in the south of France. The game is like a contemplative and informative walk in which you meet different typical places and peronnages. Like a real pilgrim, you have a notebook that you will fill with tampons, proof of your passage in some cities.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:37:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e4923bb62a94da7db377236cc779b7f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Val\u00e9rian CHORGNON - 2D Artist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
