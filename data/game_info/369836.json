Throughout this period, the rogue god sends hordes of his minions to destroy the world. His malevolence has a great influence on the weather, spawning pockets of tropical oasis in normally frigid climates and storms of snow and ice in arid regions.</p>\n<p>The world is rich with lore and immersive environments where countless treasures lie undiscovered. Compelling story lines and narratives motivate the player to discover their true destiny which ultimately is to save the world and become gods themselves.<br/></p>\n<p>Game's website:\u00a0Embers of the Gods<br/></p>\n<p>Game's Facebook:\u00a0Fortune Game Studio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:19:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bd048059d12d8dfb5d8a3aa451adc89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevRick"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
