During the summoning ritual, they made a mistake and raised the dead, while turning themselves into zombies.<br/>Now you have to return home by jumping to other worlds through portals, all while making your way through the hordes of the undead.<h3>What's the game all about?</h3>It's a simple campaign-style, third-person shooter.<br/>Shoot zombies and other monsters to move to other worlds. Defeat all the bosses guarding the portals.<br/>As you progress through the game, look for new weapons and hidden ammo. Use them sparingly:<br/>it's not so easy to beat the undead in combat.<h3>Will the project continue to be developed?</h3>Free updates will be released. I plan on making additions with new locations, enemies, and weapons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T18:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54c40ffe521fa6fbb17c28865d5c50ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 581, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Satur Cat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Satur Cat"], "esrb_rating": null}
