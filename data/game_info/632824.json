I had dreams of making cool games and selling them to make fat wads of cash. As it turns out, I was delusional and most of my games were complete trash.</p>\n<p>In Cucumber Racing (formely known as\u00a0Match Box Racing), I try and create something in the racing genre. This was probably inspired by Micro Machines V3, because I used to like that game. Unlike that game, however, this is complete trash.</p>\n<p>Why are there two finish lines? How did I manage to complete a circuit and increase the number of laps I had to complete? Why do I get stuck on walls? Why did I create 36 sprites for each racer, each at a different angle, instead of just...setting the sprite angle? How is this game so bad? And how the hell does the AI work?</p>\n<p>Now you too can see my humble beginnings. They truly are humbling. I added the terrible music for the Game Breakers Toolkit jam though. That wasn't there originally.</p>\n<p>Also this doesn't have any resolution management or anything so it probably looks like trash.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T06:41:47", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Edward Atkin"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
