The game was made under the given theme of \"Less is More\" and because of that we chose to use the least amount of pixels to make a readable image, therefore all sprites and tiles in this game are in 8x8 form and to fit the theme with a game mechanic, the goblin has to retrieve the items to the dungeon instead of taking them and overloading yourself with items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please leave a comment</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We are a new team and this is our second game ever so we ask you to please leave a comment with feedback on the game as we are trying our best to learn.</p>\n<p>Thanks for anything!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD -&gt; Move</p>\n<p>J -&gt; Attack</p>\n<p>I -&gt; Interact</p>\n<p>Esc -&gt; Back to Start Menu</p>\n<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>\n<p>- Eduardo Ferrari</p>\n<p>- Francisco Weltman</p>\n<p>- Gabriel Felberg</p>\n<p>- Gabriel Teixeira</p>\n<p>- Jean Gatin</p>\n<p>- Lorenzo Holanda<br/></p>\n<p>- Rafael Braga</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/8315a23a27d01f78a71163d7f3cae0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The_Hat_Guy", "weltmano", "Murisocrates"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
