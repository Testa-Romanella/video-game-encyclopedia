The only way to get stronger is by exploring and finding skills, crafting recipes, etc... Monsters only drop crafting materials.<br/><br/>2- This game deals with small numbers...you won't be dealing hundreds of damage....so you can have more control over the battle and prepare yourself more strategically. Even your items are limited and can only be refilled at your home base.<br/><br/><br/>The story is like this: Each area (continent) of the world is ruled by one phanteon of gods and angels from mithologies and religions from our world (Nordic, Cristian, Hindu, Egyptian and Greek). All Deities lived in harmony, but suddenly all of them became corrupted and they wiped out most of the population of the world. So now you have to go around the world and try to find the few survivors that still exists and find out what happened<br/><br/>The demo contains the 3 first areas completed. It should end after you beat the third boss...<br/><br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it, and please give me feedback on anything that I can improve</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T03:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee2/ee26e9ac554cf09dab748b746d33b158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diego Binder"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
