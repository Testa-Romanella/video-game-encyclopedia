The goal is to keep your pawn alive and destroy other players\u2018 pawns at all costs. Each player has a trusty laser for all their destruction needs, but the environment itself offer great ways of disposing of the opposition. And if that\u2018s not enough - throughout the whole game it rains of metal boxes containing mighty powerups to spice up the gameplay! Just watch out... you wouldn\u2018t want one of those containers falling on your pawn. They\u2018re heavy you know!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Left stick controls the pawn, right stick controls the laser!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:<br/></strong>Currently there's a single game mode in which all players battle it out in a First to 5 Last Pawn Standing match.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This game requires at least two gamepads!</strong></p>\n<p>This is an early version of the game.
