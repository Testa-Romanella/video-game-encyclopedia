The original arcade game version used an unusual screen setup that situated one display in between projected images of two other displays, creating the appearance of a triple-wide screen. Versions of the game were subsequently released for a variety of home platforms, including various personal computers, and were mostly well received. A remake known as The Ninja Warriors Again was developed by Natsume and released for the SNES in 1994.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T00:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a18e7226a8796398fbd3ad4577d2b97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "Wii", "Atari ST", "PlayStation 4", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
