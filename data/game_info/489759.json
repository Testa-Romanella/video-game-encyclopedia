I'm new to the Visual Novel industry and decided to try my hand at creating one. This Visual Novel is about a prince who is banished into a portal, ending up in our modern day world (definitely not 2020). He tasks himself to find his childhood sweetheart who fell into the portal as well. But our hero's task is not so straightforward. He has to deal with college, teenage girls, jocks and teachers with an agenda.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the story sounds interesting please give it a try. I am doing all the designing and coding on my own now using free sprites and products. With more donations , i would be able to afford an artist and provide updates with better graphics.</p>\n<p>The second chapter is now out! While the second chapter is mostly story telling, the third chapter will be when you have more options as a player.\u00a0 The interactive map as well as more attributes will be available.</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/necropolis242</p>\n<p>Thank you and regardless of whether you try the game, i hope you stay safe,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/219/219673b29df1e323fe02b1bf00318af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["necropolis242"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
