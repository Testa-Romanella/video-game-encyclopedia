By filling this journal with your memories you will allow some of your greatest feats\u2026 and failures\u2026 to live on.<br/><br/>You do remember how your life story went... don\u2019t you?<br/><br/>***********************************************<br/>Praise from the Beta Testers:<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got a solid hit for a contender!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;I played the crap out of it last night and had a good time&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;combining CYOA with RPG and CCG is really awesome!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;absolutely love the game&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;Excellent gameplay, fantastic story&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;neat way to get younger people to read more!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>- &amp;quot;REALLY enjoyed the game!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>***********************************************<br/>Best described as a hybrid of choice-based interactive fiction, a deck-building card game, and a solitaire table-top roleplaying session.<br/><br/>You&amp;#39;ll make important story decisions, roll dice to test your abilities, collect weapons, magic, and companions to be used in a card game that will reveal the outcome of your most devastating encounters!<br/><br/>Key features that make Heroes Guard different from most interactive fiction titles:<br/><br/>+ Card-Battle System: Use the magic, weapons, and companions gathered through the story to defeat powerful foes. Perhaps you&amp;#39;ll squash that giant spider with your war hammer or perhaps it&amp;#39;s a better idea to blast it from afar with a fireball? Your choice, your strategy!<br/><br/>+ Dynamic Short-Stories: Adventure on an interactive map with random events. Each event is a short-story that will put your strength, dexterity, intelligence, and charisma to the test! Careful, as each short-story can escalate if left unattended and eventually will consume the towns you are meant to protect. <br/><br/>+ Life Chronicle: In Heroes Guard you are a old, weathered adventurer recalling all his past feats. Perhaps you rose to power as a commander in the guard, or perhaps you lost it all and ended up as a beggar on the streets?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd267c10dfc8324163b3d1ba1ea1b39a.jpeg", "website": "http://www.underbytestudios.com/heroes-guard", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Under Byte Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Under Byte Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
