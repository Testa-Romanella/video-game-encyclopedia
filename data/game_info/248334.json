After witnessing an ominous eclipse, the animals become violent and plants become sentient. The High Priest predicts an unnamed Calamity, the end of the Incan empire.<br/>Along the way you join your best friend, Grey, a lowly herbologist from your empire, and Llullialaco \"Lily\", a maiden you saved from being sacrificed, to try and save your people.<br/>Explore Tawantinsuyu--the four regions of the Incan empire--and the cultures they absorbed. Sites include the Nazca Lines, Macchu Picchu, Cajamarca, and many other ruins. Traverse wandering dungeons and prepare for threats at any moment with over 50 unique enemies and over 10 locations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Includes 99% custom artwork and music!</p>\n<p>Starting off you can equip 4 techniques/auras in battle, eventually growing up to 10. Choose your abilities wisely.</p>\n<p>To counter any frustration the player may feel, battles not only hand out stat BITS, but useful ingredients for crafting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore the luscious forests, deserts, and mountains to collect various ingredients. Use these to make weapon items, weapons, armor, accessories, medicine, and more! The Incas had no money, only trading, so this is a necessity, however you won't have to craft everything if you find the right people to trade with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like with our previous game, there is no leveling. The new streamlined menu allows you to choose where your stats are allocated: a new ability, a new weapon, or your own strength?</p>\n<p>Recruit the Incan gods and undercover the ones aiming to destroy the empire!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0abfa76a4d32493728782951404c98bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2BitsLP"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
