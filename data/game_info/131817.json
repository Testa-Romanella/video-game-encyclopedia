Time is running out, grab the bow, aim for it and...shoot!.<br/><br/>Two modes are available:<br/>1.Normal mode: Simply deliver all the items using your bow &amp; arrow, it's quite relaxing.<br/>2.Word mode: Each round a word is given, and its fragments will be in the air. Check the word fragments and deliver exactly what the rabbits need. This mode gives more challenge compared to the normal mode.</p><p>Update 1.2.115</p><p>Performance optimization.</p><p>Added exit button in toolbar</p><p>Minor bug fixes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16776346d8929da368d200e6f7c47076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["CalmCat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
