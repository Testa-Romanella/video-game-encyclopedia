There is no set \u201cplot\u201d or path that the players\u2019 characters must follow, but there are plenty of strings to pull, trails to follow, and dangers to ensnare themselves in of their own volition. This setting is system-neutral, so the GM (you who are reading this, I assume) can translate the generalities provided here into whatever form works best for the game of their choice.<br/></p>\n<p>This is being released in\u00a0<strong>advent calendar</strong> format, meaning you'll see the first hex on December 1, 2022, and it'll open up a new one every day after that! Is the entire thing written and ready to go? hahahahah, of\u00a0<em>course</em> it is! I would never feverishly try to finish things just before they're due...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T14:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be8f6be8269cea872a093953e97bbb63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Majcher Arcana"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
