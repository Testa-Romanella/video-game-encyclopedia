The theme was \"Out of Control\" so I created this poem about trying to keep control as life goes on. I admit this is more a reading experience than a game but I\u00a0enjoyed making it and the poem is very personal.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I had intended to make a game about keeping the character afloat as obstacles went on, however it become clear that I was not going to manage that within the time so I stripped it back to the core. I am very happy that this still reflects the themes and felling I\u00a0was going for.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The art assets were made within the 48 hours. The music was a pre-made asset. I'm really happy with how everything looks and sounds I think it works really well with the mood of the piece.</p>\n\n<p>I created all the art assets and wrote the poem myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The music was provided by\u00a0Ben Nolan who I have worked with a few times before</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9e7ef4749c0b0da22a880262f684c79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Walrusware"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
