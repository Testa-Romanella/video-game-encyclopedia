It was a lot of work to make new things out of everything I developed. There were a lot of accidents during development, but I am very happy and proud to release this.<br/><br/>I hope you like it.<br/><br/>If you give us a lack of points or feedback while you play, we will actively try to develop it into a better game.<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/><br/>I have been impressed with Cave Story during my junior high school days and have developed the dream of game developers.<br/>Can I make a game like this? <br/>I used to ask myself the question of the rough and delicate Cave Story graphics. That's why you may feel the same atmosphere in my game.<br/>If you compare Sacred Stones with the Cave Story, it's a small game, but I think it's my first step.<br/>In the future, I will make a more unique and fun game with my own color. <br/>Thank you for your support until then. <br/>by Sungjun Jo (NOXBIX)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c966dba218cc1873021de561ec990cd0.jpg", "website": "https://www.noxbix.com/sacredstones", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NoxBiX Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NoxBiX Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
