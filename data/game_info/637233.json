When I was brainstorming how to\u00a0incorporate the limitation, the best thing that I came up with was having to launch chunks of yourself into the world, and I think the mechanic\u00a0works nicely with a top-down shooter type game.\u00a0 As for the style, I decided to go for a minimalistic look and feel to the game since I knew that I wouldn't have enough time to draw all the art I needed (considering how terrible I am at pixel art), and I really wanted to avoid using any online image assets during the competition. I actually did end up spending a couple hours on the graphics though, since I wanted to find a nice color palette to make the game look more polished. Overall, I think the game turned out pretty well, even though it took an hour and a half more than it should've thanks to some unforeseen issues with compression formats.\u00a0As far as my personal feelings about my first game jam,\u00a0I can honestly say\u00a0that I've thoroughly enjoyed the\u00a0experience in the past three days, and I've also learned a ton about Unity!\u00a0If you've actually read down this far, then kudos to you, and enjoy playing \"pop.\".</p>\n\n<p>- Sound effects from ZapSplat</p>\n<p>- Music from Epidemic Sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:01:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbd59462dd3c533e2d215843743af5c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ChromiumCube"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
