The original idea was created by myself and Hunter Keilman, who created the art for Loco Loco on the right. I learned how to create this game in Unity thanks to Youtuber CasanisPlays. This is the start in what I hope to be a long journey in game creation. Still, everyone has to start somewhere, and the experience of bringing this simple game from start to finish has taught me many things.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b8049cd646af2bb157b7e792f44b3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Fulkerson-Bird"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
