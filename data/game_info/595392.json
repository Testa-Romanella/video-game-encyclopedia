I mean, not in the usual cute way, it doesn't walk on two paws or play chess or something. It's just... I sense something uncanny in it, something wicked, as if it knew something.</em></p>\n<p><em>Or maybe I'm just overreacting. Of course, every dog tries to bury it's bone as deep as possible. But I assure you, this dog doesn't keep it's bones in the backyard. Something like the temple of an ancient cult suits it more. I just can't stand this dog.</em></p>\n<p>You play as a dog trying to bury its bone in a very specific spot deep under ground. You can throw it with `k` to stun creatures, run with `wasd` and jump with `spacebar` (hold it to jump higher). Catching the bone while airborne gives you an extra jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Igor - programming.</li><li>Veronika - visuals.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27f7387c1c86dc034eeb5fb3fc153247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["yngvarr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
