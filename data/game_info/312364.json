Tensions will run high as players compete over a constantly depleting and finite resource. A resource that not only burns over time but also whenever a weapon or respawn is utilized. This resource is essentially the players health bar and the only way to refill it is by killing NPCs (Pirates) that patrol the map or to steal it from your enemy's base. At the start of each match, and with every respawn, a wide array of ships will be available to the players. These ships will each demand their own playstyle and bring with them a new dynamic to the match. In order to survive they must make every second, and shot, count.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/02305cdce0e3e8812f7b161489e2466c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlexHartman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
