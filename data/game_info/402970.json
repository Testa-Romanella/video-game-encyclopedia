The game itself is a series of frameworks and editors to allow users to create their own stages, fighters, and modes. TUSSLE is meant to be accessible to non-programmers to quickly make their favorite characters, while still allowing experienced creators to make characters that push the engine to its absolute limit.</p>\n<p>As the game goes further in development, and the player base grows, TUSSLE will become more than just an engine, it will serve as a community hub of creative works, to build a game where anything can happen. Future endeavors include an online module repository, a community-driven character rating and balancing system, and tournament support.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>- Simple tools for building any character you can imagine! Take sprites from video game classics or draw up your own, then get to creating!</p>\n<p>- Customize your game however you see fit, the entire physics engine is at your control! Enable wavedashing, change shield stun, tweak gravity, then save and share your presets with others!</p>\n<p>- Use your own collection of music in-game, with options to adjust song frequency, and even set up playlists instead of loops for stages or game sessions!</p>\n<p>- Fully Compatible with any input device your computer recognizes as an input device!</p>\n<p>- And to top it all off, TUSSLE is, and will always be, FREE!</p>\n<p><strong>Media</strong></p>\n<p>Discord -\u00a0https://projecttussle.com/discord</p>\n<p>Subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectTUSSLE/</p>\n<p>Weekly Blog Posts - http://projecttussle.com/</p>\n<p>Twitter - https://twitter.com/TUSSLEdev</p>\n<p>Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC416SW5rkbsc6zuJc...</p>\n<p>The fastest way to report bugs or contact the dev team is to post on our Discord.
