Create more game levels for a total of 5 playable levels. The environment size will increase as you go with the player fire rate decreasing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Add power ups (shield, temporary speed increase, etc). I would love to add special flying maneuvers if it's not too hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Change existing enemy graphics, I want them to be ships versus aliens/creatures. And/or add stationary astroids throughout the environment.\u00a0</p><p>Created by Alexa Wolkwitz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T16:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f13d7619a21d8c6509f04bde46a48b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["antaresj2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
