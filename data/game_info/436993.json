I wonder how we can think this super- or alter- digital-being of ours as complicit or potentially oppositional to economic regimes of subjectivation, namely surveillance capitalism and neoliberalism, which largely shape not only how we gain our livelihood and reproduce ourselves, but how we construct and navigate our relationships with others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cMetrics and Matrices\u201d refers to themes which will be explored in this environment.
