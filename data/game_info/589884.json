{"id": 589884, "slug": "grimly-gulchs-deathly-aces-read-description", "name": "Grimly Gulch's Deathly Aces (Read Description)", "name_original": "Grimly Gulch's Deathly Aces (Read Description)", "description": "<p>Made for the Bullet Hell Game Jam. Premade assets include the two songs (Our own composition) and a basic character controller. (If WASD does not work for you, reload the page and try again)</p>\n\n<p>A bullet-hell/shooter where you can play as one of four characters, each with unique abilities to help them survive the hordes of bandits who have overrun the town of Grimly Gulch. Can you survive 100 waves or more?<br/></p>\n<p>Play as one of four characters, the sheriff, who can slow time - the bounty hunter, who wields two guns, and can vaporize enemies with the blazing bullets ability (middle click to activate) - the bartender, who can melee enemies with a bottle, deflect bullets, or throw Molotov cocktails - and the card shark, who makes the waves easier by replacing cards with aces.</p>\n<p>The mechanics are simple! WASD to move, mouse to aim.\u00a0Left click is your primary attack, right click depends on the character (time slow, second gun, Molotov), and middle click is for the bounty hunter's special ability. Keep an eye on the timer in the bottom- if it runs out, you lose. But you can gain more time by defeating enemies, so I'm sure you'll be fine!</p>\n<p>Each wave, a 5-card poker hand is dealt to you. The types of cards and the total hand will determine what enemies spawn that round. A 2 spawns two enemies, and a 4 spawns four enemies. 5 and 10 spawn stronger enemies, as well as Jacks, Queens, and Kings. An ace is a free space- so no enemies will spawn from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5da02d384791a6f8f806a0eab7fdf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamPaktGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
