Side-quests that not only change up the pace,\u00a0 but also offer a chance at winning some great items and even permanent buffs!</p>\n<p>In this field trip, you go camping with Baldi.\u00a0Your goal is to keep the fire alive for three minutes. You can play it safe by throwing small amounts of firewood onto the fire, or you can take a riskier strategy by trying to gather a lot of pieces of firewood and throw them in all at once.\u00a0Extra fuel gets converted into big points! Of course, in the full game, higher scores will get you better rewards!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use\u00a0the WASD keys to move, and the mouse to turn.\u00a0Left click to pick up firewood and fuel the fire. Hold down shift to run (Keep an\u00a0eye on your stamina bar!), and press space bar to quickly look behind you.\u00a0Escape can be used to pause, and can be held for about a second to quit at any time.</p>\r\nSocial\u00a0Media and Website\r\n<p>Website: www.basicallygames.com</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0@mystman12</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSpEbeRvUwAJByfKXyIwBA</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game by\u00a0Micah McGonigal</p>\n<p>Keyboard music by\u00a0Cady\u00a0McGonigal</p>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Gimp</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Anim8or</li></ul>\n\r\nNotice\r\n<p>Due to the amount of spam that's been getting posted in the comments section,\u00a0I've disabled them for a bit.\u00a0If you have something you'd like to tell me, feel free to contact me on\u00a0Twitter @mystman12!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119050ac6a648a6235b05f871533aadc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mystman12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
