We developed this for six weeks to get it as stable as we could with the time we had available and the goals we wanted to hit (note: there may be a few bugs around but works for the most part). We felt the project we developed with passion exceeded our expectations in terms of quality and gameplay, that we felt it was worth sharing our work with others.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy our game.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Designers:</p>\n<p>- Daniel D'Onofrio</p>\n<p>- Jacob Bloem</p>\n<p>Programmers:</p>\n<p>- James Brown</p>\n<p>- Costas Allevi</p>\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<p>- Zac Brett</p>\n<p>- John McMahon</p>\n<p>- Craig Maltby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af9c7f1506d5f47137f6dd4a5d8d249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SevenNerdArmy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
