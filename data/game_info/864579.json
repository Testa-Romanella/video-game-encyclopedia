The faster you put in  actions, the faster the thing goes. It\u2019s like Paper Mario except fully  realtime. If you click defend at the exact right time, you take zero  damage. You can play with any input method but realistically, PLAY WITH A  CONTROLLER IF YOU WANT TO WIN.\r\n</p>\n<p>THE GAME IS TOO HARD. I MADE IT  TOO HARD. EVERY SINGLE BATTLE IS ITS OWN CHALLENGE. IT REQUIRES A NEW  STRATEGY. PASS YOUR MP BETWEEN CHARACTERS. DEFEND ONE CHARACTER FROM  DAMAGE. WORK OUT ENEMY ATTACK PATTERNS. USE YOUR NEW ABILITIES. IT\u2019S  BASICALLY A PUZZLE GAME.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is also fucking HUGE and.. I\u2019m  sorry, I really didn\u2019t bother doing the whole \u201cmake this shit easier for  the jam because game jammers are notoriously shit at actually playing  video games so lower the difficulty by 90%\u201d but because of that, I\u2019ve  added a video here where you can see the actual.. full extent of how  cool the battle system is here:\r\n</p>\n<p><em>So  if you really struggle, it\u2019d be nice if you clicked through that video a  couple of places to see what the game has to offer (e.g. 18 monsters, 8  areas etc.)\r\n</em></p><em>\n</em><em>\n<p>Code/Design/story/SFX etc. etc. by Alex Rose Character art by Sophie Cook World art by Simon Wong Music by Atmospherium and D33CO Rude Bear was originally invented by Alex Rose and Antony Dewar</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be551da7b8e0596995ec2289a3b7df72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Rose"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
