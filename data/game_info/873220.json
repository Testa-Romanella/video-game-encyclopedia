Hopefully, with time and resources, I can full flesh-out this project.<br/><br/><em>NOTE: Occasionally the game starts with the player falling through the terrain. Unsure of why this happens, but looking to fix it. For now, just go back to the main menu and retry playing.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2cc875befbe91a0b8ea501cdb5cfde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["coleslaw_abt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
