More features in the future!<br/>CubeLuke is an exciting game, you can play it for about 15-50 minutes and after that you kinda rage quit.<br/><br/><strong>What do you have to do ?<br/></strong>In CubeLuke you have a parcour with blocks/obstacles, you will have to make your way around the obstacles to get to the finish. You are a little cube that have sensitive movement, you move fast and some levels you are faster or slower. There are around 8 levels to complete but more will be added. It is just a simple game but it is my first project ever so don't blame :)<br/><br/><strong>HAVE FUN!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da1/da1ce197b139cb52aea73366e49a4ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mauro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
