{"id": 428092, "slug": "falling-frontier", "name": "Falling Frontier", "name_original": "Falling Frontier", "description": "<p>Falling Frontier is a revolutionary sci-fi RTS where ship design, recon, and logistics are critical elements. Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system.</p>\n<p>A New Star System<br />\nExplore a vast procedurally generated star system filled with planets, moons, asteroid fields, and nebulae. Build and upgrade shipyards, supply depots, refineries, and recon stations as you research new technologies to unlock ship hulls, weapons, orbital facilities, colonization options, and more.</p>\n<p>Combat<br />\nBattles in Falling Frontier combine intuitive control with deep mechanics. Shots can strike unintended targets after missing or ricocheting off hulls and each ship has subsystems that can be damaged or destroyed upon impact. Smaller, more maneuverable craft can defeat much larger vessels through ambush or tactical superiority.</p>\n<p>Logistics<br />\nWars are won or lost through logistics. A weaker opponent can choose to engage in guerrilla warfare, raiding supply depots and refineries, blockading colonies, and otherwise attacking each point in the enemy supply chain. Likewise, a stronger force cannot simply combine their ships into a single massive and unstoppable fleet and must instead strategically distribute smaller defense flotillas throughout their territory.</p>\n<p>Intel<br />\nUse probes, scout ships, and recon stations to explore and monitor the vast emptiness between planets. Recon stations scan defined angles with either passive scans that grant limited information or active scans that give away their position. Similarly, the enemy will continuously search for your forces, and you may hide your ships behind moons or mask their heat signatures near gas giants.</p>\n<p>Design<br />\nFalling Frontier incorporates over 20 different ship types, including frigates, destroyers, cruisers, and battlecruisers, alongside an array of civilian ships. You may create your own designs and choose weapons, utility modules, and other components to best serve your strategic needs.</p>\n<p>Crew<br />\nYour command crews are not abstract and impersonal entities, but rather named individuals with ranks, portraits, and identities. Each officer has their own traits and abilities, making personnel choice a critical factor in efficient flotilla composition. Enemy officers not killed in action can be captured and interrogated, or left in their escape pods as bait in order to ambush any rescue ships.</p>\n<p>Mods<br />\nFalling Frontier supports modding through an in-game scenario editor that allows players to design and share their own star systems, missions, and storyline campaigns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T19:56:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37ce865a26e85122b7f9ebe669aad69c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 2, "toplay": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stutter Fox Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Hooded Horse", "Stutter Fox Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
