{"id": 593815, "slug": "snakes-and-pits", "name": "Snakes and Pits", "name_original": "Snakes and Pits", "description": "<p>Created for WJG 198 - Descent using Unreal Engine by Thomas Helm aka Nocturnal Wisp.</p>\n\n<p>You are a warrior with a destiny, fight your way through snakes or die falling from the crumbling ancient ruins. Your choices are yours, but be warned: there is always death! Also, yeah... you can't die or exit the game without alt + F4 so enjoy lol.<br/></p>\n<p>This game jam was a lot of fun and I really hope to get back to the project to add more mechanics, enemies, items, rogue-like elements and convert all the core functionality to C++ (And make it not code trash).\u00a0Unfortunately, I didn't have much time during this week long game jam\u00a0so it's quite unfinished and has lots of collision issues, blueprint messes, and\u00a0bugs galore. The idea is there, and I hope you like it!!</p>\n\n<p>Controls are:<br/>WASD = Move<br/>R = Restart<br/>. = Pick up Item<br/>, = Use Item<br/></p>\n\n<p>The plan was to have many items and various other mechanics to help elevate the game. I like having goofy looking 3D models and animations as well as a silly texture style. Let me know if you like the idea and the implementation of this small prototype so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80e88721d63c3a54e150373daccb1772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nocturnal Wisp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
