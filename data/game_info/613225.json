He realises he is thinner than the cell bars so he easily walks out of it. However, there are guards present everywhere. So he has to walk around stealthily.\r\n</p>\n<p>After Whirly gets out of the jail, he starts hunting for the man, Psybaba, who framed him and sent him to jail. He reaches a town nearby. Psybaba is very popular over there. He is very much like Ram Rahim, but on a larger scale. His ads are present everywhere in the town. Whirly gets pissed off seeing him everywhere, and he starts ranting over it. This offends the townspeople, who start chasing him. He is barely able to hide from everyone and leave the town.\r\n</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Psybaba is sitting in his ashram where his devotees are fanning him with banana leaves and feeding him grapes. He hears the news of Whirly having abused him, so he gets up and leaves his ashram to find and stop him before it is too late. He travels through a forest looking for Ped-o-phile, the tree who always guides him about what he should do to be a popular baba. Upon meeting him, Ped-o-phile tells Psybaba that he will help him only on one condition - that Psybaba goes inside his mouth and cleans his stomach.\r\n</p>\n<p>While Psybaba is inside Ped-o-phile, Whirly reaches there. He thinks Ped-o-phile to be just a regular tree and sleeps under it. As Psybaba discovers the monster, Digenes, he fights it and defeats it. Digenes is pooped out of Ped-o-phile and he falls on Whirly. Psybaba comes out and sees Whirly. He tells Ped-o-phile to rain fire from the sky and kill both Whirly and Digenes. They manage to escape from there and Digenes takes Whirly to his hideout.\r\n</p>\n<p>Learning about how Ped-o-phile plans to take over all the children in the world with his organic magical fart, which is why Digenes had gone inside him to destroy the secret ingredients. Understanding the terrible consequences that could happen if Ped-o-phile succeeds, Whirly decides to accompany Digenes to stop Ped-o-phile once and for all.\r\n</p>\n<p>Whirly goes back to his town with Digenes alongside him. But as he gets to his town, everyone sees him coming with a monster. They had heard about him ranting against Psybaba also, so they decided that Whirly is definitely some kind of a demon who wants to kill everyone. The whole town picks up arms against Whirly and Digenes, who manage to escape from there and reach Whirly\u2019s house.\r\n</p>\n<p>At Whirly\u2019s house, they decide to come up with a plan to take down Psybaba and Ped-o-phile. Since they had a huge following and were really powerful, they could not be approached directly. And so they decide that they will ambush Ped-o-phile at night when everyone is asleep. They go to the forest at night, but Ped-o-phile had already unleashed his smell. They could not tolerate the smell. Probably there\u2019s a reason why people should not sleep under a tree at night.\r\n</p>\n<p>Battling that smell and finally reaching Ped-o-phile, they have a long fight in which Whirly and Digenes prevail. The news of Ped-o-phile\u2019s defeat reaches Psybaba and he comes out with all his devotees to fight Whirly and Digenes. After a long fight, Digenes defeats all his followers and Psybaba falls to Whirly\u2019s feet. As Psybaba pleads for forgiveness, Digenes suddenly transforms into a tree. In the forest Ped-o-phile turns into a demon.\r\n</p>\n<p>Digenes explains that he was cursed the whole time, where he had exchanged his form with Ped-o-phile, and the organic farts would have given Ped-o-phile his following that would have prevented any child from realising his evil ways. Everyone hails Whirly as their new Baba. However, because of being a demon for so long, Digenes had started picking up evil ways. He wanted people to follow him more, so he started creating organic gases to turn children into his followers. Meanwhile Whirly also realises being a Baba lets him live a comfortable life, which is possible only as long as Psybaba is not around him.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the end Psybaba is thrown in jail, where he thinks he can get out and escape to take his revenge from Whirly.\r\n</p>\r\nCharacter Sketch\r\n\r\nWhirly\r\n<p>Whirly has two different forms. One is where he is a fugitive (as the protagonist), and one where he is a baba (as the antagonist). Some of his traits remain common in both the cases as well.\r\n</p>\r\nAs a Fugitive\r\n<ul><li>Courageous but overconfident, often lands in trouble because of his loud mouth behaviour.\r\n</li><li><strong>Naive</strong> - His behaviour makes it seem as though he does not understand whatever is happening around him. He foul mouths Psybaba in the town where everything is dedicated to him, he takes Digenes to his town, he sleeps under Ped-o-phile.\r\n</li><li><strong>Helpful</strong> - He chose to help Digenes long before he knew that Digenes was of any help to him. The act which Digenes told that he had to perform was very risky and dangerous from both physical and social aspects, yet he chose to do it in order to save the children from Ped-o-phile.\r\n</li><li><strong>Stealthy</strong> - He is an expert in hiding and blending in with the surrounding when the guards or townspeople are looking for him.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nAs a Baba\r\n<ul><li><strong>Greedy and power hungry </strong>- He wants everyone to worship him and doesn\u2019t want Psybaba to come in his way, and so sends him to prison. He even brainwashes people to lynch anyone who accuses him of fraud.\r\n</li><li><strong>Grateful</strong> - After having become the baba, Whirly did not give up on Digenes. He continued being his friend because of how Digenes helped him. In return he lets Digenes take control over all the children in the world.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nIn Both the Cases\r\n<ul><li><strong>Self aware </strong>- Breaks fourth wall continuously. He knows it very well that he is a Warli stick figure and he can easily get through narrow spaces and even disassemble himself to blend in with the surroundings.\r\n</li><li><strong>Stuck in a loop between the story </strong>- Turns into the antagonist after winning and into the protagonist after losing.\r\n</li><li><strong>Mysterious </strong>- The entire story takes place in the form of a loop. After Whirly is defeated by Psybaba, he goes back to the way he was in the beginning of the game. It feels as though there is nothing in his entire life other than just the events of the game.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nPsybaba\r\n<p>Psybaba has two different forms. One is where he is a fugitive (as the protagonist), and one where he is a baba (as the antagonist).

Ped-o-phile always had the best interest for Psybaba in mind, as he believed Psybaba would help him in return for all the goodwill that he showed.\r\n</li><li><strong>Grateful - </strong>Since Psybaba helped Ped-o-phile become the legendary tree that he is, he chooses to be Psybaba's loyal partner. With his superpowers, he could have been a more influential figure than Psybaba, but he chose to let Psybaba have his share of fame. He did whatever Psybaba asked him to, and that included raining fire from the sky even though he knew his idea was better than Psybaba.\r\n</li><li><strong>Cunning - </strong>He helps Psybaba because he believes Psybaba will give him whatever he wants in return for his good work. He wants to use the resources to create an organic gas, but he lies to Psybaba by telling him that the gas is needed for his survival.\r\n</li><li><strong>Ambitious - </strong>He wants to create an organic gas as it will make all the children around the world become his followers. Since children are easy to persuade, Ped-o-phile believes that if they follow him till they grow up, they shall continue to have an emotional attachment for him during their adulthood, thereby accepting him as a God even if Digenes slays and transforms him into a demon.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nAs a Monster\r\n<ul><li><strong>Determined - </strong>In spite of knowing the risk of taking on Digenes face to face, Ped-o-phile doesn't hesitate from going inside him and destroying his gas. Even as Whirly defeated him, he managed to run out of Digenes at the right time.\r\n</li><li><strong>Rational - </strong>He knows exactly all the problems that Digenes will create, and thus will not allow him to unleash his evil plan. When he and Psybaba were running from the rain of fire, he was quick to understand where his hideout would be, unlike anyone else who would have lost his cool at that moment.\r\n</li><li>Does not know about the player.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nDigenes\r\nAs a Monster\r\n<ul><li><strong>Determined - </strong>In spite of knowing the risk of taking on Ped-o-phile face to face, Digenes doesn't hesitate from going inside him and destroying his gas.

He doesn\u2019t normally tell what the other person is planning. However, he does try to tell Whirly about Ped-o-phile being more than just a regular tree, but Whirly does not pay attention to him.\r\n</li><li><strong>Confused - </strong>The player came to the scenario in the beginning of the game, which is the point where Whirly was being thrown in a prison cell. This is why the player didn\u2019t know what was going on. He even asks Whirly what happened, but when Whirly began telling the story the loading screen popped up, because of which he couldn\u2019t hear anything. Even when Psybaba accused him of getting Whirly out of prison, he was confused as he didn\u2019t know what to do.\r\n</li><li><strong>Blackmailing - </strong>The player often blackmails Whirly and Psybaba whenever they accuse him/her of controlling them. Since the player knows this is just a game and the story will progress by the player\u2019s will, he/she knows that his/her role in the game is more important than anyone else.</li><li><strong>Smart - </strong>The player comes up with a solution for helping the protagonists take down the tree, but Whirly/Psybaba stole the idea. At that moment the mob entered their house, but since the player was angry at that time he/she drew a sword for Whirly/Psybaba and let them kill them all against their will.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T11:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa8bb1641b6bebc190388149012c992c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Puroo Roy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
