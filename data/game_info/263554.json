It\u2019s a whimsical approach to some classic themes, and a simplified approach to others. The controls can be learned very quickly, and its non-violent tone makes it something players of all ages can enjoy. <br/><br/>Players compete for the highest score in a 3D arena flying customizable spacecraft with a unique pulsed propulsion. Snag tokens for points, and popup items for their effects while you attempt to cross out other players with your trail for more points. Avoid collisions as each \"cross out\" incurs a score penalty. Only the highest score can win.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul>[* 3D Multiplayer Space Arena Action][* 7 Customizable Spacecraft][* Free-for-all and Elimination Play Modes][* 2 Playable Levels][* Flight Maneuvers][* Much More to Come]</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/6621affa8d84a9a03944c5e40fd9112b.jpg", "website": "http://www.starcrossarena.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Hogwash"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Hogwash"], "esrb_rating": null}
