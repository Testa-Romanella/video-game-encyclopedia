Hence this game is especially big for an GameJam-game.<br/>Next, an Day and Night cycle. Some things for this are trivial in Unreal, some not so much.<br/>Next, changing graphic settings. Even my smaller games caused graphic cards to scream in pain, so I wanted at least the posibility to limit the frame rate. I did include multiple settings, which I now can gradually add in future projects.<br/>Then, on of the main points for me to learn: Foliage. How to make trees. I have gathered basic understanding for that with this game, but it takes much fine-tuning to get right.</p><p>And of course:<br/>All assets (with exception for the Grass and Mud textures for painting the ground) were created in GameJam-time.<br/>So all in all: Too many tasks at once for myself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/640/6404ed18d33e0a36a286dc86babc5bbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["rokuyomi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
