Once a day, a player must be sacrificed so the others can live. What lengths will you go to to be the last remaining?<br/><br/>The group must decide who is the next to be eliminated. How could you make that impossible choice? You only see one option. At night you <strong>vote</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Work together during the day, turn against each other at night. Will you be defeated by the starvation, the trials of the island, or the complicated island politics? <br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Deep, strategic, turn-based gameplay. Simple &amp; easy-to-learn mechanics that cause nuanced, social consequences.<br/></li><li>Online multiplayer. Betray real-world friends or strangers on the internet.<br/><br/></li><li>A game with voting at it's core. Do you lie &amp; scheme, or fly under-the-radar? How you play is up to you.<br/><br/></li><li>Balance your individual goals with the survival of the group. Eating more will give you a survival advantage, but it will not make your popular.<br/><br/></li><li>Randomly generated events and tools, along with the unique turn-order system, make every playthrough different. The decisions you make early will determine how the week plays out. <br/><br/></li><li>The AI of the island will decide your circumstances. Those met with good luck may find themselves targeted by others, while the unfortunate may be ignored as unthreatening. Adapt your strategy to the hand you've been dealt.<br/><br/></li><li>Those eliminated will still have a role to play on the final day if you choose to stick around. Short sessions mean it won't be long until you're back in the action!</li></ul><br/>To learn more about Dead In The Tropics, please visit: <br/>http://deadinthetropics.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T06:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f714bbe2de5fad2b6327de31269b29.jpg", "website": "http://deadinthetropics.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Red Mister"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Red Mister"], "esrb_rating": null}
