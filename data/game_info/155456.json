Although only a single episode is explored, the\u00a0 player\u2019s choices (when they occur) drastically alter where the story ends and the broader implications of a single person\u2019s choices on the rest of the world. Through\u00a0 engaging dialogue, a subtle yet heavy - handed commentary, and biting absurdist humor,\u00a0 \u201cCliq\u201d makes the player feel as if they can make a difference with just a single click .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/92467db9743e970aa3ffa70180eddcf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cjshaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
