Minutes couldn\u2019t go fast enough for us as kids. But if we look back to that time it was just an instant.</em>\n<p>Paused is a 3D action-adventure about the natural desire to stay connected to our inner child.\u00a0It is the tale of an otter named Thea.<br/>The core mechanic in Paused is the ability to slow down time to the point of total stop.<br/>It is called \u201cShimmer\u201c and is a metaphor of that sensation of time your had as a child. \u201cShimmer\u201c slows down objects gradually. Nearby objects are stopped in motion while the farther away an object gets the more normal it's motion applies.</p>\n<p>In the current pre-alpha version you can explore puzzles and mechanism of this ancient otter civilization and their interaction with the \"Shimmer\"-mechanic.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to advance to a higher level of the canyon you are starting in.</p>\r\nCurrent control mappings\r\n<p><strong>Gamepad is highly recommended!</strong></p>\n\r\nGamepad / Gamecontroller<br/>\r\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse<br/>\r\nDeveloper\r\n<p>Developed by ThoughtBread a small indie-dev team from Trier, Germany.</p>\r\nby ThoughtBread<br/>\n<p>Music created by Vanessa Barth</p>\n\n<p><em>Paused (Pre-Alpha) uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.
