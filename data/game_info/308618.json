And to expand a bit of portfolio stuff for myself when it comes to code.</p>\n<p>This little demo only features the \"first stage\" (Up til the first boss of the game). But I plan on updating it in the future to be a full release gradually. But for now this is just it.</p>\n<p>This features:</p>\n<p>- A controllable jump.</p>\n<p>- Upgrades / Whip Power ups that will allow you to have an easier time with the game, IE: Negating knockback, Whipping in all directions.</p>\n<p>- Classic Sub weapons you all remember, with minor tweaks. (For instance, I made the Cross Boomerang be able to be shot upwards and infront of Simon.)<br/></p>\n<p>Credits for everything are in the notepad file provided. But just incase for legal reasons:</p>\n<p>Castlevania and all Rights are to KONAMI. I do NOT own any of it. This was out of fun and shits and giggles.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd0fde26cb90c9d3a3175e609637371b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazylunaticXD"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
