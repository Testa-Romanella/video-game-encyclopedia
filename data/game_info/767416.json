The only question is - how long will you survive?</p>\n<p>CinderWoods is about surviving the oncoming forest fire as long as possible. Just running away is not a good option. Harvest resources of wood and stone and use them to construct fire barriers to give yourself a momentary reprieve, by slowing the spread.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Barriers require 2 wood resources and 1 stone resource to build. Manage your resources by keeping a close eye on the counters\u2026 don\u2019t get caught without a barrier to get behind.\r\n</p>\n<p>Get a higher score by delaying the inevitable. The longer you make it and the less fire there is, the faster your score climbs.\r\n</p>\n<p>Stop. Drop. And run!</p>\n<p>Development Team:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>@_defau1t_\u00a0</li><li>kirypto</li><li>Omers</li><li>@Wanooknox\u00a0</li><li>WasteOfAmmo</li></ul>\n<p>Attribution:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Music and sound effects from GameDev Market [https://www.gamedevmarket.net/]\u00a0</li><li>Additional sound effects from Zapsplat [https://www.zapsplat.com/]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/1195257e8da542dc4090fffc55eaaaad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kryogenic Amusement"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
