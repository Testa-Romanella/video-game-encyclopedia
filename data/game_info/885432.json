Unfortunately, you don't have any conventional ammo, so you'll have to resort to using the corn you grow to defeat each wave of slimes!</p>\n<p>How many nights can you survive?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use the WASD keys to move around.</li><li>Press Space over an empty patch of soil to plant 25 corn kernels on the soil. Over time, they'll grow into 50 kernels!</li><li>Press Space over a patch of soil with corn on it to harvest the corn.</li><li>Use the mouse to aim, and hold down the left mouse button to fire. Be careful, though - <strong>firing uses up corn that you've harvested!</strong></li><li>Press E to sell 50 corn kernels for 5 cash. This ability is best used in case of emergency, but you can use it at any time!<br/>\n</li><li>Press M to toggle the background music.</li><li>Press N to toggle the ambient sounds of nature.</li></ul>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>If you have only 25 kernels left, you can't fire, so make sure to harvest more corn!</li><li>Shoot slimes with enough corn to pop them. Popping slimes is worth cash!</li><li>You have three lives, which replenish at the end of a night. Taking a hit from a slime causes you to lose a life.</li><li>Survive and earn enough cash at the end of the night to progress through a wave. Your high score is the number of waves you survived before losing all your lives or running \"Outta Cash\"!</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game programmed by ThePowerPlayer</li><li>All artwork created by ThePowerPlayer</li><li>Music by 0blivion#8958 on Discord</li><li>Sounds generated using ChipTone and freesound.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T09:37:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50ed6717a1d911d9e7b6935548f96ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ThePowerPlayer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
