You are a tourist from a future Earth, traveling to a parallel dimension where magic and myth are an everyday occurrence and nuisance. You came looking for adventure - whether as hero or villain doesn't matter. What the Institute of Dimensional Travel didn't tell you, though, is that you're never gonna be able to come home.</p>\n<p>You will die. You will continue. You will terrorise. And you will slaughter. This world is now your playground, and you will make of it whatever you wish.</p>\n\n<p>--controls--</p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MKB: WASD\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: Left stick</p>\n<p>Right hand primary attack:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MKB: Left mouse\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: RT</p>\n<p>Right hand secondary attack:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MKB: E\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: RB</p>\n<p>Left hand primary attack:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MKB: Right mouse\u00a0 Gamepad: LT</p>\n<p>Left hand secondary attack:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MKB: Q\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gamepad: LB</p><p>Pickup weapon right hand:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MKB: E\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: RB</p><p>Pickup weapon left hand:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MKB: Q\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gamepad: LB</p>\n<p>Jump:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MKB: Space\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: A</p>\n<p>Camera zoom in/out:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MKB: Numpad +/-\u00a0 \u00a0Gamepad: D-pad up/down</p>\n<p>Sprint toggle:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MKB: Left shift\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gamepad: Click left stick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0e/f0e8313dc7172c24433977383a9a20e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["irmoz"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
