In order to find the four Doodads needed to confront this evil, the Heroes must find the secret lairs hidden behind the world\u2019s waterfalls.</p>\n<p>However, what if there were no more waterfalls left in the world, save for one?</p>\n<p>Join Cascadia, the last remaining waterfall, in a journey to fulfill the requirements of legend and hide the Doodads from the Legendary Heroes, in this really short and pretty silly RPG!</p>\n\n<p>The genesis of this game is a sole tweet by one Peter Molydeux.\u00a0This being one of my favorite tweets of his, I kept the idea stored away in my brain. I wasn\u2019t able to make anything based on it for either of the two\u00a0MolyJams, but a solid idea started forming in my head in the second half of 2014, and I got to work that same November.</p>\n<p>I also incorporated elements and text from\u00a0The Grand List of Console Role-Playing Game Clich\u00e9s, which, as evidence of longevity, sports a screenshot bearing a watermark from\u00a0the original GIA. Yes, it\u2019s that old. It\u2019s also awesome, and I even had some of my small contributions included back in the day (I\u2019m \u201cReeve, Shinra Inc.\u201d in the credits).</p>\n<p>Anyway, armed with these two sources of inspiration, a copy of RPG Maker VX Ace, some of my favorite graphics software, and a JRPG-soaked brain, over the course of the next month and a half, I slapped together this little game. Instead of doing one of my annual (usually)\u00a0fanart \u201cHoliday Cards\u201d, I\u00a0made\u00a0this game my seasonal gift to my online friends. If you are one of those people here right now, Happy Holidays!</p>\n\n<ul><li>A tiny world to explore!</li><li>Atypical boss battles!</li><li>Collectible RPG Cliches!</li><li>RPG references both obvious and obscure!</li><li>Multiple endings!</li></ul>\n\n<p>These are the base requirements for RPG Maker VX Ace itself, which should be fine for the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Operating system:</strong>\u00a0Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (32 or 64 bit)\u00a0<br/><strong>CPU:</strong>\u00a0Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or equivalent\u00a0<br/><strong>Memory:</strong>\u00a0512 MB<br/>\n</p>\n<p>RPG Maker VX Ace itself is\u00a0<em>not required</em>\u00a0to play this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, although this game was made on a Mac, sorry, but there is no Mac OS X version.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Keyboard Controls and Controller Support:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>On a standard keyboard:</em><br/>\r\n\u2013 Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.<br/>\r\n\u2013 Enter (numpad): confirm choices and get on/off the airship (when available).<br/>\r\n\u2013 Zero (0) (numpad): cancel choices and open the menu.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><em>With an Xbox controller (wired 360 tested):</em><br/>\r\n\u2013 Use the left analog stick to up, down, left, and right.<br/>\r\n\u2013X: confirm choices and get on/off the airship (when available).<br/>\r\n\u2013B: cancel choices and open the menu.</p>\n<p>I also tested the game with a PlayStation controller (DualShock 2 with USB adapter), but could not get it to work. If you have better luck with any DualShock, or any other type of controller for that matter, please let me know and I\u2019ll add the info here.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The original content in\u00a0<em>Legend of Cascadia</em>\u00a0is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50b918c55283b3c3f01d6fbef4cf8187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brainscraps"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
