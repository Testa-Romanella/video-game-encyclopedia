In Rush Royale towers are replaced by mighty warriors and wizards!<br/> <br/>Base defense games got serious... but are still are a lot of fun! Your heroes are the castle defense, last and best hope against a rush of enemies. Watch them rain arrows and magic missiles in a valiant struggle at horde defense!<br/> <br/>It's a unique combination of a turret defense and a collectibe card game! Just like random dice rolls decide the fate of battling armies, here you must depend on Lady Luck to win and prevail! Assemble a deck of most powerful tower defense heroes!<br/> <br/>It's TD... but with a competitive twist! Rush against your best friends (or worst foes) - the first one to complete the castle defense wins! In a way, it is a real time PvP defense - what few TD games have!<br/> <br/>Protect your kingdom!  Clash with mighty enemies and fearsome bosses, unleash magic and steel upon your foes in battle! It's one of the most fast paced tower defense games... and it looks as cute as a merge game, too!<br/> <br/>Use your turret defense resources wisely - like in good base defense games, the smartest general wins!<br/> <br/>Collect, defend and dominate!
