This is going to be the part of the game where you fight the different bosses within the game. I have uploaded this separately to my dungeon game to get feedback on what people think.</p><p>This is in its very early stage there are going to be things that are out of place. Please let me know what you think I could do to improve and I will make changes to help make my product better.\u00a0</p><p>This is just a test run of my game. You can not fight or die in this game so once finished just leave as you normally would. You use the arrow keys to move about. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to any feedback that you might have.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc5a7d799b5134a5ec76743d4a0068b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LukeScott1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
