You pick it up and roll the dice. You're\u00a0sent to a randomly selected level. You want to make it back home. You roll the dice over and over again. You never know where you'll go next. Might be another level. Or, it might be your house. Who knows, you might never even make it home.</p>\n<p>Submitted for the GMTK Game Jam 2022</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong></p>\n<p>A/D or Arrow Keys\u00a0= Move</p>\n<p>Space/W = Jump</p>\n<p>E/Right Shift = Attack</p>\n<p>R/Right Ctrl = Interact</p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Art and game\u00a0made by me (TheLuchenator)</p>\n<p>Font: Press Start 2P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:56:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f197b96b794f32e7b2fb7630824bdad6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheLuchenator"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
