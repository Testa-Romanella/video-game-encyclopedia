But there is a twist, you're disorganized. This means whenever you have multiple items in your inventory things get jumbled. In turn every round you get a random item from your inventory. Plan out your kills and destroy all the enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:38:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab5aaaad766f8a5dbcdf4ac2963e981e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["agurcan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
