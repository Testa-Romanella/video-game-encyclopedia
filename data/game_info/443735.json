It is not a game but I do really love the way it turned out and thought it deserved to be published! It was a very exciting project as it plays right into my love of Astronomy so I made sure it turned out perfectly.</p>\n<p>So far I have the Sun, Venus, Earth and its moon and Mars and its 2 moons. I may add other planets later on.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2e30c7f100383342b617a734afb363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ccara001"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
