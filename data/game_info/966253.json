None of these short games have nearly enough content to be a full game, but they were all fun for me to create and play, so I wanted to let others play them, as well.  In these four mini-games you can take the role of an Immortal Dragon God trapped in a prison and plotting revenge, a young apprentice to a powerful wizard who undergoes a dangerous test, a young boy who has to overcome a challenging journey, and a... rock.   Yes... a rock.  You'll see.  All four games have simple controls and their own unique stories.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI hope to continue making fun games in the future using everything I've been learning so far, and would genuinely appreciate honest feedback.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T03:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c7957dfc3f943bdcf439b46f04dd3aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragon Ducky Gaming"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Dragon Ducky Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
