BOTOLO is a fast paced mindreading competition, a dance inside the negative space between your opponent's thoughts. Mind-wrestle your opponents into submission inside hypnotic fields of pattern and color. Steal the ball and protect it from your opponent in this hybrid game of keepaway and king-of-the-hill. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNo friends? No problem. BOTOLO has built-in, state-of-the-art friend simulations! Granted, these incredible programs might not appreciate the simple beauty of a sunset, or lend you a reassuring hug in a time of need, but they DO adapt to your playstyle mid-match, which is almost as good.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c109230566f3f2d3f9883d2a0b9cba99.jpg", "website": "http://botologame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ian Snyder"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ian Snyder"], "esrb_rating": null}
