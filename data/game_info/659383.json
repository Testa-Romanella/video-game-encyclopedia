I joined that amazing server when it was GWJ24 - 2 year anniversary of the jam itself. This is my 12th GWJ (because I missed one, the \"nomad\" theme). It's a holy number, must mean something.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to push myself much harder than usual. I started the jam having a clear goal: I will not focus on plot. Will make a juicy game instead. <em>But </em>I ended up writing a story as well because I simply can't help myself. <em>Aaaand </em>I voiced it. Myself. Yes, all, voices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And I decided to be bolder and not only include the theme and 3 wildcards, but I actually included a bit more. Check in the game!</p>\n<p>This game is my largest game project I ever released. I might turn this into a complete game. In that case, consider the jam version as a \"public demo\" and the game over screen as a \"to be continued\".</p>\n<p><strong>Everything in this game was made by me. All assets are 100% original. Zero \"freebies\" or \"creative commons\" etc. All done in blender, GIMP, LMMS, audacity and my throat.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b1325f59cffdb36426f3f2103354d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mad Parrot Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
