I heard about the tragic suicide of Aaron Swartz last spring and made this game in ten hours.

I\u2019ve dealt with depression my whole life, but that was the last time I succumbed to suicidal ideation. It\u2019s been nineteen years. This game discusses a lot of things pretty frankly\u2014 completed suicide attempts of friends, being rushed to the ER, using Christianity to prop up my self-discipline for a while, my fears for my children.</p>\n<p>You can argue whether or not this is a GAME, I guess, but it\u2019s definitely me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/061e10134367adb3145abd5389755a0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Elizabeth Sampat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
