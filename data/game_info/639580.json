Some physics objects, levers that interact with doors, but also, portals! Portals will make some objects disappear so use them to get to places you haven't been to before. Note: This game has a lot of bugs and times you get in levels <strong>cannot be saved.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T08:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447a3452f28bfcbe0f62aad41189fb13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tnaz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
