Navigate through each dungeon by being the right size to fit through doors that lead to the next room.\u00a0Control your slime, absorb enemies to grow in size, and be damaged by them to shrink, and become the right size to fit through one of the doors to progress through the dungeon. Some rooms have puzzles to progress, use your wits to continue. Your goal is to reach the end of each dungeon and defeat the boss. As you play you may feel a sense of confusion and then accomplishment once you figure out the puzzle or get to the right size. The dungeons might feel tiring at first, but every room is one step closer to the goal.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art, Animation,\u00a0SFX, and Music -\u00a0 Christopher Mathie</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Puzzle, Room and Boss Programming -\u00a0Nathan Prieto</p>\n<p>Enemy Programming and Boss Programming - Dylan Higashionna</p>\n<p>Mechanic Design -\u00a0Christopher Mathie, Nathan Prieto, and Dylan Higashionna</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/623/62344edd97bb7e44d9b92efa3d58ff52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cmathie580"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
