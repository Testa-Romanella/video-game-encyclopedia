It's a small god/puzzle game where you must create a planet which can sustain life by blocking unwanted asteroids and letting others crash into your planet adding their element which they carry.</p>\r\nHow-To-Play\r\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><strong>:</strong> Grab your mouse because that's all you're going to need! Left click on an asteroid, hold that button down drag in the direction you want to fling it and let go and watch that baby fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Crash asteroids into your planet and watch as the element which is signified in its element symbol makes a change to your planet. Experiment to find out what element does what.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong> Get your planet to that goldilocks zone so it can start to grow life. Watch as life slowly rises in your world and when it reaches 100% you get a cookie! \u2013 Well not really but you do win!</p>\r\nSoftware and Development\r\n<p>This game was mostly created in one sleepless coffee induced coder-thon where I tried to make up for my lack of time on day one. I used Unity to create the game, as this is the engine I am most familiar with and will be working with in the future - so good practice to. Blender for the small amount of 3D modelling I had to do for this project which I wanted to keep to a minimum. Photoshop was used to create all the textures for the 3D models and the particles and finally sound was created on http://www.bfxr.net.</p>\r\nOpt-Out\r\n<p>I did not make the music, the track used was sourced from: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) - Ambiment - Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0.</p>\r\nFeature List - Completed\r\n<ul><li>Asteroids with Elements represented by their respective periodic element symbol.</li><li>Planet smoothly changes in form and colouration with asteroid impacts.</li><li>Simple main menu and credits.</li><li>Basic Sound and music.</li></ul>\r\nFeature List - MIA\r\n<ul><li>Tutorial level.</li><li>Better more user-friendly UI.</li><li>Better asteroid spawning.</li><li>Two more levels with different difficulties.</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my game, any feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70ec36fc7b24e81dd4d375341f70088c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TurnWolf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
