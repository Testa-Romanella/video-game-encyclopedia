We use this game as a reference and develop it by adding the tower defense genre which makes it more difficult and challenging. This game uses an art style in the form of pixel art. This game tells the story of a farmer who tries to protect his warehouse from pests that attack his farm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of this game is to get rid of pests that want to attack the farmer's barns. Players must protect the base and farm area from being attacked by pests. Pests can attack players within a certain radius. The player will lose if the barn is destroyed. Players can kill pests using their\u00a0weapon. In addition, players can also plant special plants that can help kill pests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay Progression</strong></p>\n<p>The difficulty of this game increases according to the waves. The higher the wave, the more enemies will attack and the stronger the enemy will be. By killing enemies, players will gain experience that can be used to increase player or plant strength. Upgrade will be given randomly, thus providing a new experience every time the player enters a new game. The end of the game is when the player manages to survive until the final wave, defeats the last enemy, and defeats all enemies on the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<ol><li>Arceilo Hananta (programmer)</li><li>Samuel Fernando (programmer)</li><li>Ilham Bachtiar Irfani (artist)</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T06:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca0843320dcca68178d4155c690c5166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raion Community"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
