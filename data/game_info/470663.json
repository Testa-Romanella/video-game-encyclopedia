Who is the best dasher? You play as a small pink creature named \u201cTHE PINK DASHER\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To collect points you need to destroy the bombs by dashing into them and to gather rings. You can also jump and move left or right to avoid the bombs (however avoiding them gets you no points).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rings help you also to stay alive. If you have gathered rings and you get hit by a bomb you don\u2019t die immediately, but you have chances to lose 50% of the rings you gathered. If you get hit and you have no rings, you die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 3 types of bombs. Green ones give you the least amount of points, blue ones more points and the purple ones the most points. Bombs also come towards you at increasing speed.\u00a0<br/>In order to start the game you must register with a username and password. Data is used only for leaderboard purposes.\u00a0<br/>Hope you enjoy it! And may the best dasher stay on top at the leaderboard!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Andreea - Game Tester / Pixel Artist</p>\n<p>Free Game Asset -\u00a0\u00a0https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-tiny-hero-sprites-pixel-art</p>\n<p>JDWasabi -\u00a0https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack</p>\n<p>GameSupplyGuy -\u00a0https://gamesupply.itch.io/200-space-sound-effects<br/></p>\n<p>tim.kahn -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/tim.kahn/sounds/60655/</p>\n<p>YouFulca -\u00a0https://youfulca.itch.io/legendary-jrpg-battle-music-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:01:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315a44030291ffc43bb5abdfa77cf8ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B3b3L"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
