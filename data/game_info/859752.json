Why slimes? Because that was the first pixelart I created in my life and had no time for other enemies. I never tried pixelart style, but it was good. I learnt a lot even tough it fas only 48hours. :smile:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>- Move = WASD</p>\n<p>- Change sword position = Left mouse move\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Attack = Left mouse click</p>\n<p>- Menu: Escpae</p>\n<p>- Interact with locations: E</p>\n<p>- Dash: Space</p>\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\n<p>The game's goal is to get more points, however you only get the points if you escape through the Portal. If you just die, then 0 points. There are 6 lcoations you can visit in the game, but every 10 seconds they replace each others position, so you have to plan how you will go to the portal, because that is one of them too. If you are unlucky, you always lose the chance to reach it. (Or just wait there, but the slimes are still spawning)</p>\n<p><strong>Locations</strong></p>\n<p>- Shrine (you can choose from powerups every 30 seconds[every 3 environment change])</p>\n<p>- Sanctuary (A magic barrier that explodes dealing AOE damage around it)</p>\n<p>- Well of Life (Gives you two HP)</p>\n<p>- Winery (You can get wine from the barrel near it)</p>\n<p>- Drunk Warrior (You can give the wine to him and he will do a strong AOE damage)</p>\n<p>- Portal (Game exit)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerups</strong></p>\n<p>There are several upgrades for stats</p>\n<p>- Health</p>\n<p>- Damage</p>\n<p>- And you can even get +points</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slime types</strong></p>\n<p>- Simple green slime (Your average neighborhood slime)</p>\n<p>- Blue slime (he is THE fast, but deals less damage)</p>\n<p>- Brown slime (if blue is the fast, it is the big - what you can expect as always: slow movement &amp; attack, but big damage)</p>\n<p>- Red slime (this is literally a bug in my game, i planned to shoot fireballs from it, but now it just damages you from far like a cheater)</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<strong>What you can expect in this game</strong></p>\n<p>- Bax pixelart and funny (at least how bad they are) animations</p>\n<p>- Somehow not bad particle effects</p>\n<p>- Some bugs</p>\n\n<p><strong>Softwares used</strong></p>\n<p>- Game Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>- Art: Aseprite</p>\n<p>- Sound: sfxr and bfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T07:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/99883a048d82d6d435b6c67e273c0499.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DanielPal"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
