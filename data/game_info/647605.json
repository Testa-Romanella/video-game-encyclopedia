Will you be able to survive this retro battle against evil that mixes top-down action-rpg with arcade?<br/><br/>You must protect the Book of the Dead from the hordes of Evil that come from the forest to invade the cabin. If they take this Grimoire of Darkness to their Master, then it will be Game Over for you, your girlfriend and the whole world.  Hang in there until dawn!<br/><br/>But do not worry, like a horror movie from the 80s, in this retro arcade game you'll have the help of melee weapons, stylish guns, insane magic items, an uncontrolled chainsaw and much more!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T02:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f06164252ee25ed61ee2c55069c309a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K.O."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cabin Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
