She's spent years trying to escape her hometown and the fear it inspires in her, only to be called back for the funeral of an old friend. As she looks into the mysterious death, she finds all is not as it seems - not her friend's death, not the folk tale, not even her long-time boyfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a narrative-heavy,\u00a0text-based dramatic horror game developed in Twine. It does have dialogue branches and two different endings, but the majority of the story is fairly linear. Often, it reads like a short story. It's about 12,000 words in total.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs in this game, please let me know!
