In one of these colonies our protagonist,\u00a0<strong>Bram</strong>, found himself alongside his last living relative\u00a0<strong>Barbara</strong>, but when the oppression of the tyrant\u00a0<strong>Varga</strong>\u00a0becomes too much, beginning to shake the community's structures for his benefit, an organized escape takes hold, led by none other than his wife,\u00a0<strong>Lauren</strong>, who was horrified by his crimes that put at risk not only her children's lives but also the entire colony. However, the novel's story doesn't begin during the great escape that led hundreds of people to flee into an almost uninhabitable desert in an unrecognizable world, but rather years later, after\u00a0<strong>Lauren's</strong>\u00a0son,\u00a0<strong>Adrian</strong>, sees the opportunity to escape from his tyrant father and taking\u00a0<strong>Bram</strong>, along with him, they run on a poorly planned escape filled with empty promises of a better life together that ends up repeating the tragedy of their first failed escape years ago, but this time with even worse consequences.\u00a0<br/>Now,\u00a0<strong>Bram</strong>\u00a0finds himself lost and alone in the middle of the desert, with no reason to continue or to turn back, his empty hopes, malnutrition, and dehydration taking over quickly and leaving the fennec between life and death. What kind of dangers lies ahead in this new world?
