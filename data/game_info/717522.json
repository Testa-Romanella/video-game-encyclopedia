In this Game, there is a big cookie and a Shop Icon next to it. When you click the Cookie you will get a Cookie$ (short: C$). These can be spent at the shop Icon. If you click the shop Icon and have the required C$ (isplayed above the shop icon), a clicker will fly out of the shop and to the Cookie. Asides from that, the amount of C$ displayed above the shop Icon at the time you clicked it will be subtracted from your current C$ count. This game doesn\u00b4t have any Goal other than to have fun and probably play it whilst doing something else. (there are no Saves ((((yet)))))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8f6e2a1f7b72f6560bba1a65347ed8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miel_8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
