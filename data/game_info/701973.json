It's an authentic autobiographic, self-deprecating but genuinely sincere game about having OCD. Finish completing the rituals in time in basic adventure game puzzles in this gripping real life simulator. After all, aren't we all \"a little OCD\"\u2122</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Sadness: The Game</strong></p>\n<p>You have to rescue the head of Noah from the inner back chamber of a giant hunchback. A pretty anxious game created over a few hours. Probably only notable for the sound design. Play with headphones in a darkened room, if you please. Much love.<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>The Wall (a game in therapy)</strong></p>\n<p>Breakout as a metaphor for therapy.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Play through over *5* different therapy sessions with unique clients  and their medically fascinating problems. Uncover their traumas from  breaking down the \"wall\" of repression, but make sure to listen to what  they have to say, unless you dig a little too deep...\r\n  </p>\n<p>Based on a parodic therapy site I made in high school which was  hacked and taken over by a minor religious fundamentalist and the times I  feel fed up with therapy. The satirical aim is diffuse and muddled.\r\n</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Gout Pony's 'A Family Gouting': The Game</strong></p>\n<p>Gout's about! There's no need to grout! Don't pout! Get some gout!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Gout Pony's 'A Family Gouting: The Game'\u2122 is the ultimate experience  in gout! Play avant-garde author Robert Coover as he fails to care about  obstacles! Pass through the gnashing jaws of Jeremy Kyle! Eat asparagus  and organ meats to give yourself the condition that everybody's talking  about!\r\n  </p>\n<p>No offense is intended towards those who really suffer from gout.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Genres abound in this absurdist, experimental, but deeply playable game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Each short level is based upon one of the songs from Gout Pony's  first EP 'A Family Gouting'\u2122. Far more than an in-joke, yet so much less  than a real game, this may be the first genuine \"art game\"\u2122 to be  developed to be played alongside an EP and both game and EP can be  enjoyed together TODAY for -- no money -- ! The levels follow the track  listing (with track 8 as a *bonus level*) however the entire long-form  EP/ short-form LP has been converted to scintillating MIDI form for his/  her pleasure.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Listen to the album here:\r\n http://goutpony.bandcamp.com/album/a-family-gouting\r\n  </p>\n<p>And live the game!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c2925cf273c365c4bbc922ed56fd401c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adamwhybray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
