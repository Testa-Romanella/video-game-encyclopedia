Sounds easy right? (WRONG!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Super DEE is a FUN, exciting, challenging experience. With lots of cool mechanics like: jumping\u2026 and jumping to the right, to the left\u2026. And\u2026\u2026. more jumping! You get the idea. Avoid thousands of obstacles(or maybe just a few) and climb all the way to top to become the next super DEE master! It can be a little stressful at times BUT remember SUPER DEE is in the top 10\u2026.. thousand platformers ever created (not even close). So tell me! Are you ready to prove that you have what it takes to beat this kind of awesome game? YES, YOU ARE READY! So what are you waiting for? Let's get the party started!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T04:45:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67cedd8db54f9c2802338078293323b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the2Dude"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Leco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
