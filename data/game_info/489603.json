Having 3 bosses, each with a large arsenal of weaponry, you'll be on the edge of your seat trying to find a path to victory through a maze of bullets, lasers and more. If the game was too easy for you, try it out with the speed-run timer on and see if you can set a new record for yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please vote on this straw poll:</p>\n<p>https://strawpoll.com/ow8zcq5qr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d4/0d481319d326c4ebc73cf335832f0197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FourRooks"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
