I've oversimplified some parts (no pain, discomfort, multiple collection methods)\u00a0and definitely exaggerated others (you don't need to go Home every time!).\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Make it through the 5 days by doing enough Daily Tasks at Work, grabbing something to Eat at the Restaurant, having a Break at the Park - and most importantly - timing your Bathroom Breaks at Home! You will lose if you don't get enough Daily Tasks done, if you Starve or if you Leak too much.</p>\n<p>If you make it you will be able to see your performance.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun!\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong>: Arrows or WASD to move around\r\n</li><li><strong>Daily Tasks</strong>: Move or Press Space while in the Work area</li><li>Eat: Walk through the Restaurant</li><li>Have Fun: Walk through the Park</li><li>Bathroom: Walk by your Home</li></ul>\r\nTheme\r\n<p>This game was made for the Mini Jam 97. The theme was \u2018<strong>Simulation</strong>\u2019 and the limitation was \u2018<strong>Movement is Lethal</strong>\u2019.\r\n</p>\n<p>I decided to create a game that simulates going through a week, having to get the same done as usual but also dealing with your period on top of that. To apply the limitation, I made Movement advance time and fill your collection method which makes you lose if not managed.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets created by me unless listed below.\r\n</p>\n<p>Font: Amaranth (Google Fonts)\r\n</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>There are a few issues in the current Jam version:</p>\n<ul><li>Stuck on Day 6 - There's only 5 days, so the Day 6 screen is a bug which prevents the Results from showing. When you see the Day 6 screen, clicking any Arrow Key should trigger the results.</li><li>Small UI on some devices - In some devices (i.e. retina laptop) the UI can become very small or not fit into the browser window. Scrolling down should allow you to see it.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de9d6851e2c1c658e0ed1b45e30482f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["attahh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
