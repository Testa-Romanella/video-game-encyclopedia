Some say there are strange dimensions where reality is warped and the rules that hold space and time become more... accessible.<br/></p>\n<p>Either way, you will know.</p>\r\nKill space bugs\r\n<p>Insatiable creatures, dwellers of the unrandom zone. They know you are an anomaly and won't cease until they correct it. Take them all out every round.</p>\r\nDefy your fate\r\n<p>Each round your stats are randomised. Improve your dice by surviving wave after wave to increase your chances of getting a good roll.</p>\r\nChange your luck\r\n<p>But you are not completely alone. Some enemies will drop cards that you can use to modify your dice and rolls. There is no limit to the number of cards you can use and no maximum value. Smash your luck by smashing your limits and smash the unrandom critters with it.<br/></p>\r\nAnd do it again.\r\n<p>Improve your dice. Get better rolls. Use card after card and break the rules. Survive wave after wave becoming stronger after each one...\u00a0or trust a bad roll and die.</p>\n<p>Thank you for buying the new Tritonboy!\u00a0This retro console comes with the new <em>Nice Dice Twice!!</em> game preloaded and ready to play.
