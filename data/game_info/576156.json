It's time to save your queen from the hands of the evil KING PIG!</p>\n<p>Based on the Kings and Pigs Asset Pack (https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs), this short platformer was done mainly as a learning project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 3 levels, a final boss and two difficulty levels, Easy and Normal (even though I admit Normal can be a little too hard...). You start the game with basic skills and can improve them with the diamonds you collect along the way. There are also bugs! I believe there's nothing game breaking but any feedback is appreciated!\u00a0I hope you enjoy :)</p>\n<p>(The game was tested in screen resolutions ranging from 1366x768 to 1920x1080. Though not unplayable in resolutions out of this range, you may experience some visual glitches)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda1c0e75804fa68e833d94f64c20cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vondarth"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
