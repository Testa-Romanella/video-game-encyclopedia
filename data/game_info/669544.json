You are a lord who recently came to this place with his villagers.</p>\n<p>You need to learn the ways of survival. Then\u00a0teach them to the villagers.\u00a0How to gather, grow and construct...</p>\n<p>Become a proper society before the winter comes. All hands on deck, everybody will work for the necessary preparations.</p>\n<p>More you know as a leader, the better you can manage your people.</p>\n<p>Lead the way!</p>\r\n.\r\n<p><strong>* Increase the population up to 50 villagers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>* Gather 25000 resources for whole winter</strong></p>\n<p><strong>* Capture at least 75 resource points on the island</strong></p>\n<p><strong>* Learn 7 different ways of survival techniques\u00a0</strong></p>\n\r\n.\r\n-- Controls --\r\n<p><strong>Movement </strong>: AWSD</p>\n<p><strong>Jump </strong>: Space</p>\n<p><strong>Interact </strong>: Left\u00a0Mouse Click<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Evade </strong>: Right Mouse Click</p>\n<p>You can also connect a gamepad and play with that if you like. The control scheme should automatically detect it. I would still suggest sticking to the keyboard though :)</p>\r\n.\r\n-- Used Assets --\r\n<p>SYNTY Prototype &amp; Knight\u00a0Packages ( Soldier &amp; Building\u00a0Models )\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217\r\n</p>\n<p>Kevin Iglesias\u00a0Animation Package (\u00a0Villager Animations )\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/36307\r\n</p>\n<p>Low Poly Landscaping Tool ( Terrain-Water-Sky )\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/17305\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu music is from one my past jam friends.</p>\n<p>Willa Morgan\r\n</p>\r\n.\r\n-- Comments on Backtrace\u00a0--\r\n<p>It is a shame that I haven't used it before. I mostly use internal tools or Crashlytics for error reporting. But after trying Backtrace, I think I will give it a go on a bigger scale project for sure.</p>\n<p>It was super useful to be able to get insights from non-editor play sessions.\u00a0\u00a0With the manual reporting, you can even use it as a tracking tool rather than just for reporting \"errors\".</p>\n<p>Didn't have enough time to play with its docs. I am sure it has even more capabilities than what I have seen in this 2 day period. Can't wait to play with it more :)</p>\n\r\n-- Contact --\r\n<p>Ahmetahaydemir\r\n</p>\n<p>ahmetahaydemir@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/2385092448c340018c2821f3104edfe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmetahaydemir"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
