Then, you turn off your headlights and slowly idle your car back to the main road. Somewhere in between you'll find yourself between reality and something else altogether.</p>\n<p>My friends and I took a trip on this road back in 2016 but everything's been different since then. I still can't quite figure out what happened but even now they won't talk to me about it (or at all for that matter).</p>\n<p>I just thought I'd put this out there to give my side of the story before anyone tried to tell you different. Thanks for hearing me out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2efe5a9695ca364aa53579cbed259d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fia glas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
