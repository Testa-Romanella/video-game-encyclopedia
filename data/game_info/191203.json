It uses basic C# scripting to make a finite state machine, which powers the game. It's easily extendable and easy to customize. I recommend the course if you are at least mildly comfortable with coding concepts.</p>\n<p>HEAD'S UP: This game has no win-state. It's very basic, and is designed to restart when you reach an end state. I made this a feature by tying it into the story :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c3e066c4b49571fba8cde2e26d4e2db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard Mitchell"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
