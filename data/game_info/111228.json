He's a bit weird, living alone in the mountains.<br/>\r\nAnd he loves to get a drink every now and then in the local village's tavern.<br/>\r\nHis drinking buddies like him, the other town people not so much.<br/>\r\nYet he dreams of another life of fame and wealth, such as the adventures he can hear from time to time while drinking in town.</p>\n</li><li><strong>Telena</strong>\n<p>A simple human girl. She loves to read stories from books and doesn't go out that much.<br/>\r\nShe lives alone in a small town. People like her for she's a quiet neighbour.<br/>\r\nAt least once in her life, she'd like to live some exciting adventure and find some forgotten treasures.</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look at my project. Nothing fancy here, but I'll do my best to make it an enjoyable experience with a lot of replayability.\r\nHope you'll enjoy playing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ff9e74ec14d227450771c6409100305.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TWings"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
