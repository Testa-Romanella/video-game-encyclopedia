But when he digs into a labyrinthine dungeon in search\r\n of a nebulous evil presence, he finds that identifying who can be \r\ntrusted is as much a challenge as avoiding death at the hands of the \r\ndungeon's bizarre monstrosities.  'Down We Go!' is a gradual\r\n crescendo of manic FPS action, mistrust, and facepalming.  A zany \r\nRoguelite/FPS/Adventure hybrid with funky tunes, a retro visual style, \r\nrandom generation, pumpkins, Mary Queen of Scots, and just a little bit \r\nof looting.</p><p>Visit my blog at http://ironsnowflakes.blogspot.com/ and follow me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jefequeso</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f10fdea8bc921c4c76e2bc6ab67fddfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Szymanski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
