This is a simple arcade shooter game where every bullet shot flies around the planet, and you must target your attackers just right whilst dodging their circling bullets. This was created in under a week by myself as a little test to improve my ability to actually finish my projects :D.</p><p>Move with the arrow keys and shoot with LMB. Or if using a gamepad, A is to shoot. Thanks for checking out my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/3424edaaaaed87b4ba88dc3ae45eaae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Penberthy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
