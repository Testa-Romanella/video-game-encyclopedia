And mostly importantly: Unlock new unique weapons each with thier unique ability. Combine them into your dream set, either you feel like taking any boss's attack while laughing, or one shotting anything that is on your way. The choice is up to you. And perhaps you want to be a hardcore gamer, only using the starter set without leveling up your stats.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe point is, you can play the game in multiple ways, and it might be tons of fun? Try it out!<br/>\r\n(The game is still not nearly finished, currently there are 2 zones. The final plan is to have 8 and much more unique items.
