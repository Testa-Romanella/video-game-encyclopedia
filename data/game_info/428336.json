Fire a cannonball through a variety of obstacles to reach the target. In each level, you are given a set amount of 'bumpers' - items that change the cannonball's trajectory. Bumpers can be placed freely to help you solve the puzzle and destroy the target!  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor an extra challenge, go for Mastery! Levels are mastered by beating the level on your first shot using all your bumpers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T15:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/326088ca1da4810e5a3b6191f393c41d.jpg", "website": "https://www.bcsgames.com/cranky-cannon", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BCS Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BCS Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
