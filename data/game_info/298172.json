It takes some getting used to these sorts of changes, but it can be incredibly freeing, particularly for people who may not have felt at home where they were before.</p>\n<p>This game aims to be inclusive and as such we have decided to avoid using gendered pronouns and traditional expectations of sexuality.<br/>It's 2019, baby. Gender is out and puzzle\u00a0games are in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e5111730bc798fb542176f3bd9aa7abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ellie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
