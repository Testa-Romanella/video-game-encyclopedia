Almost all of the things you will see, hear, and read throughout this visual novel are created by tools that you yourself can access, mostly for free.\r\n</p>\n<p>All of the characters and backgrounds were created using an AI image generator.\u00a0All of the music was composed using a neural network.\r\nAlmost all of the writing in this project was done by various online writers and plot generators.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Of course, human intervention occurred throughout every step of the process, but in terms of pure content creation, the majority of this project is machine-generated! If that sounds at all interesting to you and you aren't too disturbed with the idea of reading through dozens of pages of complete nonsense, then please consider downloading!
