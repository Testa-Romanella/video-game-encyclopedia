I call my floating heads Assholeroids. When you shoot one it screams out and explodes in blood. How fun is that?! Bloody Roids!</p><p>The game has 10 unique levels: 8 regular levels and 2 bonus rooms where you shoot planets for extra points. There is a high score board to keep track of how good you are at shooting Assholeroids too!</p><p>All the sounds and music are 100% original; even the fart sound when the butt flies around space. If you spin the Butt just right you can make green gas spew out of it too!</p><p>I really hope you enjoy my first game Assholeroids. If you do, I would appreciate a small donation to help fund my next game. Or, just tell a friend about my stupid Butt shooting poop space game! </p><p>Let me know what you think by Tweeting me @odddustin or commenting below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c93850410c9d1a02c892acd20a2e69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddFamily"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
