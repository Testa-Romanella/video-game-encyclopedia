You play a small green square called Zed, find powerups and stomp on goomba like enemies, try to survive the competition.</p><p>Tombsday is my first ever game project. The art and sprites are all produced by me as well as the sound effects courtesy of bfxr.net. The music is royalty free, I would like to produce my own when the core game is complete. The coding knowledge was provided by my college course in computing science. This is a fun first experience in making games and I hope my skills will improve as my experience grows. Appreciate any feedback. </p><p>Email me at: jakecampbell105@gmail.com</p><p>Jake Campbell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d431a08d7c008a21234d08ddc9f8ba9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake Campbell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
