You can replay the dungeons on their own and see what your highest score is.</p>\n<p>In the overworld you can find shopkeepers who will sell you keys to progression along with various other types of items, <br/>or you can find other ways to progress...</p>\n<p>The small free demonstration here  will only have the most basic mechanics in mind in this short dungeon. Likely in the near future however, when I finish recreating this demo with better scripts and a more clear vision for organization, followers on buymeacoffee will get new dungeons to play as they're made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T03:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca3913080b1388be0d0cfc8cb947225e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AVALON-P"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
