To avoid Mars\u2019 high radiation levels and inhospitable temperature changes, he built a city underground. This city was named Mars MPO. Free of the constraints that often plagued businesses and researchers on Earth, scientists and entrepreneurs flocked to MPO.<br/><br/>Recently, Dr. Albert West has migrated to MPO at the personal invitation of Mr. Murray. West has been working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease in a race to save his wife, Jennifer, from dementia. His efforts are cut short; a lab accident leads to an accusation of murder and a prompt prison sentence.<br/><br/>We join Dr. West a little over a year into his prison sentence. It\u2019s been a week since the guards mysteriously vanished. Dr. West is about to find out why.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-25T12:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8c140c8f801c03d12c9f9bb6209627d.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixellore.com/games/subterrain/", "rating": 3.08, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 72, "owned": 930, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 11, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 229, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixellore"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixellore"], "esrb_rating": null}
