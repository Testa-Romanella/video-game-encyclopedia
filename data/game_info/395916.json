Basically, it's the Gameboy version of Tetris, but with a twist.</p>\n<p>Instead of interlocking tetrominoes together, the goal of this game is to stack horizontal blocks on top of each other to create a <strong>Tower</strong> as high as possible.</p>\n<p>The blocks will bounce from side to side and you have to place them at the right time, so that they have at least one block supporting them. Once you reach the top of the screen, the view transitions upwards, and the game continues.</p>\n<p>In gamemode <strong>A-Type</strong>, every few transitions will make the game progress to the next level. Each successive level will make the blocks move faster and faster, making it harder to time the placement. The game will continue forever until you lose.</p>\n<p>In gamemode <strong>B-Type</strong>, you can choose a specific speed and block length. The goal is to create a Tower that is 180 blocks high. Once that's completed, you will be shown a different victory screen, depending on the difficulty of the chosen setup.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>On Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Z</strong> - Selects something <em>(Simulates </em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em> Button)</em>.</li><li><strong>X</strong> - Cancels or goes back <em>(Simulates </em><strong><em>B</em></strong><em> Button)</em>.</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> - Confirms and/or progresses to next screen <em>(Simulates </em><strong><em>Start</em></strong><em> Button)</em>.</li><li><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Move selection (Simulates<strong> D-Pad</strong>).</li></ul>\n<p>On Gamepad:</p>\n<p><strong><em>(Make sure to enable gamepad controls first in the options menu)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>(These controls can also be customised, these are the defaults)</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Button 2 [B or Circle]</strong> - Selects something <em>(Simulates </em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em> Button)</em>.</li><li><strong>Button 1 [A or Cross]</strong> - Cancels or goes back <em>(Simulates </em><strong><em>B</em></strong><em> Button)</em>.</li><li><strong>Start</strong> - Confirms and/or progresses to next screen.</li><li><strong>D-Pad or Left Analog Stick</strong> - Move selection.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b125ecd1d50c91e59936e965aa73c163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lil'Alien"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
