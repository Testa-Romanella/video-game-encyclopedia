{"id": 820936, "slug": "dice-lands", "name": "Dice Lands", "name_original": "Dice Lands", "description": "<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the Dice Lands! This world is created by the sheer luck of the draw, or in this case the luck of the roll. Fortunately, as the player, you have the dice in hand. Throw them and gain a tile to place in the Dice Lands. Place the tile and repeat the process, until you roll the highest roll possible with your current dice. In this case you are rewarded for your luck, and your old die gets replaced by a better one (thus gaining access to new tiles!). This repeats until you have the almighty d20, from which you have access to all the tiles. So go on and start creating your world in the Dice Lands. Don't forget to visit your tiles up close, as they have some nice ambient sound. Keep in mind that this game has no goal other than what your mind wants to make.<br/></p>\n<p>Press space to roll the dice!
