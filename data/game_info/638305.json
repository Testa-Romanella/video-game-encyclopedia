It was done in school, over the period of 6 hours. There were 3 of us in the team.</p>\n<p>I came up with the game concept, and coded everything except the player controller.</p>\n<p>Elric coded the player controller, created the particle effects and did the level design.</p>\n<p>Diana created the assets that were used in the game.</p>\n<p>All in all I think it turned out pretty well for our first ever game jam. It's quite surprising just how much work you can get done in 6 hours when push comes to shove.</p>\n<p>As always, C&amp;C is welcoe, but it is extremely unlikely that I will ever return to this project.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-WASD/arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>-Space bar to deploy the umbrella</p>\n<p>-Q to quit game</p>\n<p>-R to play again.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out mates!</p>\n<p>Andrew.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/61678055931e309842b60f176a49390b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Spinks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
