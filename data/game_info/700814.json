You'll have to download the \"Claw Fish | Love2d\" file, unzip it, and then download Love2d to run it. This game uses love 0.10.2 (Super Toast), so if you don't already have that installed, go over there and install it. All you have to do then is drag the .love file onto the love.exe file that you downloaded just now. I've included the windows version of love2d in the download, but if you're not using windows, you'll have to download Love2d.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c02fbff68405d07cda53881f0455ab46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Samalander"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
