There are two keys in the game and they change. Try to collect the diamonds in the level and move on to the next level. This prototype game currently has 15 levels. It is a puzzle game I made to learn Unity. If you like it, I am considering redoing the game from the beginning with better drawings, sounds, mechanics, and maybe even a story to enrich the game. I look forward to your comments.</strong></p><p>twitter</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T05:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a3/2a36c91a983c13de6b1cc0f973a9d790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emreDGame"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
