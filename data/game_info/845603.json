If you don't match the frequency,\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>then you will suffer!\r\n</p><p><strong>Core Loop:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You control a white colored blinded Samurai\r\n<ul><li>Use WASD keys to move\r\n</li><li>Use J key to Attack\r\n</li></ul></li><li><strong>Objective </strong>- To complete a level, you have to defeat all Enemies in that level and proceed to the next level (since you are an apprentice and your training is to defeat all opposing Samurais)\r\n</li><li>Attacking functionality:\r\n<ul><li>Go near an Enemy or an Obstacle (the red rock)\r\n<ul><li>(Enemies will come in an \u201calert position\u201d when you approach them)\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Now you\u2019re supposed to attack when your weapon\u2019s Frequency (shown in top right in the HUD) matches the Enemy\u2019s (shown above his head) or the Obstacles\u2019 (also shown above the red rock)\r\n</li></ul></li><li>2 Weapon Skins:\r\n<ul><li>Main weapon - Red Tuning Fork Sword\r\n<ul><li>Fixed Freq\r\n</li><li>Will be with Player in the start of any Level, any random allotted Freq value\r\n</li><li>Can Damage both types of Enemy by matching Enemy\u2019s Frequency\r\n</li><li>Can Damage Obstacle only if both have it and Obstacles have same Frequency\r\n<ul><li>In case both don\u2019t have same Frequency, then Player will have to get Golden sword\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Secondary weapon - Golden coloured skin\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Variable Frequency\r\n</li><li>Get by defeating Golden Enemies\r\n</li><li>Destroy Obstacles (red rocks) by matching Frequency of it with Obstacle\u2019s\r\n<ul><li>If Frequency does not match, then Sword reverts back to original Red skin\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Can damage Golden Enemy with no Frequency match needed - thus a Power Up\r\n</li><li>Can\u2019t damage Red Enemy with this - thus also a debuff\r\n<ul><li>So to damage Red Enemies <strong>you must get your weapon\u2019s Red skin back</strong>\n<ul><li>To do this, you have go near the Obstacle and match wrong frequency intentionally to change the Sword back to Red as mentioned above\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Obstacle Interaction:\r\n<ul><li>Obstacles simply have a Freq Bar above them\r\n<ul><li>They will have fixed Frequency\r\n</li><li>But each such Obstacle will have a different Resonant Frequency\r\n</li><li>If the Freq is not Matching, Player has to make his weapon Golden i.e. get Variable Frequency by defeating a Golden Enemy\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Then Player has to match his Golden Weapon\u2019s Frequency with the Obstacle\u2019s to destroy it\r\n<ul><li>If Player had matched Golden weapon\u2019s variable Frequency correctly with the Obstacle, the Obstacle gets destroyed\r\n</li><li>If Player had not matched Golden weapon\u2019s Frequency correctly with the Obstacle\u2019s, the weapon reverts back to original Red skin and then Player has to defeat another Golden Enemy to make the weapon Golden again\r\n<ul><li>However this situation can be useful when the Player has to defeat Red Enemy, he can intentionally mismatch the Frequency and get his weapon reverted to original red colour, as only red weapon can damage the Red Enemy and the Golden one can\u2019t do so\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Enemy interaction:\r\n<ul><li>Both Enemies (Red and Golden) will have variable Frequency\r\n</li><li>Red Enemy:\r\n<ul><li>Can only be damaged by Player\u2019s Red Weapon\r\n</li><li>Player needs to match his Red Weapon\u2019s fixed Frequency with this Enemy\u2019s Variable Frequency to damage him\r\n<ul><li>If mismatch, then he will damage the Player\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Golden Enemy:\r\n<ul><li>Can be damaged by Player\u2019s both Red and Golden Weapon\r\n<ul><li>However attacking by Golden Weapon will give Player an advantage - can defeat Enemy regardless of the Frequency match mechanism\r\n</li></ul></li><li>In case attacked with Player\u2019s Red Weapon, then like Red Enemy,\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Player needs to match his Golden Weapon\u2019s fixed Frequency with this Enemy\u2019s Variable Frequency to damage him\r\n</li><li>If there is mismatch, then he will damage the Player\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>If you want to play new version here it is\u00a0</p>\n<p>it is uploaded after some time later when\u00a0game jam was over (notice :Game jam version also fine but it got more polishing)</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jhfWCyU-zM9FsNGsiPBCsqWv2ilDVHTt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T15:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/8950139a3e558bd73eb01d6aacd076b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RageDude", "vineetm1471013", "SudeepG"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
