He recently learned that some silent investors for a small pizza restaurant have secretly hidden their tax returns deep in a privately owned local uranium mine. He insisted on revealing the source of their dirty money to the public and it\u2019s gotten him into some hot water. He snuck his way inside the mine, found out where they keep the records, and just before he strapped the documents to his back in preparation to leave, he thought \u201cWill this be a worthwhile escape?\u201d He then enthusiastically blindfolded himself for added danger! He didn\u2019t know you were coming to help, he barely knows you\u2019re there, and he doesn\u2019t think he needs you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guide and protect Ramen during his passage through the dangerous valley. Keep him alive so the truth about those crooks can be brought to light.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/89016708fe251d8a7e2efb301a439fe7.jpg", "website": "https://kunihideliao.wixsite.com/oishiiramen", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 321, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChaoYe Liu", "Loxodonta"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Loxodonta", "Happy Home Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
