We wanted there to be a growing number of residents in the house (hence the unused UI on the left) who would have a happiness stat, which could be raised by giving them furniture. We ran out of time, so here's an incomplete version of the game, with a few graphical glitches. We hope you still enjoy the graphics, music, and barebones gameplay anyways! :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Selecting the furniture items only works some of the time.</p>\n<p>2. Items larger than one block do not snap to the grid properly.</p>\n<p>3. Some missing features, including redundant UI for a tenant and happiness system.</p>\n<p>4. Some objects place on top of each other.</p>\n<p>5. Total income on the Game Over screen is maintained between attempts.</p><p>6. You can place furniture in the same block twice.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1f8b9ad2df81524644e2dda94e838e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ericli3690"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
