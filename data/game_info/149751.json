I had to create this game for my game design class.</p>\n<p>The task was, to create any kind of game that is an adaption to the novel \"The Old Man and the Sea\" by Ernest Hemingway.</p>\n<p>I chose the theme of a trial, because in my interpretation the trial fits best of what will happen with the old man in the novel. He has to use all his strenght over exhausting hours to catch the marlin, just to lose it to the everlasting struggle of the ocean.</p>\n<p>I was also inspired by the awesome oil painting animation \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ih1IRIRxI\" directed by Aleksandr Petrov. You can see this somehow in the chosen art style.</p>\n<p>You control the game with wasd to move and the mouse to look around. Click the left mouse button to advance during the dialog phase.</p>\n<p>Try to find all hidden messages and methaphorical similarities :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy this modern reinterpretation of the novel!</p>\n<p>Note: The long walking sequence is intentional for the game's feeling, but if you want to skip it, press the right shift button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b36f3945df3f4bdd71d6bccbcd9cddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Djamel Berkaoui"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
