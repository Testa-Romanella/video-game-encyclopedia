When I say \u201cexpanded\u201d I don\u2019t mean by a lot. There are only 2 bosses in total (as of this release) and you can\u2019t travel back and forth across locations. However it follows the theme of evolution pretty well as there is a hidden story beyond what you are told up front. I can\u2019t tell you everything but I can tell you three vague clues: Primitive period, toxic era, and present day. But not OUR present day.</p><p>Controls: left arrow: move left, right arrow: move right, up arrow: move up, down arrow: move down, E to interact, I to open inventory, backspace to close inventory, Double click attack moves to attack\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T09:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/1690a31f67fcc0593164df6fa7b98d43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Damiansgaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
