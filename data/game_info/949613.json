Unfortunately, they can't navigate around the world, so they rely on mimicking the movement of objects around them.</p>\n<p>You can select as many objects as you like, combining the unique movement patterns to launch, push, and swing Cyan in all directions.</p>\r\nWith that, get out there and explore the world!\r\n\n<p><strong><em>Warning: The game may cause motion sickness for some people; especially when Cyan is connected to several objects at the same time and moves very quickly. So, please stop playing if you don't feel well.</em></strong><br/></p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Game Designer and Character Modeler:\u00a0</strong>Logan Mulder</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer:</strong> Chandler Shi</p>\n<p><strong>Level Designer:\u00a0</strong>Valerie Chen</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Designer:\u00a0</strong>Daniel Thomas</p>\n<p><strong>Composer and Sound Designer:\u00a0</strong>Ali Saneei<br/><br/><br/>The assets used are free assets downloaded from\u00a0https://kenney.nl/.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Special Thanks to:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JT Hampson</strong>\u00a0for proposing the tethering effect.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>And everyone who made this game better by giving us valuable feedback.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ma</strong><strong>de during the Design Week of Winter 2023, Honours Bachelor of Game Design, Sheridan College.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n\n\r\nOST:\r\n<p>Listen to \"Xyporia\" OST on SoundCloud:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/alisaneei/xyporia?si=977ee9716df645b68949b9d7a6dcd045&amp;utm...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T18:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d62ab939c8dfed0874c87a912dce6d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali Saneei"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
