Each player will summon elements to cast a projectile against their opponent, or defend themselves from spells. </p>\n<p>By defending, the player can either absorb the attack (taking no damage and nullifying the spell) or reflect the spell against the opponent, making it faster and stronger. </p>\n<p>To absorb an attack, simply press the absorb key without summoning any element. To reflect, you must summon the same element as the projectile you want to reflect, and press the absorb key.</p>\n<p><strong>The\u00a0Team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Giovanni Tagliaro - Art</li><li>Khin Baptista - Programming</li><li>Marcelo Vasques - Programming</li><li>Andrei Aguiar M\u00fcller - Sound</li><li>Leonardo Tagliaro - Programming</li></ul>\n<p><strong>This game was developed during the Global Game Jam 2016, in the Unisinos Porto Alegre Jam Site.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/16115bac3a3d8b13d87eb0bdda4b6b58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Leonardo Tagliaro"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
