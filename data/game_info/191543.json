The further Gilgamesh traverses into the level the faster and harder each step becomes.</p>\n<p>The controlling forces keep Gilgamesh under control and at arms length to his dream. The Over ruling AI taunts and adjusts the difficulty level the longer and harder Gilgamesh fights. Ultimately the city of post-topia is never attainable, no matter how much money Gilgamesh earns or how many upgrades he gains, \u00a0the machines always win in the end.\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Our project is about the predicament individuals face in post late-stage capitalism where they are compelled to become transhuman by accepting proprietary \u2018upgrades\u2019 (pharma, mecha and neural cyborgism) offered and controlled by non-allied others.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We came to this during our investigation into cyborgism, transhumanism and posthumanism.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To elaborate; in an AI-assisted techno-capitalist society such as the one some contemporary voices predict we are heading towards or are already living in, individuals are compelled through competition to compete against AI machines by undergoing medical and mechanical upgrades to their bodies. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Some upgrades work and some do not, some cause conflict with other modifications and some fail to do anything at all. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thus most people are left with the choice of dropping out of society or conforming to a system that will systematically destroy them.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Matt Young -\u00a0\u00a0Programmer / Level Design / Build / Asset Creation</p>\n<p>Adam Timol -\u00a0\u00a0Audio / Sound FX / Research / Narrative</p>\n<p>Benny Xu -\u00a0\u00a0Intro Animation</p>\n<p>Luciana Vessalius -\u00a0\u00a0Asset Creation</p>\n\n<p>Made with -\u00a0Unity 2017.2.0f3</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a02018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d956c74e4be137fce8fcd57127423300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MK Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
