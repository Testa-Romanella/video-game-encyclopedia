This lab prototype has a limited range and can't hurt a fly, but the laser beam has curious extraphysical properties such as bouncing further upon hitting glass/mirrors and allowing the wielder to do a fast zoom to the end of the laser beam.</p>\n<p>Originally intended for this to be a parody of Portal with more background story and more levels but I've scaled it down and it has 3 levels for now. Might develop this further if there's more interest as all the pieces are there.<br/></p><p>Controls are your usual FPS type of WASD keys.</p><p>Space to jump. E to interact. Z to go into bullet time mode, left click to zoom.\u00a0</p><p>Use V to switch \u00a0between first and third person camera and mouse scroll to control the third person camera zoom distance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f13fb25a8739497e48525c80ee5dc02f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["randomphantom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
