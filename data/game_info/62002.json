Its as simple as that, and thats how it was made. From the beginning our intention was to not offer any controller support to give every casual player a level playing field. Its also more fun for just a quick race, no need to spend time setting up any controllers!Simple RatingSimple Rating is an individual player rank that goes from 0 to 99. Everyone starts on 45, but depending on whether you finish or not your races and drive cleanly this can rise and fall. Simple Rating is visible to all players in a lobby.Developer and Future UpdatesAs Simple Racing is a hobby project and therefore an indie game, updates will be small and irregular. However, there is already a plan to add wet weather races and different tyres! Dont be panicked though if it takes time because this is a side project I have been working on while in middle school.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67eac454e54097550010234632545f70.jpg", "website": "https://www.simpleracing.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Simple Racing"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Simple Racing"], "esrb_rating": null}
