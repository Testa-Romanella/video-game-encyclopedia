It will take\u00a03 waves to do that (plus half a wave\u00a0as a little tutorial)\u00a0but don't think it's over then. We tried to design our game as a little yet reach experience, so wave-defense is followed by the\u00a0diligently made boss fight. We hope you enjoy the landscapes of our mesmerizing Sunset Forest throughout your story here.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls and How to Skip Tutorial</strong></p>\n<p>Basics:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow-keys for movement</li><li>LMB - Attack</li><li>RMB - Push (has way more applications then it seems to)</li><li>Space - Jump (and again to double-jump, btw you can attack in air)</li><li>Shift - Dash (backwards, if pressed without movement)</li><li>Tab - Open\u00a0Bestiary (when the\u00a0corresponding button pops up in the upper-left corner of your screen)</li></ul>\n<p>Configurable controls (actually you can also turn the laptop mode to configure attack and push from mouse buttons to\u00a0keys):</p>\n<ul><li>S - Interaction</li><li>QWER - Skills</li></ul>\n<p><em>To Skip Tutorial:\u00a0</em>if you go to the right side you will find a stone burriend in the ground. Jump near it, when you fall down it will pop up, while it's in the air press your Right Mouse Button so you push the stone.<br/></p>\n<p><em>To skip whatever content of cutscene use Space/Enter/LMB.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank YOU</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for coming across our game's page. We will be truly grateful, if you downlaod and try playing our game. We are a team of quite young developers and this is our first game and to be honest: we put our hearts and souls in it (and that's if we don't speak abot time). Yet we still distribute it's full version for free. If you decide to help us a little, you will get a game version with debug features enabled as a little reward.</p>\n<p><em>Have a nice game!
