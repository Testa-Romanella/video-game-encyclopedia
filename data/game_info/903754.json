There is no set when and where for this momentous event. No red circled reminder on a calendar, no ear-marked page on a journal. There is no indicator for the last time you\u2019ll ever meet someone. Only the memory of it, after it\u2019s all over.\r\n\r\n\n\n<strong>Story by Caednis\u2014</strong>\u00a0Twitter<br/><strong>Music and SFX by Paul Orsoni\u2014\u00a0</strong><em>Website, Twitter</em><br/><strong>Code and VFX\u00a0by microAeris\u2014\u00a0</strong><em>Website, Twitter\u00a0<br/><strong>Art\u00a0by\u00a0DacuriBlue\u2014\u00a0</strong>Website<em>,\u00a0</em>Twitter<em>, Twitter2</em></em><br/><strong>Kiss\u00a0Animation\u00a0by LemonaPink\u2014\u00a0</strong><em>Website, Twitter</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fceee41130b7bfbbd98e6e6a6a09b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Aeris", "DacuriBlue", "Caednis", "Paul Orsoni", "LemonaPink"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
