This is a narrative game experiment.</p>\n<p>Basically I want to make my previous twine game more interesting. So I want to present the environment, sound, color, mood or even temperature with art instead of text description. Right now it only includes 3 scenes, and the branching options are not exactly branching.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's just an interesting experiment. Hope you all enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:53:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f8093611571a1bb800c44b26c7dbd796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RenaGu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
