You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll remember just how much fun you can have walking down the street.\u200b<br/><br/>Remember: Don't step on the cracks or you'll fall and break your back!<br/><br/>-------------------<br/>FEATURES<br/>-------------------<br/>-  Hilarious physics<br/>-  Endless gameplay action<br/>-  Thousands of character customization options<br/>-  6 different game modes and challenges<br/>-  Did we mention EXPLODING SIDEWALKS?<br/><br/><br/>Made with love by @stephen_last and @shathatron\u200b<br/><br/>P.S. Steppy Pants uses some special permissions to help things run smoothly and to allow certain social services (like sending selfies), but you don't have to use them if you don't want to!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/59248b43a0c5facf258b3c8ac1b2e5fb.jpeg", "website": "http://steppypants.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Super Entertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["S Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
