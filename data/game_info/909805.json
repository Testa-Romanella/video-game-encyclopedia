{"id": 909805, "slug": "terfenstein-3d", "name": "Terfenstein 3D", "name_original": "Terfenstein 3D", "description": "<strong>Terfenstein 3D</strong> is a first-person shooter game with a retro style from the early '90s. Consider it a creative iteration mix of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom 1. You will be progressing through seven levels of increasing difficulty and complexity with a set of six classical weapons arsenal and five traditional enemies.<br/><br/>The game offers LGBTQAI+, transgender, and feminist themes of gender-critical people and what a post-war apocalyptic world would look like if gender fascists won.  In this dystopian world, fascists have killed and imprisoned all transgender and queer people, subjecting them to harsh conversion therapy, imprisonment, and death. You play as an escapee fleeing their detention center, while you exact your revenge.<br/>This game brings to light the very real transphobic violence many transgender people face for just existing. And draw a comparison between gender critics and nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Developed over four months, this solo project is one of many controversial games the developer has made. Being able to artistically express yourself is a proven way to heal trauma and possibly also move on. This game also hopes to achieve that for players who need it through gameplay that would stir up hidden and muddied emotions. <br/>Please take care of yourself and your loved ones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T04:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecb1b5a3aadc088a592c60aae3e5d857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandra Moen"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sandra Moen"], "esrb_rating": null}
