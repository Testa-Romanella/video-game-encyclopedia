{"id": 158074, "slug": "echo-tactics", "name": "Echo Tactics", "name_original": "Echo Tactics", "description": "<p>Echo Tactics was a team project developed in late 2016 at RIT's Game Design and Development Masters program. Nathaniel Blair produced. Jon Pulsipher designed. Akshay Rachapudi and Rahul Madyan programmed. Hat-swapping was common.</p>\n<p>You play as survivors of a botched experiment that left miles of the surrounding area connected with a hostile alien world. Trek through your world and theirs, fending off grotesque abominations to survive.</p>\n<p>Echo Tactics sprang from two questions:\u00a0\"What would it be like to play Chess on both sides of the board?\" and \"Have you seen Stranger Things yet?\" Many on the team had played and enjoyed Turn-based Tactics like X-Com and Final Fantasy Tactics. We were also\u00a0excited by the challenge of making a player view that could display both sides of the board simultaneously.</p>\n<p>In developing the game, we chose to draw inspiration from Rogue-like survival games like FTL. Players are pressured to move forward by\u00a0a wave of fatal static that advances each turn. They can choose to walk on the safer earth-side or more dangerous alien-side, but can be forced to choose danger to chase after\u00a0pieces of the key to the next level.</p>\n<p>Early designs of the game were communicated through a shared wiki, but we found it more convenient to write up targeted miniature design docs for each milestone. I've uploaded our final mini design doc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02b4302bc5275f3ca2e9c6d4d07b7102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonapulse"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
