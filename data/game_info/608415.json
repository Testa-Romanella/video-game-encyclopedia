The problem is dangerous asteroids might get into your way during your space blueberry harvest. Luckily your civilization developed powerful rocket engines. If you go faster, time moves slower for you, as seen by others. That means your blueberry supply lasts longer, but all other objects move faster as well. <br/></p>\n<p>Explore space and <strong>try to collect as many blueberries as you can</strong> before you run out of them or collide with any asteroids. (it might take some exploring before you find some blueberries)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use your move to move the spaceship.</li><li>The farther you move your mouse away from your ship, the faster you go!</li><li>Beware: As you go faster, your sense of time changes. Other objects appear to move faster. The blueberry supply lasts equally long, no matter how fast you go.</li></ul>\n<p>Disclamer: I don't know physics, I just watched a 2 minute video on YouTube about spacetime<br/><br/>Let me know your highscore in the comments! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/edac85b37d18838adb7c96a916355f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Centi Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
