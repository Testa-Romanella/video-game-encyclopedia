The first game was released in 1982. It was then ported to most home computers during the 1980s and spawned several sequels: Football Manager 2 (1988) and Football Manager World Cup Edition (1990), both designed by Kevin Toms, and finally Football Manager 3 (1992), without Toms' involvement. Football Manager 3 sold poorly, and as a result the series came to an end. The series was claimed to have sold over a million copies by 1992. The game was to start a whole new genre of computer game, the football management simulation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T07:57:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd219310c0a349063da11e9b296a4498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit", "PC"], "developers": ["Addictive Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Addictive Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
