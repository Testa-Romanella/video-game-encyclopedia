You can score up to 100 points on each level by collecting all the coins, or, on level 36, by not dying. Use \"WASD\", arrow keys, or a\u00a0remote controller to move. To wall-jump, you just have to touch the wall and jump... but only while you are off the ground. If you are on the ground and touching a wall, you cannot jump. This is not a bug. It is a bug-fix. Just move away from the wall and you can jump again. Also, to use the grappling hook, click on one of the green square thingies. Don't get confused, level 35 is different every time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To use the controller to move, read the following:</p>\n<p>Left - The first left button on the top of the controller</p>\n<p>Right - The first right button on the top of the controller</p>\n<p>Jump - The far right button (\"A\" on Nintendo remote)<br/></p>\n<p>Grappling hook - Button above and to the left of the jump button (\"X\" on Nintendo remote) when you are close to a green square thingy</p>\n<p>Settings - The button with a minus ( - ) on it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:01:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enganmar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
