Establish synergies between your cards and treasures to create the strongest army!</p><p>Build a deck from selections of random cards, and during combat each card is played in a random position on the field. Cards synergize with each other based on things like their relative position, faction, type, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an early alpha demo of the game--most of the artwork is placeholder (there are only a few cards with proper artwork) and the balance of the game will shift significantly throughout development! There are probably some card and treasure interactions that cause bugs or crashes. The game takes inspiration from other deck builders like M<em>onster Train</em> and L<em>uck be a Land Lord.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>100+ Unique Cards</li><li>25+ Treasure items</li><li>Tons of card synergies</li><li>3 factions</li><li>2 Player Generals</li><li>Enemy sabotage cards</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Read the Readme.txt for tips on how to play!\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music: [One Bard Band] by Alexander Nakarada (www.serpentsoundstudios.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons BY Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you enjoy the game, please wishlist it on steam to support its development!\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69773274671aba4d08e82576f97c984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bleem"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
