I got to choose the game Bombs Away, since I have always enjoyed minigames similar to this one.</p>\n<p>Bombs Away is a 4-player minigame in which the goal is to stay on the island. A\u00a0ship appears in the background which shoots cannonballs towards the island. The impact of the cannonballs add a force to the island which makes it tilt accordingly. You can jump on and bump into other hamsters to make their life just a bit more difficult. Make sure you are not touching the ground when a cannonball hits the island, or else you'll get stunned and you have to wiggle your way out! At the end there is a little surprise where a torpedo hits the island from below blasting the players up into the air. Make sure you land back on the island if you want to win!</p>\r\nBonus info\r\n<p>The game can both be played with a keyboard or a controller. Upon reaching the character select menu, click either a button on your keyboard or your controller to join the lobby. Up to 4 players can play the game locally. Once everyone readied up (by pressing the action key), any of the players can press the action key to start the game. If the lobby is not filled up with players, the other remaining spots will get filled by computers.</p>\r\nControls\r\nControllerKeyboardMovementLeft JoystickWASDAction key/jumpA\u00a0key (xbox), X key (playstation)Spacebar\r\n<p>If you get stunned by a hamster landing on the platform, either rapidly press A, then D, then A, then D, etc. if you are using keyboard, or rapidly move your joystick from left to right, left to right, etc. if you're using a controller.<br/></p>\r\nYouTube devlog\r\n\r\nSocials\r\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/GoldenEvolution<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/GoIdenEvolution</p>\r\nCollab games/videos\r\n<p>Games:\u00a0https://itch.io/c/1811534/game-devs-remake-mario-party<br/>Videos:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLaoTkkqsLdrg-Kxq14NPy2YOS-5ssAvI</p>\r\nDevlogs Club\r\n<p>This game was made as part of a challenge\u00a0hosted by Jirushi and the Devlogs Club \u2013 which consists of BLANKdev, Whateep, and Andrew David.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can check out their content here:\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Devlogs Club Channel:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UC-7VQ2Lf6r81I6-2y007EHg\u00a0<br/>Devlogs Club website:\u00a0https://devlogs.club/<br/>Jirushi:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UCuVScY6j4BMOMzeK6yPiLSQ\u00a0<br/>BLANKdev:\u00a0https://youtube.com/BLANKdev\u00a0<br/>Whateep:\u00a0https://youtube.com/whateep\u00a0<br/>AndrewDavidJ:\u00a0https://youtube.com/andrewdavidj</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/0939c480dc807d7540a753bd6a84def6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GoldenEvolution"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
