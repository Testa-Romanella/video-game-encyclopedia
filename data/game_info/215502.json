But even then it's not finished. If it were finished, the real description would be the following:</p>\n<p>The skate series uses the FlickIt system to map the tricks to the analog stick (move the stick in a way similar to moving your feet on the skateboard). This proved to be a great idea since\u00a0performing tricks was more intuitive than remembering an arbitrary button combination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well now you can fight using a sword mapped to the mouse, removing the common video game abstraction of \"press key to perform action\". Not that this means there is any\u00a0realism in our combat system, it's all jank. Use your sword to deflect bullets and slay enemies while traversing the disappointing and only room in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/9946f34ce14a1ae36f1aec75a1b65625.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fontastic64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
