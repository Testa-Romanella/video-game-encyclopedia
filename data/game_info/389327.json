Our game aims to help show people the horrible impact that something as simple as littering can have on our Earth, but also how easy it is to take action.  If things keep going the way they\u2019re going now, our waters will be polluted and the world will suffer.  One person alone can make a small impact but if everyone works together to spend just part of their day helping to pick up the little things, it makes a huge impact for the better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2d65e85ff7bf7442af3e65743729f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Petterr"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
