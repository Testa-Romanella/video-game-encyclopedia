No one can know for sure, but you do know that if you don't do something about it soon then those extraterrestrial varmints will steal your livelihood.</p>\n<p>Make smart decisions using your four abilities: Shoot, Lasso, Call, and Scare. Use these to fight off the aliens and return your cows back to safety!</p>\n<p><strong><strong>___________________________________________</strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>S E T T I N G\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Set in post-capitalist USA within a fictional\u00a0near future, you take control of three rough and tumble cattle ranchers: Miguel, Maeve, and Sunny. Farmers get assigned a plot of land together to better make use of the land, and are provided with a few basic resources that they\u2019ll need to sustain themselves. These three are in it together until the cows come home!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Times have been though lately, and they cannot afford to lose any cows.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Miguel</strong><br/>Beloved twink and coyote hunter of the polycule. He's a crafty guy, but definitely the most sensitive and neurotic of the three. He spends a LOT of time outside at night, and could be mistaken for a cryptid himself.\r\n\n<strong>Maeve</strong><br/>She's the heart of the farm, but don't be fooled by her calm and gentle demeanor. She can take a good hit and dish it back twice as hard. Her mechanical legs are a defining feature for her, making her alien butt-kicking even more efficient. Miguel and Sunny both look to her for leadership.\r\n\n<strong>Sunny</strong><br/>He's the oldest of the three and so tends to take things a lot slower, valuing a cool head in times of trouble. Miguel and Maeve both see him as their rock in the storm, and often turn to him when they need a second opinion and someone willing to give it to them straight.       Sometimes it\u2019s a little less than straight, though.\r\n\n<p><strong>___________________________________________</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>C R E D I T S</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Designer, Sound Designer:</strong> Nico Chera<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer: </strong>Cole G.
