As the Security Guard you are equipped with a flashlight to see and a night stick to destroy the Prototype. Be careful not to destroy too many Prototypes or you will be fired and lose the game. As the Prototype you can freeze and pose in order to try to blend in with the other Prototypes and hide in Plain Sight.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T02:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/066fae2d9db5cd512ec6538756b796f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eliteteams Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eliteteams"], "esrb_rating": null}
