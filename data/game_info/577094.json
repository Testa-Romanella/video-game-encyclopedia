These flavor enhancements affect player flavor balance (circle tiles), competitor flavor balance (square tiles), or give the player currency to buy shop items (triangle tiles).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>When a player has a flavor go\u00a0<strong>above 20</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>below 0</strong>, they have lost flavor balance and are eliminated. The last player standing wins!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The shop is not fully implemented in the prototype.
