For the most part, my time was spent developing the player controller and abilities, including wall jumping, similar to Hollow Knight, a projectile-based attack, a dash, and of course a double jump.<br/></p>\n<p>Later in development, I was tasked with designing and creating the penultimate level in the game. This level introduced new challenges to the player.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A couple of those challenges were locked rooms where the player must defeat all the enemies in the room to unlock the doors. The other was a timed platforming challenge where the player had to trigger a switch to reveal an obstacle course of platforms and enemies. If they didn't reach the end before time ran out the platforms would disappear and the player would have to go through it all over again. I liked to refer to this as running the gauntlet as it was probably the most challenging section of the game.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>This project was developed by ++Void, a team comprised of myself and four of my classmates during the mid-term project period of my degree program at Full Sail University.
