Wander blindly through a small cavern in which your only memory beforehand were flutes....</p>\n<p>This is meant to be a proof of concept played from beginning to end. Closing the game will lose all progress. Also clicking continue too quickly after an interaction can cause the button to freeze, resulting in lost progress. Enjoy the ride!</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Point and click on a body part or an arrow. Clicking a body part first will start an interaction with the second item you click., be it an arrow, another body part.... or possibly some nightcrawler in the room with you. It's up to you to find out what interactions work with most of your senses gone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a22f54c26b82565e1bd672548132e811.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moss Covered Bones"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
