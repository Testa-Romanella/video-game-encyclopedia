They have equipped themselves with a magnetic suit, ready to\u00a0take on the challenges Magnetaria has to offer. By using the two different polarities\u00a0of the magnetic suit, negative and positive, Nova can traverse and overcome the\u00a0challenges ahead of them. Use the forces of the magnetic suit and traverse by\u00a0switching polarity at the right time. If not done correctly, Nova might fall to their\u00a0death.</p>\n<p>Magnetaria is a single player platformer that is all about momentum and flow. Find\u00a0the best way to traverse through the level, and contain the momentum and flow to\u00a0pass through the game with ease. Magnetaria is a game for both casual and\u00a0experienced players. The game can be played at your own pace, or played in a more\u00a0fast paced manner.
