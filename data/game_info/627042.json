You must be dying for action! Like I was saying, the mission is S.Y.A.K.S.S, standing for So You Are a Kangaroo Scientist in Space. Very proud of that acronym, in my opinion my second best, right after the ELT, or Extremely Large Telescope.\r\n\r\nSO, like I was saying, your mission on this mission is to search and collect the listed alien specimens for some sciencing.

So once you start running, you are committed to it for a short amount of time. But on the other hand, your speed also increases after a moment of running, so keeping the speed you\u2019ve built up is beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>W </strong>- look up<br/><strong>A\u00a0\u00a0</strong>- run left<br/><strong>S\u00a0\u00a0</strong>- look down<br/><strong>D </strong>- run right<br/><strong>Space </strong>- jump</p>\n<p><strong>R </strong>- reload level</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Game Jams:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for two\u00a0jams that happened at the same time and it was made during the last week of both of them.
