Shortly there after the little alien found out that the new planet's gravitational pull had been pulling asteroids and other hazardous objects towards its UFO.\u00a0Luckily\u00a0the UFO's cannon was still\u00a0 functional but with only a small amount\u00a0of ammo left how long can the little alien last?\r\n</p>\n<p>This was my first ever game jam as well as my first ever finished game that I had made myself that\u00a0I had decided to post to the world. As the jam began\u00a0just recently was getting into game development and was learning other engines when I found this jam, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Although I had to learn how to use Game Maker Studio 2 I learned a lot and\u00a0had a lot of fun and at times frustration figuring out how things worked, and it was cool seeing ever ones amazing entries. So overall there might be some bugs. This is the final project and updated a bit more than the actual game jolt page.</p>\n<p>Have Fun \r\n</p>\n<p>After seeing that the judges had picked the eight games, I have decided to post my game onto a few different websites just for fun seeing that my journey with this jam has ended. Now that the jam is over for me, I can now say that in the end I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot. I saw a lot of great games throughout the jam and I would just like to say best of luck to all those who placed in the top eight.</p>\n<p>Quick note: I put links to the game jam and the public voting if you want to check them out. I will not be adding more to the game as my html5 license has expired with the jam. That is unless people want to see more.<br/><br/>Cya :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T10:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/2703509d64a74979ec1b734bb17e0618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZaiGith"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
