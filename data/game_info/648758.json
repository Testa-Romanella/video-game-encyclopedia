I uploaded it here because when I upload it to Unity Play it removes some of the elements of the game. It is a work in progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum requirements to run</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A Desktop PC that is either windows or mac.</li><li>A beast level graphics card with beast level ram.</li></ul>\n<p>I am still learning so I have not applied LOD to this game. Everything is in high detail. I suggest running this game only if you are confident in your rig. That is until I learn more and control the graphics better.</p>\n<p>I have had a few friends play this now and they think it is pretty cool. So I thought I would open it up publicly to play for free. If someone can get 5 minutes of enjoyment out of this then I am happy :)</p>\n<p><strong>What's the objective in \"Just LEGGO\"?</strong></p>\n<p>The objective is to just let go and play with LEGO. This game is unfinished and might not get finished as it is purely a learning project that I cant do anything with commercially. You can play it for free though. There are currently 9 levels. Each level has a different objective. Each level has a world score. This took a little time to get my head around and is the thing I am most proud of with the project. The game will keep track of your personal best per level and put you on the world board if you beat the time.</p>\n<p>Can you beat any of the times that are currently set?</p>\n<p>This is best played with a gamepad for gameplay along with a mouse and keyboard for the UI.</p>\n<p>\"Just LEGGO\" and enjoy :)</p>\n\n<p>There is a feedback form along with other Cool Stuff at www.CoolStuffProductions.com\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/033c88b023fcf6b9dc06849d3200d20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CoolStuffProductions"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
