{"id": 402005, "slug": "resist-3", "name": "Resist!", "name_original": "Resist!", "description": "<p>A common experience for queer people is hiding who we are for chunks of our lives. That hiding hurts, it takes its toll on each of us. <strong>Resist!</strong> takes place in a village where everyone is expected to look the same and must shed their identity. You need to free the village. Tear down posters demanding conformity, sabotage the converters that strip people of their identity and watch as the village starts to rise with you!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Resist!</strong>\u00a0is the sixth chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>Resist!</strong> is a brief diversion from that and instead uses the 2019 Rainbow Game Jam prompt of 'community'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e8502d926cad268f8e2446ff19ae69ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
