Early scans of this planet indicated it had a dense jungle environment, the first of its kind discovered outside of Earth. They sent a team of five on an expedition to explore the planet and analyze its ecosystem. When the ship arrived at Volarkis, the four scientists on the team\u00a0took a shuttle down to the planet's surface to perform their research, while you stayed behind on the ship to perform maintenance.</p>\n<p>Now, some time later, you've lost all contact with the team on the ground. You go down to the planet to investigate.\r\n</p>\n<p>Explore the expedition's research site. Listen to the audio logs left behind. Find out what happened to the research team.\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<p>WASD: Move<br/>Hold Right Click: Datapad<br/>Hold Left Click: Scanner<br/>ESC: Pause<br/>E:\u00a0Use Keypad</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>This is a group project for LMC 2730 at Georgia Tech.
