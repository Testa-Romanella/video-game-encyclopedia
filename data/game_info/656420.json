Destroying good objects make you lose catastrophic strength. Bad objects give you catastrophic strength on destroying. Your goal is to make the highest catastrophic strength. Your game is over if your catastrophic strength is 0, or if your butterfly touches the ground. On catastrophic strength 0, your score at the end of a game is the highest catastrophic strength during play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fly, you can choose pickUps. Multiplier pickUp multiplies negative points as well! You can choose clever what pickUps to choose.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7eb8e3f27940a64f297563793a37728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zuag"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
