Distractions, in the shape of hammers, try to destroy these ideas before they leave his brain. The player's mission is to avoid the hammers and get the ideas out.</em></p><p>This was our Global Game Jam 2015 game. We wanted to do a crazy like Japanese looking gaming. You play inside a cubic head and you have to move your ideas (light-bulbs) into a part of your brain... but, beware, there are hammers that move randomly that will try to destroy your ideas! </p><p>Is a prototype.</p><p><strong>How to play</strong></p><p>Move the light-bulb to the end point. Be careful because random appearing hammers can break you!</p><p>You move by clinking the light-bulb, it will show you move range, and you click in the correspondent hexagon. One movement per turn. It is possible to pass one turn clicking in the <strong>pass</strong> button.<br/></p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>We are putting a slightly better version here that the one of the GGJ15. Is equally buggy, <br/></p><strong>Credits</strong><p>Hassan ElKady</p><p>Mohamed Fawzy</p><p>Youngju Kim</p><p>Lutz Kleinau</p><p>Rodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c972b4db522be91f22e072f125569c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["gameornot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
