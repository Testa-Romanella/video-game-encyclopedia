It is a modern try on a point-and-click game where we move the focus from the boring puzzles and pixel hunts to a strong narrative and rich world, with many choices and different approaches. The graphics are a hybrid combination of 2D pixel art and modern 3D to enchant the atmosphere but still keep your imagination active.</p>\n<p>Demo contains the Prologue scene, which showcases some of the gameplay with many different narrative options and outcomes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is still early in development, and we are a small team, with most of the work done by just one guy. So expect bugs, mistakes, etc. That's also one more reason why all comments and support are very welcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you'll enjoy your experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T06:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a6f1b531e60ff8db856402a103801c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bohemian Pulp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
