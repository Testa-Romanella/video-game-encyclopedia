{"id": 660615, "slug": "penny-dragon", "name": "Penny Dragon", "name_original": "Penny Dragon", "description": "<p>A submission to the One-Page RPG Jam 2021.</p>\n<p>This is a GM-less, co-operative game for people of all ages, where you play a group of little dragons trying to assemble a hoard.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are very small dragons facing the perils of the enormous ordinary world as you try to build a hoard of similarly tiny objects, like pennies. The game is written as urban fantasy, but could easily be translated into a high fantasy setting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Penny Dragon</em>, you take it in turns playing Terrible Foes - describing the scene and playing the monsters your dragons are facing in order to increase their hoard. When you're not playing a Terrible Foe, you're playing a little dragon! Every success adds an object to your hoard, which can be a physical hoard that you pool in the centre of your table, or a digital hoard you represent with tokens on a website like Roll20.</p>\n<p>You will need:</p>\n<ul><li>4-8 D4s</li><li>A Hoard of 10-40 objects. We recommend sweets, snacks, or loose change.</li></ul>\n<p>Whilst the game is designed to be family friendly, it's for players of all ages, and we recommend it for adults too! (If you wanted to, for example, your Hoard could become alcoholic shots....Althought we ask that you\u00a0please drink responsibly.)</p>\n<p>Layout and formatting by Max Briar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfd97308121c76b61436489b64abb5df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ella Watts"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
