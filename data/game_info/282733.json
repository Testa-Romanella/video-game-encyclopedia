It is an action game where the goal is to survive for as long as possible. This is simply a prototype game and did not end up as polished as I would have liked...perhaps in the future I will consider continuing development of this game into a proper wave survival game with more features. The game is developed using Unreal Engine 4. Unfortunately, I was unable to build a Mac version of the game. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy this demo game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c0/9c04e08651d566347f6981bda4ba0a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZyronnSorrow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
