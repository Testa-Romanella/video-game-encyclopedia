Play the role of the SUPER AQUA GOTH as you find yourself stranded on a desert planet - in search of water. If you dry out you'll die, and the caves seem the best bet. In them you find strange jugs of water - enough to keep you alive - but also enemies! And the deeper you go, the more of everything! How far can you make it before you perish?</p>\n<p>As a more technical rundown, Cave Girl - SUPER AQUA GOTH is a procedurally generated roguelike action-rpg. There are powerups throughout the caves that all effect each other! The enemies can use the powerups too, as well as some of their own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318b3dab8c32b8e6218c25a111ee378d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nardandas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
