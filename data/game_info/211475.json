Through the simulation of sceneries from fiction and reality, it offers an opportunity to examine the willful re-enactment of history in which we find ourselves. This is history experienced, the first time, as tragedy, and the second time, as farce.</p>\n<p>The five areas within the virtual reality compose an intersected loop. The viewer-player can start from any point in this process and find their way through the entire infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The artist considers this work as a game project. At the same time, he seeks to distinguish the project from the score-keeping mechanism typical of games. Instead of being motivated by an external value, Bunker aspires to intrigue the viewer-player, to elicit their curiosity to explore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e62/e62b973833442bfabcdad663830f39f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yorik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
