Players take on the roles of two people who have and may still care deeply for one another, who describe the other through a memory. They listen, ask questions, and fully flesh out the memory before the listener decides if they believe their companion and integrate the memory, or if they reject it.<br/><br/>These memories are\u00a0 used to come to a decision on who they are as a person.<br/><br/>This game is based upon my experience as a trauma victim whose memory functions poorly and I\u00a0am often told memories about myself I can no longer really remember, or only hold emotional memory of.\u00a0<br/><br/>Content warnings: Memories, memory manipulation (consensual), memory questioning;\u00a0 some questions and expansions of the memory may feel like gaslighting, although not intended as such.\u00a0 If struggling with memory is a trigger for you, please do not proceed with this game.\u00a0Memories themselves are not based on traumatic events and are not about abuse, unless the players wish to engage with that material.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T05:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e676b119fe60cdc32a69bb794dfa76ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kate Bullock"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
