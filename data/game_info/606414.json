You play as an emigrant documenting their\u00a0days aboard a ship headed for\u00a0Mars.</p>\n<p> The driving game mechanic is a procedural narrative, where the story is broken into many\u00a0modules, \u00a0or days,\u00a0which are played one after the other. Modules must meet\u00a0certain conditions in order\u00a0to be playable, and\u00a0modules are\u00a0chosen at random until a playable module is found. This allows for a procedural narrative which can\u00a0tailor itself to player choices and follow loosely-structured arcs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T07:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/574e2c0949b6281936593048ac803843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZhiTonga"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
