Or the time you spend together as a family?</p>\n<p>This is a very short game about bringing \"home\" along with you, even to those who feel far away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because to us, home isn't a place. It's a moment shared among loved ones. A moment filled with music and laughter, framed with photos and flowers, and happiness. Or whatever you want it to be really. What's important is that you surround yourself with the things and people you love. So no matter where you are, home can come to you.</p><p>Team Dashing Uni-Corns :</p>\n<p>Roxanne Chartrand -\u00a02D Artist / Character Artist<br/>Tiffani Trogi -\u00a02D Artist / Environment Artist\u00a0<br/>Marc-Andr\u00e9 De Blois - Game Designer / Sound Designer<br/>F\u00e9lix Liberali - Game Disgner / Integration<br/>Emery Monzerol - Programmer / Music Composer<br/>William Alexandre Thibault - Technical Artist / Integration</p>\n<p>Diversifiers of Global GameJam 2019:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Always Room for One More (Sponsored by Origin Access)<ol><li>Make a game where new players can join at any time</li></ol></li><li>Language-Independence (Sponsored by Valve Software)<ol><li>Create a game that can be understood regardless of which language the player speaks</li></ol></li><li>Keep it simple<ol><li>Make your game playable by people who can use no more than a D-pad plus 2 buttons, with hardware like an Xbox Adaptive Controller in mind.</li></ol></li><li>Scale With A Song<ol><li>Your game must last exactly the length of a single music track.</li></ol></li></ul>\n<p>Video :</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/7489c8a7b432a8eabeb5391df5b65f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thiw01"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
