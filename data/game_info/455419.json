It was a whole thing.</p><p>With less time, I made this simple 2D actiony game. I'm not sure the genre, and I didn't use the full day or so I had available, as my family wanted me so I just worked on it for about 6 hours. About half of that time was spent just making the music, the actual game received very little time.</p><p>I still rather like that game, though for some reason in the most recent build 0.4, the music breaks for me on my newer computer. I've wanted to remake this game for a long time, but haven't gotten around to it properly. I made a small test demo recreation in GameMaker some odd years ago, but it's definitely fallen by the wayside.</p><p>This was made in the Zero engine, a proprietary game engine from DigiPen: Institute of Technology I had the rights for and preferred to make games in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079b07dd253aa32f417e8275713dcf51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
