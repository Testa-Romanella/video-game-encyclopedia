The theme was Binded Together.<br/> The game fits the theme by having towers which bind to other objects in order to shoot. The vast majority of the art was made in the jam however the music was downloaded from Open Game Art</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you are coming from the jam page, please rate the game well! Although I did have a lot of fun making it it also took a lot of effort so i'd be thankful if you could support me like that!\r\n</p>\r\nI recommend downloading the game for the best experience and performance possible", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:46:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63e/63e349d73b9a2a28a47e66f2006bd16b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["irishgreencitrus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
