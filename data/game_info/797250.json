It is not a full game, it is very limited and it has some bugs, that you will find out. Please take a moment and appreciate my work, by donating. Right now I am a game developer and I want to start a one person indie game studio. I am working in unity right now so you can expect new, bug-free (hopefully) games in the near future. Please Like, Share and if you have the possibility Donate to sustain my work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you have a great time, stay safe.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33a8f7754af9cca66bbcd8a5a2b0cd12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sinaistudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
