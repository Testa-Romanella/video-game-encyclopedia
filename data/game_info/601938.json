The game consists of 5 stages, each of which scales in difficulty. It functions similarly to Super Monkey Ball, but has a jump, and is more platforming focused. You can play the game with a keyboard or controller. I recommend downloading the game so that you can save your progress.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e9bb4be773131780173a67dbf4dd416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RohanOpenSource"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
