The first jump with the first click. The character goes up, then starts to fall. Another click to create a platform. The character jumps off from it, going higher. Another click - another platform. With a happy face the character flies past it. Falls down. Game over.<br/>Second try. Getting better. 10% of level 1 done... wait a second, what's this?! Looks like a bat...\u0410\u0430\u0430ahhh! Click, click, click! It grabbed me! Damn! Game over.<br/>*a couple of sleepless nights after* Well, this mini-boss is finally done for. Quietly placing the character closer to a wall, it's safer there. A blue ball is close, no way around that freezing, but no worries. A shop has to soon - got a lot to spend from those two chests. Maybe upgrade the laser... And invest into agility, dodging really seems to help. And after that...* and after that one can only hear indistinct mumbling and frantic mouse clicking*<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>PC (Win/Mac/Linux);</li><li>Mouse (preferably \u2013 a PC one);</li><li>Left mouse button;</li><li>Right mouse button;</li><li>Steel nerves.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>A little about the project future</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Our game is already playable.
