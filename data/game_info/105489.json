It's the year 9001 and synthetic humans have taken control of first-world civilisation. As a new detective on the force you've been tasked with finding the culprit of an android-human homicide case.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, the police force's efforts are often in vain as the law is frequently dictated by a computer algorithm. In a new era where artificial life is now predominant, you must fight against the odds and solve this investigation.</em></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programmer: Melubnio\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art: Stephanie Reimann\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music &amp; sound: Dominique J.
