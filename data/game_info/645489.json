By doing so, <em>Fulir </em>will once again be the peaceful valley that it once was and <strong>Garth </strong>will regain his status in the magicians order.</p>\n<p>As <strong>Garth</strong>, the player will be able to cast simple/weak spells that will only affect Imps/Goblins. The player must choose between fire, water, earth and air spells when attacking their enemies depending on their weakness. After defeating an enemy, <strong>Garth </strong>will collect its soul. After collecting a certain amount of souls from each element, the player will be able to upgrade <strong>Garth\u2019s</strong> spells to be able to defeat tougher enemies such as Gargoyles and Berserkers. After defeating enough enemies, the boss from each area will appear and the player will have to use their best ability to defeat it. The player can use the souls of its enemies to buy buffs. When <strong>Garth </strong>falls to his enemies power, all souls he collected are freed.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Third person, single-player action experience.\r\n</li><li>Explore freely any of the <strong>5 </strong>areas in the game.\r\n</li><li>Defeat each of the elemental bosses in <em>Byburn</em>, <em>Earthshade</em>, <em>Lakehaven </em>and <em>Northfalcon</em>.\r\n</li><li>Regain your magic skills by capturing the souls of your enemies.\r\n</li><li>Buy buffs to increase your chance of survivability\r\n</li><li>Be careful not to lose your progress by falling to your enemies hands.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Download the zip file</li><li>Extract the zip in a folder</li><li>Open Magic Souls.exe</li><li>Enjoy c:</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:06:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/083c9b70191e5b7535873dcc8ff7ddc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blime"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
