As a result of it, his beloved animals decided to protest and cut all contact with the farmer. But our smart farmer has come up with a solution, his trusty corngun, which is a double-barrel shotgun loaded with corn that he uses to deliver corn, in a fast manner, to his hungry animals. Upon being fed, the animals decide to give up on their protest and proceed to take a nap.</p>\n<p>This is my first complete game/project which thought me a lot of new things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0MrVastayan for all the help provided throughout the project's development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2acdbf676f4ef6ff54958ddf0198cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ionutrogojan"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
