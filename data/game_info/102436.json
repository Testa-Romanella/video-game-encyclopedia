(each turtle a different one). <br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each turtle's got a lifebar, but be careful, if you loose one of the four it's game over! So you are forced to use all of them as a good team. (obviously ;)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>GAME CONTENTS<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The game is a platformer, with 5 different zones and a bonus stage, lots of images and dialogues for a unique story created for the game by Simone Granata.<br/>Great musics created by Gianluca Pappalardo on each level for a full new OST in GameBoy style.<br/>I created sprites and background following the TMNT 1990 movie style (my favourite).<br/>Each level will have a Boss to be defeated so, 5 bosses and a final special boss.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can play using keyboard or joypad.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS<br/><br/>JUMP=\u00a0A<br/>ATTACK = S<br/>RUN= -&gt; -&gt; (fast)<br/>CHANGE TURTLE= Space bar<br/>SHURIKEN= up+A<br/>START/SKIP= Space bar<br/>PAUSE= P<br/>EXIT= ESC</p>\n<p>GAMEBOY GREEN FILTER= 2 (ON), 1 (OFF)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c3ebd9ec57d7dc4dae0756bbede3d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oscar Celestini Retrogames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
