It was a two-player, split-screen game, based on MAD Magazine&#39;s long running cartoon strip, Spy vs. Spy, about the slapstick antics of two spies trying to kill each other with improbably complex and elaborate traps and weapons.<br />\nIt was later ported to a much wider range of platforms including the ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Master System, Game Boy, Xbox, Game Boy Color and Nintendo Entertainment System, which was emulated on the Game Boy Advance. A remake with a retro version was also released on iOS in 2012, which was later incompatible with the advent of IOS 11 (and the exclusion of 32-bit apps).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T09:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/760760e667277d55337d74211cd4babb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 23, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy", "Atari ST", "Apple II", "Game Boy Color", "NES", "SEGA Master System", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["First Star Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["KEMCO", "Beyond Software", "Tynesoft", "Robots and Pencils", "Wicked Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
