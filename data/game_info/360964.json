The topic of the jam was \"Only One\".</p>\n<p>The game plays like a 'Choose your Own Adventure'-Book. You take decisions and watch the story unfold. The catch however is, that you get only one playthrough. One story. Your story.</p>\n<p>I would like to encourage players to exchange their stories, because I am really excited to see which paths players choose to take.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong></p>\n<p>This game contains written descriptions of places, events or other things that might be disturbing to some people.
