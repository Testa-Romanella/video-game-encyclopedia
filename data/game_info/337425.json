The main idea is to forbid you to control the car directly but rather allow to define a path putting targets with the LEFT mouse button.<br/>After placing the target you can change the circle radius a little bit - that is useful sometimes. And the car select the nearest one target, than another one and etc. To remove the circle use RIGHT mouse button, to launch the car use SPACE, and that is all. The roads have different properties, some of them slow down the car, another allow to change the direction quickly, and the ice... To start just unpack and run the .exe (bin) file. The game is requred mouse and keyboard.<br/><br/>In total:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>experimental mechanic</li><li>26 campaign levels and 4 extra levels</li><li>12 different types of the roads</li><li>map editor</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:55:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c2460d8bf7888a0c8f5e77dcb8c7ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["the"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
