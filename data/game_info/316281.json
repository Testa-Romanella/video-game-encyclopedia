It is inspired by gameplay and design from the bonus DLC content in Mirror's Edge (EA DICE, 2008) and\u00a0focuses on a pure minimalistic style, which includes using simplistic objects, shapes and colours that all play a central role in navigation and solving tasks.</p>\n<p>The current version of the game was created in roughly 1 month as part of the Game Audio course at the sound design school\u00a0Sonic College\u00a0where I am currently taking my bachelors degree. Therefore the main emphasis was on creating dynamic sound design and learning how to use FMOD\u00a0though I\u00a0had a lot fun of designing the game in Unity and have decided to continue the project in my spare time as my skills evolve within game designing and programming. Currently the plan is to create a game with 20 puzzles ranging from easy to hard with similar aesthetics, more mechanics, obstacles\u00a0and a fun little story.<br/><br/>For best experience use headphones.</p>\n<p>A windows build will be released at a later stage.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>WASD: move<br/>Shift: sprint<br/>Space: jump<br/>Right click: pick up object<br/>ESC: pause menu<br/><br/>orginal icon by:\u00a0Roundicons.\u00a0Edited by me.<br/>font by:\u00a0SpideRaYsfoNts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T03:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fba874c58f75fed200e57b945a81c15a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Husfar"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
