In this game you can get to choose between 2 characters. A blind owner and a guide dog. This blind owner has to get to the goal in a certain amount of time. There is a catch. This dog can get distracted by many things around the city and go out of control, forcing the owner to either call him back, or in worse scenarios, having to go look for him.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e57c9a8a6692385b2db4d16c68bcb9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Partixel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
