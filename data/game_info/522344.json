On one side lies the Everfrees, a scrappy, young group of people fighting for their freedom On the other lies the Omega Legion, an endless army of robots seeking to rule over all. You play as an Everfree soldier that was separated from your platoon. You have to get to them, but they\u2019re trapped inside of a fortress that lies on top of a mountain. As the Legion closes in on you, you feel an incredible sense of rage and determination and sprint at the enemy robots near you, dodging and weaving through their forces to reach your comrades within the fortress. You\u2019re going to save them, you have to. The goal of the game is to reach the top of the mountain and the innermost part of the fortress, avoiding the Omega Legion\u2019s robots along the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab90ee6d316fedf63a397281a25050a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nepp0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
