{"id": 760163, "slug": "the-tribe-game", "name": "The Tribe Game", "name_original": "The Tribe Game", "description": "The Tribe Game is a story-driven roleplaying game where the player creates their own custom character and steps into a unique, atmospheric post-apocalyptic world where hope prevails, inspired by the classic cult-hit TV series, 'The Tribe'. Taking centre stage in the story, the player interacts with a large range of characters and 'tribes', each of whom is seeking to build a new world, and will help shape their lives and destinies. There are many diverse places to explore, quests to be accomplished, professions to level up, items and resources to be found, battles to be won, friendships to be made and adversaries to be challenged... as the player experiences all of the humour and unpredictable drama in the world of The Tribe - and tries to keep their own (and their tribe's) dreams alive.<h3>Key Features</h3><h3>Interact with a large cast of Characters and Tribes!</h3><br/>Fate will make your character cross paths with many other survivors who are struggling to create a new world, including some familiar faces to those who have watched The Tribe TV series.  For those new to The Tribe, your character will quickly discover who are the other protagonists of this world. Some will be friendly, some will be hostile, some in need, while others threaten the future of the already fragile world.<br/><h3>Explore a Post-Apocalyptic World (and be instrumental in creating a better future)</h3><br/>Travel through lots of contrasting, atmospheric locations... From the ghostly deserted Sectors of the city, to the suburbs... beyond the city to the woods and forests, to the beaches and coast... You will also need to go inside abandoned (or inhabited?) shops and buildings, including a large shopping mall...<br/><h3>Choose Your Own Look, Create Your Custom Character</h3><br/>Put yourself in the picture and make your character look like you, or somebody completely different from your imagination, using the customisable character creator.

It is also possible to completely change your look at regular points during the game as the story unfolds.<br/><h3>Profession Skills to Level and Items to be made or found</h3><br/>Level up your profession skills. Grow produce with your Farming skill. Find ingredients for recipes to create food and drink items with your Cooking skill. Use Tinkering to make items or weapons, as well as things you may need to trade over to others, or in order to complete a quest. Go Fishing. With your Tailoring skill, craft new clothing or 'armour' to enhance your character's stats. Forage and Scavenge locations for items or resources you and your tribe might require. And always be on the look out for unexpected danger or encounters.<br/><h3>Quests to Complete</h3><br/>Sometimes you will be given Quests by others. Have you got what it takes to achieve them?
