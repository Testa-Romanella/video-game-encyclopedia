It is a violent 3D war shooter, but it's so colorful that it's hard not to get lost in its mayhem, and the look of a tropical paradise is just too amazing to miss when playing.<br/>\nLike every great video game, FASTA is very well thought out and designed. The PlayStation 3 version has all the features you'd expect: a wide range of weapons, cover areas, cover enemies, a wide variety of vehicles, a good amount of variety and levels of fun.\n\nWhile the PS3 version does, sometimes, have a strange difficulty curve, it's not at all odd. I've never had a problem. The only problem I've had is in other parts of the game. While playing the game, my framerate would occasionally drop out. The reason is a little murky so I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader. Unless you can prove me wrong, you probably cannot tell this from other footage.\n\nOf course, any playing on a PS3 will have some difficulty. When playing online, even though the PS3 version is a best of breed, my game has had great success in the Xbox Live on-air show \"Kevan's Graphy\", and in several editor. When I play it offline on a PS4, while all of my friends are using the PS3 version, I'm still unable to get it up and running.
