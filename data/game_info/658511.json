You begin the game with a rickety rocket and a bit of fuel and try to get as far as you can. Each run, you're rewarded with coins based on how high you flew which you can then use to buy upgrades. Upgrades include more health, fuel, speed, and upgrades to the rate at which coins are awarded. However, there are also upgrades that let you collect resources from enemies, turning some of the obstacles on your journey into collectibles if you have room for them on your ship.
