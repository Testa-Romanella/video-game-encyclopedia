Save the galaxy and become a hero!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game also has no end so you can continue playing for as long as you want!</p>\n<p>The game is supposed to feel like it can run on old consoles like the PS1 or the Sega Saturn and give a sort of '90s or '80s vibe of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Well, I hope you will enjoy this game :)</p>\n<p>But wait!
