Your objective is use\u00a0tunnels to go\u00a0downwards through the\u00a0sphere to reach a valuable artefact, a crystal (it's about 6 levels down). Pick it up, then use the tunnels back up\u00a0to the surface and escape in your ship to win.<br/></p><p>It'll be challenging to stay alive, each level has new threats. You have bought a rifle with limited ammunition, but you'll need to pick up more ammo and weapons along the way from\u00a0supply crates you'll find.</p><p><strong>Keys:</strong></p><p>Movement: To move use numpad keys, or VIM keys, or WSAD\u00a0(+QEZC for diagonals). You need to be able to\u00a0move diagonally.</p><p>Moving into an enemy creature will cause you to punch it. Moving into an item will pick it up. Moving into a crate will open it.</p><p>To skip a turn while not moving,\u00a0sometimes useful to let enemies come to you, press period/fullstop, or numpad5</p><p>Press keys 1-9 to switch the held weapon/item.\u00a0</p><p>To drop the selected item press\u00a0slash (/) or press T (you have enough item slots that you'll never need to drop items really)</p><p>To use the held\u00a0weapon or item, press F\u00a0to enter\u00a0fire mode. A\u00a0crosshair will appear. To save time it\u00a0will auto-lock onto nearby enemies if there are any in view. You can press tab to cycle through enemies (shift-tab to cycle backwards). You can also use the\u00a0movement keys while in targeting mode to manually move the crosshair. While in targeting mode press\u00a0F to fire the weapon/item at whatever is under the crosshair.</p><p>This also works for items.\u00a0For example with the medkit selected you would fire at yourself to heal. For smoke grenades you'd fire at whatever tile you want to throw one at.</p><p>While in targeting mode you can also press X, for eXamine, which will output a description of whatever is under the crosshair, which can be marginally useful if you spot something new.</p><p>Tunnel tiles have small green arrows on them, pointing either up\u00a0or down.\u00a0To climb down a down tunnel to the next level below\u00a0you must stand on that tile then press &gt; or space.\u00a0To climb up an up tunnel you must be standing on it and then\u00a0press &lt; or space. There is a down tunnel on every level (apart from the last one), and an up tunnel on every level (apart from the first)</p><p>If you do get the crystal and make it back to the surface, walk into your ship to end the game.</p>\n<p>Possibly useful hint/advice: there's an item in the game, that you may or may not find that is very powerful but also very dangerous and can cause you to lose. Only mentioning this because I don't think I\u00a0put enough hints/warning about it in the game.<br/></p>\n<p>On the first level especially there might be\u00a0a lot of key mashing required due to how far you have to walk to reach the tunnel.\u00a0I\u00a0didn't get around to allowing the movement keys to be\u00a0held down.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c0bea4a95587953819a8f659af59447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["user0009182"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
