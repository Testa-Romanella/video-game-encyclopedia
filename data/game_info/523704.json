Your company wants to switch into sustainable packaging, and your Lead Graphic Designer gives you one month to convince an expert to join in with you during a collaboration project. Who would you choose?\u00a0Can you convince them?</p>\n\n<p>As a collaboration between graphic design and video game narrative, our project has two main purposes. On one hand, this project strives to explore the different ways that eco-packaging in graphic design can be explored and integrated into practical projects, not only between graphic designers but also on an interdisciplinary level. On the other hand, this project aims to question how storytelling in video games can be effectively conveyed without simulating the physical environment, using the aforementioned research results as material to build an entertaining and convincing narrative experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Character art:</strong></p>\n<p>Placeholder arts are taken from A Volatile\u00a0Graduation.</p>\n<p><strong>Icons:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Icons made by\u00a0Freepik\u00a0from\u00a0www.flaticon.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Research Survey:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PzlApCP5121rlq0IuT125XDBjEJKF3TeZZ9MUGzQuqA/edit#question=1367005706&amp;field=1196519179</p>\n<p><strong>Workshops:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Sustainability and Energy I:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eduardo Malorni Survey answer: \u00a0 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PzlApCP5121rlq0IuT125XDBjEJKF3TeZZ9MUGzQuqA/edit</p>\n<p>http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/engineering/sustainable-engineering/#:~:text=Sustainable%20engineering%20is%20the%20process,the%20materials%20for%20future%20generations.&amp;text=All%20engineering%20fields%20should%20incorporate,quality%20of%20life%20for%20all.</p>\n<p>https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/designing-sustainability-engineering/</p>\n<p>Sustainability and Energy 2:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652610000363</p>\n<p>Sustainable but Creative I:</p>\n<p>https://www.iberdrola.com/culture/recycled-art</p>\n<p>https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2015/12/pots-of-paint-sustainable-packaging.html</p>\n<p>https://books.google.ca/books/about/Design_to_Renourish.html?id=4b72DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</p>\n<p><strong>S-TAGRAM Artworks:</strong></p>\n<p>Edda Posts:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artwork by Amelia Roblin : https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/accordion-eco-packaging</p>\n<p>Artwork by Vivian Lau: https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/va-valicsek-egg-carton</p>\n<p>Emer Posts:</p>\n<p>Artwork by Matthew Blick: https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2015/12/pots-of-paint-sustainable-packaging.html</p>\n\n<p><strong>Research Survey:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PzlApCP5121rlq0IuT125XDBjEJKF3TeZZ9MUGzQuqA/edit#question=1367005706&amp;field=1196519179</p>\n<p><strong>Workshops:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Sustainability and Energy I:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eduardo Malorni Survey answer: \u00a0 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PzlApCP5121rlq0IuT125XDBjEJKF3TeZZ9MUGzQuqA/edit</p>\n<p>http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/engineering/sustainable-engineering/#:~:text=Sustainable%20engineering%20is%20the%20process,the%20materials%20for%20future%20generations.&amp;text=All%20engineering%20fields%20should%20incorporate,quality%20of%20life%20for%20all.</p>\n<p>https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/designing-sustainability-engineering/</p>\n<p>Sustainability and Energy 2:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652610000363</p>\n<p>Sustainable but Creative I:</p>\n<p>https://www.iberdrola.com/culture/recycled-art</p>\n<p>https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2015/12/pots-of-paint-sustainable-packaging.html</p>\n<p>https://books.google.ca/books/about/Design_to_Renourish.html?id=4b72DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</p>\n<p><strong>S-TAGRAM Artworks:</strong></p>\n<p>Edda Posts:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artwork by Amelia Roblin : https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/accordion-eco-packaging</p>\n<p>Artwork by Vivian Lau: https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/va-valicsek-egg-carton</p>\n<p>Emer Posts:</p>\n<p>Artwork by Matthew Blick: https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2015/12/pots-of-paint-sustainable-packaging.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/621dfeb251d752dc51a43836b17f7610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["holykohlrabi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
