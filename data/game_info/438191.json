The theme was \"conspiracy theory\". Unsurprisingly, I\u00a0yet again bit more than I\u00a0could chew with my management game, which uses D&amp;D type dice throws in the background when determining if a peep is convinced by your hoax. Of course, I've never played D&amp;D, so the battle formulas are terribly unsophisticated and the balance is all over the place.</p>\n<p>Most of the game is just playing around with the UI elements, so that took the biggest part of the workload. The game would definitely need more clearly defined turns between the player and the peeps. All kinds of audio and visual\u00a0feedback for the user actions was planned, but there was not enough time. So, there's none of that!</p>\n<p>Still, the game works and was finished on time, so I'm very happy about that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1d/b1dadc67d8ec18793f6c82dd89bfd803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Armi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
