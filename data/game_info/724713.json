{"id": 724713, "slug": "a-slightly-bigger-step", "name": "A Slightly Bigger Step", "name_original": "A Slightly Bigger Step", "description": "<p>A Slightly Bigger Step is a puzzle/adventure style game where you must traverse the interior and exterior of your ship using physics-based robotic arms, whilst completing puzzles such as reconnecting wires. In the depth of space, zero gravity will impede your movement and you must use the robotic arms provided to scale the ship exterior and complete your tasks. You have 10 minutes to activate the satellite before the game ends.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second-year university brief at the University of South Wales, in association with Tiny Rebel Games. The module brief was \"The 2020 Which Wasn't\". Teams had to make games that were 8 to 10 minutes long, with a novel interaction system, about an event that might have happened in 2020 but didn't.</p>\n<p><strong>Development Team\u00a0</strong> \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Design:\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Usman Tarafdar - Technical Lead, Programmer, Mechanic Designer + Creator, Rigger, Puzzle Designer &amp;\u00a0Playtester</li><li>Jaz Banson - Level Designer, Wire Mechanic Designer,\u00a0Puzzle\u00a0Designer &amp; Playtester\u00a0</li><li>Thomas Nicholls - Concept Game + Story Design Planner &amp; Playtester</li><li>Kothil Mozhiyan - Level Designer, Sound Designer,\u00a0Cinematic Creator, Puzzle Designer\u00a0&amp; Playtester\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Ellie Marden - UI Designer, Puzzle Designer, VFX Designer &amp;\u00a0Playtester</li></ul>\n<p>Artist Team:\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Max Dunsmore -\u00a02D Environment Concept Art &amp; Graphics</li><li>Sydnie-Anna Brant -\u00a0Character Concept Art, Modeling, Texturing &amp; Props</li><li>Jolyon Dixon -\u00a03D Environment Art : Ship interior, Robotic Arms Modeling &amp; Texturing</li><li>Nick Amalin -\u00a03D Environment Art: Intractable Props Modeling &amp; Texturing</li><li>Harri Jones -\u00a03D Environment Art : Ship Exterior &amp; Props Modeling &amp; Texturing\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>With special thanks to Susan Cummings &amp; Lee Cummings at Tiny Rebel Games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find out more about the University of South Wales Games' courses at https://www.southwales.ac.uk/games/ and http://www.twitter.com/uswgames\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee35f6aa9f5ff8c7e95ea3da35815ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["USW Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
