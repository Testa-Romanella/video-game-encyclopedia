I had RPGMaker XV Ace sitting on my computer for some time after grabbing it and a ton of DLC from a HumbleBundle but never committed to doing anything with it, so I used this project to learn the very basics. I was limited on time, so what I have is <em>extra</em> Baby's First RPGMaker game (including having a much larger file than necessary for a four room prototype, as well as a particularly erratic monster oops) but I'm uploading this as proof that gosh darnit <em>I made a thing and learned something</em>.</p><p>Anyway, your name is Karen. You're on a (small) spaceship with two monsters and a Kyle. One of those things will (try to) kill you.</p><p>Assets used were bought through the HumbleBundle and are available on Steam:</p><ul><li>Futuristic Tiles by Degica.</li><li>Futuristic Atmospheres by Joel Steudler.</li></ul><p><strong>Game is currently not running for all users. I'll be attempting to fix those problems, but also this was literally a first attempt by a first-timer so I make no promises.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["glorious"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
