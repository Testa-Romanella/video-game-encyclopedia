The game plays like the old Vectrex version of Scramble (the best!), but looks like an Atari 2600 game.</p><p>Also, the landscape is constructed randomly each time you play. It's not amazingly random, but enough to spice things up :)</p><p>The objective of the game is to reach and destroy the enemy base at the end of the city maze.</p><p>You earn points simply by staying alive and you recieve an extra life at 10.000 points.</p><p>Shoot the green fuel pods for additional fuel; your spaceship will crash when you run out of fuel.</p><p>Shoot enemy ships when in flight for additional points.</p><p>The game will restart, but at a higher difficulty, after destroying the enemy base.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/9440cfcd1791cbdb3a777991fe6caef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wiebow"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
