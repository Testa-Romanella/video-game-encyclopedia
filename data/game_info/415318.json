Featuring a world and story that is inspired by the works of Monty Python, it also has aesthetics and game feel that is inspired by children\u2019s theatre and a feeling of childlike wonder.</p>\n<p>Time for Dinner features the player as the star of the show, as a boy on a quest to save his mother from an early death; because if she dies, there\u2019s nobody to cook. And with the kingdom\u2019s Holy Grail, she could be immortal! Living forever means cooking forever, right?</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s aesthetics are also inspired from a variety of references - ranging from the recent remake of Wonder Boy, Costume Quest, and Peanuts comics. Combining these with the cutting wit of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Team MewTwo has surely created a standout.</p>\n\n\n<p>#################################################</p>\n<p><strong>Creator Notes</strong></p>\n<p>With hard work and great teamwork, we successfully completed the development of this game on time.<br/><br/>Team : Team MewTwo (1 Designer, 2 Artists &amp; 1 Programmer)<br/>Role : Lead Programmer &amp; Gameplay Programmer (Stevannus)<br/>Engine : Unity<br/>Module : Game Project Studio 1<br/>Duration : 12 Weeks (Sep 2018 - Dec 2018)<br/></p>\n<p>Credits - Team MewTwo\u00a0: Sophie\u00a0Azlan, Sim Chew, Arjun Ajay Pillai, Stevannus\u00a0Lake\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c90991918d3958c13d940460f2fca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stevannus Lake"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
