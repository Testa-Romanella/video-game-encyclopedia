Move your mouse around to see if you can discover\u00a0what kind of creature dwells in this negative space.<br/><br/>\"Bileview\"\u00a0is a small experiment created in a day. I thought it would be interesting to create an exploration game that required exploration of your actual computer screen, with the game\u00a0window acting as\u00a0a viewport. The game window was designed to be so small because\u00a0the idea of not being able to get the full picture at once, having to piece together what something looks like bit-by-bit appealed to me.</p>\n<p>The game (<em>should</em>) adjust its size based on your screen resolution, meaning it will take longer to find the creature on your impressive 4k monitor.</p>\n<p>Lowering the volume on your computer to around 50% may be a good idea, as a sudden blast of audio can be a bit jarring. Unless you're into that, of course.</p>\n<p>Currently Windows-only, unsure if a Mac build would be completely broken.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-02T17:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a21/a21042e861ea9f9e78f046e592942be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scroungin' 4 Catsup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
