Ever notice how the silhouette of an object changes when you turn it around? Notice how it changes again when you get closer or farther away? Well, what if this distortion worked differently than in our real world?<br/><br/>In Leaving Said Dimension, you are searching for a specific silhouette - you are looking for a shape that is not really there. The same 3D space looks very different depending on your perspective, and exploring this distortion is the core of the game. You only know the outline of the key you are looking for - the rest is up to you.</p><p>As a player, you switch between perspective, orthographic and oblique view, dramatically affecting the silhouettes of the 3D objects. You can even freeze an object, so it stays in perspective mode, while everything else changes. If you want to have your ideas of spatial reality shaken, this is the game for you!</p><strong>Made by:</strong><p>Benno L\u00fcders<br/>Morten Nobel-J\u00f8rgensen<br/>Amanda Rasmussen<br/>Mikkel Schl\u00e4ger<br/></p><p>Slides explaining the game design.<br/></p><br/><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b81b47fb1108b1b51814857dd8070090.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["amnaradesign"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
