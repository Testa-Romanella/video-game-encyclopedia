Actually, I was going to implement a command system, and an idea that gives mechs value of remaining bullet and also prepares a facility that allows them to supply ammo, but\u00a0I couldn't do that because I hadn't enough time...<br/></p>\n<p>It is still under development and has many bugs. Moreover, there are not enough explanations and tutorials to tell you about the game system... but I think it is at least playable.\u00a0I hope you enjoy playing it!</p>\n<p>I've never made an English game, and this is the first game to submit a foreign game jam, so I think there may be containing some mistakes in grammar and word choice, but please go easy on me!</p>\n<p>*Caution!
