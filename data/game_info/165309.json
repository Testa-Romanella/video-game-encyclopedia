One player may use keyboard/mouse if you only have one controller.</p><p> Loosely based on the Combat atari 2600 game, four tanks battle for supremacy. There is a major issue, you have but one bouncy missile to launch. You must hit the enemy, or go retrieve your shell in order to shoot again. Boards have hazards, bounce walls, portals, power-ups, and more to shake things up.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/375/37547f35850e84978c8544ccd9b9fd62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Hypermonkey Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
