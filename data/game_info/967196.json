{"id": 967196, "slug": "your-train-2", "name": "Your Train 2", "name_original": "Your Train 2", "description": "\"Your Train 2\" is a very simple brain game! Customers who love trains, customers who love games, everyone can enjoy it. No expertise required.<br/>\r\nWe have prepared a total of more than 50 railway lines in Japan and Taiwan!<br/>\r\n(You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the previous work, \"Tokyo Densha\" and \"Your Train\".)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbTo everyone who will be a train dispatcher<br/>\r\nDear train dispatchers, let's transport customers by starting various trains, such as local trains and limited express trains.<br/>\r\nIn the previous work, commuter routes in urban areas were the main ones, but in this work, we have prepared many railway routes throughout Japan and Taiwan. In addition, some of the commuter routes that appeared in the previous work have been completely remade and reappeared. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Goal of the game<br/>\r\nLet's aim for high operating profits by receiving fares from customers waiting at the station!<br/>\r\nThe fare in this game is a bit different from both reality and its predecessor. The fares you charge will decrease over time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nincome<br/>\r\nFixed fare - waiting time before boarding - boarding time to the right end of the screen = fare income<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustomers at any station will receive a fixed fare, but the fare will be less due to the time it takes for the train to arrive at the station and the time it takes for the train to run to the right end of the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\ncost<br/>\r\nTo depart a train, a \"departure fee\" will be charged according to the number of vehicles.<br/>\r\nExample: 30 for a 2-car train, 35 for a 3-car train, 40 for a 4-car train<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOperating profit is the difference between fare revenue and departure cost.<br/>\r\nLet's quickly provide trains to customers who are waiting at the station and quickly carry them to the right edge of the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn particular, the game features a large number of express trains and bullet trains. In addition to the fare for these trains, customers can also receive a \"express fee\". In pursuing operating profit, the method of operating the limited express is very important. Please play a lot and grab the tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbMethod of operation<br/>\r\nOperation is very easy.<br/>\r\nAll you have to do is decide the number of train cars to depart and let the train depart at the best timing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbVolume is plentiful<br/>\r\nWe have over 50 train lines for you!<br/>\r\nIn addition, rules that were not in the previous game will appear in the middle of the game, so please enjoy them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbRailway to play<br/>\r\nJR Hokkaido, JR East, JR Tokai, JR West, JR Shikoku, JR Kyushu<br/>\r\nTobu, Seibu, Keikyu, Keio, Kintetsu, Meitetsu, Odakyu, Nankai, Keisei, Taiwan Railway, Taiwan High Speed Rail<br/>\r\nHokuso Railway Izukyu<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbNew features in this game<br/>\r\nIn the Information Center, we have added a \"Layout\" function that allows you to change the layout of the buttons according to how you hold your smartphone. You can choose from three types: right-handed, left-handed, and how to hold the game console.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbChanges from the previous game<br/>\r\nIn the previous game, the timing to receive the fare was the moment the customer boarded the car, but in this game, it is when the customer is brought to the right edge of the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the previous work, the departure cost for limited express trains and bullet trains was slightly higher, but in this work, all trains are the same.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"The effect of some buttons has been changed.\" Also new rules are coming. Instructions are provided in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbCapacity is about 130MB<br/>\r\nThe storage burden is also small. There is no heavy processing at all, so there is no problem with relatively old models.<br/>\r\nOne game takes less than 3 minutes, so you can enjoy it easily.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- No ads, no in-app purchases<br/>\r\nNo in-app purchases. No ads.<br/>\r\nThere is nothing to disturb the operation of the train. Please concentrate on the game.<br/>\r\nYou can also choose the difficulty level from \"Difficult/Normal/Easy\".
