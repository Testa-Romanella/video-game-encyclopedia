Today's experiment involves data collection and analysis of how the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 compound next to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 changes the perception of light in a controlled environment. We will use prisoners sentenced to death in the test against our test subjects (reread incident report \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 // - \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 * -\u2588\u2588).
