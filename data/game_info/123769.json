No job is too hard or too dangerous in your eyes... as long as the credits are good. And if the client pays, you will package up the materials and hand deliver their items personally. How many days can you survive in this dangerous business?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Smuggler\u00a0</strong></em>is broken down into two game phases. The first phase consists of you producing the correct materials for your clients. The second phase deals with you transporting the materials through asteroid fields, maybe even pirate infested areas. If you are successful in transporting the materials, you will get paid and will be able to upgrade your ship or repair your production machines.</p>\n<p>HTML 5:\u00a0https://www.kongregate.com/games/DaBigMan76/smuggler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7e/b7e64454f7cafd80f338b93501f16f1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seth Konoza"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
