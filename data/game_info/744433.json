It sends the target to a random dimension. Sometimes tha target is you! You can kill the coming monsters by sending them to dimension where lava and spikes are. Luckily, the portal color in the corner is a color of the dimension you'll send monster to. WASD to move, Left mouse button to shoot. And it's your luck if monster spawns already on spikes. Grab it all, you'll need it &gt;:))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:01:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/216ae3b225246dcb6ed9ac72209f6d42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["azazel_261"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
