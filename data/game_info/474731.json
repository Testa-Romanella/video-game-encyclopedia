Well, it's time to shoot for the stars!</p>\n<p>Fed up with how crummy this year has been going (so far), you set off to build and climb a tower that will reach the moon in order to escape it. But unspeakable horrors throughout the miserable year have turned your ambitious project into a race against the clock. It's up to you to finish your tower to the big white disc in the sky, before the year finishes you off once and for all!<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><br/>A &amp; D Keys - Walk left and right<br/><br/>W Key - Place block above you<br/><br/>Space - Jump<br/><br/><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Press jump while leaning against a wall to initiate a wall slide.
