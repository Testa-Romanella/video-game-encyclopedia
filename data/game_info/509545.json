In your machine there are different spells with which you can destroy the never ending armies of light.</p>\n<p>Controlls</p>\n<p>The machine of your ritual has different states where the currently active one is outlined in red. Sacrifice the appropriate ingredient to move from one state to another, with the required ingredients on the arrows of the machine.</p>\n<p>If you are in a state with a spell you want to use, then press the spacebar and execute it, but be careful, if you are in an empty state you will injure yourself.</p>\n<p>Defeat the nasty angels with fireballs, the mean peace dove with the lightning and the red shirt humans with the poison ball.</p>\n<p>Against the especially dangerous rocks you have to summon a shield to defend yourself. But don't summon two because even that hurts yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34b4e1a466b8997f2974d30cfccbd9e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Stames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
