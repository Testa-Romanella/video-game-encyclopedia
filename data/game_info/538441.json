{"id": 538441, "slug": "nurse-demon", "name": "Nurse Demon", "name_original": "Nurse Demon", "description": "Summary\r\n<p>A game made for the Completion Jam, where the theme was \"Out of Place\".</p>\n<p>When Af loses a bet with a fellow demon, she must endure a shift volunteering at a children's health clinic as punishment. She's out of place trying to help take care of the kids while the doctor performs the checkups, but a bet is a bet and a demon stays true to her word.</p>\n<p>Move with <strong>WASD</strong> and pick up objects with the <strong>Spacebar</strong>. The children in the check up rooms will need various things while they wait, indicated by a thought bubble above their heads. If you pick up the wrong object, you can get rid of it by tossing it into the <strong>Portal to Hell</strong> by the <strong>Toy Chest</strong>.</p>\n<p>Though the Completion Jam is about trying to complete a game project, the usual difficulties of a jam occurred. The game features opening and closing dialogue and a functional level. We hoped to accomplish additional levels and further dialogue scenes. Expected playtime ~5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!<br/><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Diane Sparks<ul><li>Gameplay Programmer, 3D Modeller, Animator</li></ul></li><li>Molina Mey<ul><li>Programmer, Producer</li></ul></li><li>Rami Shreim<ul><li>3D Modeller, Textures, 2D Artist</li></ul></li><li>Riley Park<ul><li>Writer, Particle Effects</li></ul></li><li>Victor Zhou<ul><li>Level Designer, Gameplay Programmer</li></ul></li><li>Wayne Zhu<ul><li>UI Programmer, UI Artist</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Music by Eric Matyas - www.soundimage.org</li></ul>\n<p>Characters belong to Diane Sparks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e2c20b96a0abf10cf6cec736fa165ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Riley", "OrangeChicken", "Victor Zhou", "Friendly Fire", "Molina Mey", "Diane Sparks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
