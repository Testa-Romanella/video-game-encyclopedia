As the theme is out of control, you play with a character that is out of control, it is always moving in the direction it is facing. Your job is to guide the character to coins, avoid mines and avoid getting out of the grid by placing Directing blocks that rotate the character, thus changing his movement direction. Just take care to memorize the letters on your keyboard. <br/></p><p>Credits:</p><p>Music:<br/>Xeon theme remastered by bart: https://opengameart.org/content/xeon-theme-remastered<br/>Coin sounds:https://opengameart.org/content/10-8bit-coin-sounds<br/>Explosion sounds: https://opengameart.org/content/boom-pack-1</p>\n<p>Art:<br/>Keyboard pixel art by Gerald: https://gerald-burke.itch.io/geralds-keys<br/>Coins, Player from Mini FX, Items &amp; UI pack: https://grafxkid.itch.io/mini-fx-items-ui</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3575292c070c94a6661f21108598ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omar Hadhoud"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
