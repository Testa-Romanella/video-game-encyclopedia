The temprature theme is hinted at only through the minimal (read no) interface, just color coding cool/warm. I\u00a0probably did 20% of what I wanted to do, but hey, I actually finished a project!</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's not much but I hope you enjoy it, I\u00a0enjoyed making and (actually) playing it which is not what I expected. I hope you're gonna have (unexpected) fun with it too!</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Survive by jumping on the other characters using your mouse by clicking on the available pattern! It should be very intuitive. Enjoy!</p><p>If playing in the browser be sure to click the full screen button first as the game gets cropped otherwise!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c36/c36a57e2f07f73190fe5e0ad817b99da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Diego Pontes", "razcore"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
