In this game demo you must figure out how things work. Its kind of\u00a0 like puzzles in a demo horror game. This project is a\u00a0<strong>prototype </strong>which is why it is marked as a demo. I'm also not ready to release the full game. I AM taking suggestions for the full game so if you add me on discord, (my username is Vortex#2563 btw) You\u00a0 can suggest ideas or you can commission, you can also just talk to me. I know not a lot of people play my games but if you're reading this, you're a legend. Bye Clark...</p>\n<p>If there are any problems with the ending, restart the game and it should be good but it usually doesn't do anything wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A: Left Of The Room</p>\n<p>S: Middle Of The Room</p>\n<p>D: Right Of The Room</p>\n<p>PLEASE Post Lore!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f831c890496ee0b0aaeb5980c4e98d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RRT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
