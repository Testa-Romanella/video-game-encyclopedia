The main character of the game is a little tomcat named Tommy - he is very curious and so he wants to be the first one who leaves his home world, the Dream Islands. </p><p>To make this plan come true, he signs on at a wizard. </p><p>One day, the wizard is out for some time, Tommy uses the opportunity: He takes the magic book and the crystal sphere and with the right spell, he catapults himself through time and space. Everything goes well it seems and he finds himself in the so called \"Outside World\". </p><p>Fascinating - but soon Tommy wants to return home and realizes that this is impossible! He needs the crystal sphere for that, and some magic potions... </p><p>Unfortunately, the sphere broke down into thousand little pieces, and the potions are guarded by some monsters... And so, Tommy's first adventure begins, and you can experience it with him. Meanwhile, the successor is available, too: It's Magic 2.<br/> <br/> It's Magic consists of three worlds, each one is divided into 8 sections.</p><p> In each world a new graphic set expects you. To leave a section, you have to collect all diamonds and find a magic potion. This potion is carried around by one of the little monsters which run and fly around everywhere. And when you reach the level's end and cannot leave - no problem: It's Magic scrolls to the left and the right, so you can run back any time. </p><p>This is also useful in other cases: For example you can run after a monster until you get it. To do away with these creatures, you got an - of course magical - shot. Depending on the kind of the beastie more or less hits are sufficient to let it blow up in pink dust.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1c5886e4145735b3681acdbef2384fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Protovision"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
