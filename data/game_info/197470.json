It is an asteroids-based clone that uses \u201csound waves\u201d to attack the enemies and stay alive until your health points reach zero. The idea for the project was derived from someone playing with an oscilloscope, and displaying 3D images on it via oscilloscope \u201cmusic\u201d. The initial goal of the project was to make the aesthetics as close to how an oscilloscope looks like in real life. The final goal and the scope of the project is to embellish the game\u2019s already existing systems, add user interface elements to the game, make a game menu, add more levels, add a \u201cboss battle\u201d stage, with an overarching goal of improving the \u201cgame feel\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f9aa0438345be6919144e05a7631b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["klecoz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
