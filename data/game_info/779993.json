The goal of the game is to get the car (the one with a design) out of the parking lot.\u00a0As of right now, it only has the first ten levels of the real game, but if I see that the people like it, I will make all levels. Oh yeah... I should also mention that only the player car has a design... the other cars are just blocks. I'm probably going to change that as well if I see that the people like it. Oh and please report bugs if you find them and I'd like some feedback and ideas. Since the ten levels in the game are the first ten levels don't expect too much of a challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T08:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c294fe63460ab77d75e38f1816a6bd91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HydraDoggo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
