He sells you things to help you on your quest but do you really care about the quest? You struggle with the urge to use the shop keeper's goods against him. All it takes is a little coin.</p>\n<p>Upgrades you buy from the shop can make it easier to collect more coins while in the overworld area.</p>\r\nInspiration (Extended About)\r\n<p>In RE4 you could kill this shop keeper and not be able to buy anything from him in that area anymore. Yet, he somehow shows up later in the game, eager to sell you his wares again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I thought about how funny it would be if this shop keeper, when he showed up again after being killed by the player, would take increasingly ridiculous precautions to protect himself. The real question would be if he could resist the coin if it were offered up to purchase whatever protection he has, thus making him vulnerable again. How long could this possibly go on for?</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<p>Move Character: WASD<br/>Jump: Spacebar<br/>Shop Actions: 1234<br/>Shoot Pistol:\u00a0J</p>\r\nXBOX Controls\r\n<p>Move Character: Left Stick\u00a0<br/>Jump:\u00a0A\r\n<br/>Shop Actions: AXYB\u00a0<br/>Shoot Pistol: RB</p>\n\r\nPlaystation Controls\r\n<p>Move Character: Left Stick\u00a0<br/>Jump:\u00a0Cross<br/>Shop Actions: Cross, Square,\u00a0Triangle, Circle<br/>Shoot Pistol: R1</p>\n<p>*\u00a0Many of these and additional controls are displayed within the game as well.<br/>** You may come across some bugs, shouldn't be anything game-breaking though :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a41a9845263bb646b8112850cadd488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kevin Whitmore"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
