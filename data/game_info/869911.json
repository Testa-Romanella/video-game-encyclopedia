There are still some elements that i like, so i thought i'd upload it anyway! Since i did not have time for a tutorial:<br/><br/><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>- Move with W/A/S/D<br/></p>\n<p>- Shoot with left mouse button. You can only carry two bullets at a time, collect a pickup, dropped by an enemy to replenish your ammunition!</p>\n<p>- Melee Attack with right mouse button</p>\n<p>- Lanters slow you when you get close to them. Shoot them to extinguish them!<br/><br/>Your goal is to stop the rival rituals cult. Sadly there is no ending screen, so now, that you have reached the end when you destroyed the ritual circle!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T06:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfc0f27b34b74fe36c5e032b907eff43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RiptideOtter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
