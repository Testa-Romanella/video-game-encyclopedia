Build a tower using Jenga-bricks and try to place them as accurately as possible! The games difficulty is balenced to provide a small challenge for a more relaxed playthrough rather then to really test the skills of the player. The beautiful Japanese-Styled LoFi-Soundtrack has been thoughtfully created by Haave. Thanks for shifting the game to a new level! ;) Don't forget to check him out on Spotify!<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy everybody!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T08:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916c7f90a31f5c7ef3a2e9764b3a123b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rouvens Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
