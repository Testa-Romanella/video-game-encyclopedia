I made a ball that would go down some ramps, hit some dominos, then launch a ball. I played around with the physics of the engine and learned how to combine two meshes into one. I also added a random texture I had on my computer and applied it to some objects I had. The machine goes like this, the ball goes down 2 sets of ramps, then runs into a set of dominos. The dominos ram into each other, until it hits this very big final domino. This big domino falls until it hits this ramp with a ball, where it send the ball flying. I found it interesting that the mass of the object affected the effectiveness of the collisions, aka how far i could launch the ball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448804dfe1af3ed02a9e16e122137aa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["NiravGolyalla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
