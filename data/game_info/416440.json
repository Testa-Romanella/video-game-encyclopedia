Your plane is on the brink of falling apart, fires are breaking out, and mountain tops are popping up right in front of you! </p>\r\nRepair or steer? Why not both?\r\n\r\n<p>You and a friend will be dashing around on the wings trying to fix the damages. But careful: Like a seesaw, the further you go down a side, the more the plane will tilt. Use this to steer around obstacles!\r\n</p>\r\nTake aim!\r\n\r\n<p>With almost no materials to repair on board, you'll have to shoot down floating material crates with your cannon! Mind, that every time the plane tilts, the cannon will start sliding with it...\r\n</p>\n<p>Start the engines, repair damages, collect materials and try not to crash in this charismatic 2.5D steampunk chaos! Good Luck!</p>\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This game is co-op only; so you will need at least one controller!\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nAction\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>Keyboard\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>Controller\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>Move<br/>WASDLeft Stick<br/>Interact (Repair / Shoot)<br/>SpaceB (right button)<br/>DashLeft Shift<br/>Right Trigger<br/>\n\r\nCredits\r\nThis game was developed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2020 for the theme \"repair\".
