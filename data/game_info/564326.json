I chose to stick with 3 significant visual modifications, as I have never coded before and I'm still learning. The three significant modifications are: adding custom home screen music\u00a0(made on Garage Band by me), adding custom in-game music (made on Garage Band by me), and adding a third \"extreme level\", where the player has the chance to destroy as many enemies as possible before losing their health, giving them a chance at the high score. I also added a few new sound effects, switched the name, and made some other minor cosmetic changes. Lastly, I fixed the bugs in my tutorial and now the game is bug-free.</p>\n<p>Created by:\u00a0Sydney Bowler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/132f749db5dbfc21467d857158237775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["sydneypb"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
