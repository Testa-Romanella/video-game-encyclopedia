{"id": 977646, "slug": "gnomber", "name": "Gnomber", "name_original": "Gnomber", "description": "Gnomber is a rogue-like action game, where you use different bombs to blow away your enemies and combine them with perks to become overpowered. The game physics allow you to knock enemies into each other or walls, use the knockback from your explosions to throw projectiles and eliminate enemies in creative ways. Place the bombs strategically, kite your enemies, lead them into your explosions, decide which bombs and perks to pick based on the enemies' weaknesses and survive the onslaught.<h3>Knock enemies around</h3>Enemies can be knocked against each other or into any other thing in the game.<br/><h3>Combine perks to enhance bombs</h3>You receive perks on each level-up which can be combined with bombs to enhance them.<br/><br/>In the gif above, the <strong>Mist Bomb</strong> is combined with a healing explosion perk to heal the player multiple times on each explosion. And the multiplying <strong>Crystal Bomb</strong> is combined with a perk that creates spinning orbs on each explosion. Be careful which perks you choose, as some of them may improve one bomb, but weaken another one.<h3>Unique bombs</h3>Each bomb has a unique explosion and effect. Try them all!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T06:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d02919646bc424de23bdf384490235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LisiSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LisiSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
