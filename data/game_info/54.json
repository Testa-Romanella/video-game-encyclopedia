{"id": 54, "slug": "punch-club", "name": "Punch Club", "name_original": "Punch Club", "description": "<p>Punch Club is a cross between sports management and The Sims, packed together in the retro pixel-art style. The plot is based on the 1980s and 1990s action movie staples and is full of ironic references and quotes from them. You play as a young boxing prodigy whose father was murdered by a stranger. Your goal is to become a great sportsman and win a tournament, but also to investigate and avenge your father\u2019s death. The player controls his character around the clock, making him exercise, eat, go to the job, buy food and other items, and interact with other characters. <br />\nWorking out will improve the boxer\u2019s main characteristics, such as strength and stamina, moving him towards his goal. But there are also essential Sims-like attributes like hunger and happiness that wear down during activities and need to be replenished. Money is also essential and can be earned by performing jobs and quests or by winning boxing matches. Before each fight, be it a match or an assault by a street gang, you choose a number of skills that the boxer will use this time. Completing quests will earn you favors from the other characters that will help you to advance the central plot and find the murderer.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2016-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T21:40:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad1/ad15e71b0a3d431ce0a59bcd783efa88.jpg", "website": "http://tinybuild.com/punchclub", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 122, "owned": 2123, "beaten": 204, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 170, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 145, "ratings_count": 368, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 374, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Linux", "Android", "iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Nintendo 3DS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["tinyBuild", "Lazy Bear Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
