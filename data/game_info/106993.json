Then defeat the Zerg boss to complete the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FPS Sci-fi hostage rescue. A quick single level demo of a project I have been working on in Unity. I have always liked the \"on rails\" FPS shooters that made you think a little. Those\u00a0like Half-Life and Halo that where more than just a \"kill everything\" experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo is a simple concept of a single level that would be part of a much larger storyline.\u00a0I'm going to continue to expand the game but I'm going to start it all over again. There are many things I don't like about it but it's a good start. This is also the first project that I can say is \"good enough\" to publish. I have dozens of uncompleted projects so this is a bit of a milestone for me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you find it entertaining for 5 minutes. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Doors may prevent bullets to pass when line of sight is very close to the frame of the door.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/947fc112eee670d22f7ac61eecbf4c7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1stGenGamer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
