Experience their saga without brain-crunching puzzles or grinding through random battles. Play as different animals from the three Majesti factions; herbivore, carnivore, and scavenger.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no profanity, blood/gore, sexual content...or lame dialogue and cheap endings!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHard-core RPG gamers should note that there is no inventory management or traits/abilities/skill point management. There are items that will help win battles, but no equpiment or other character management.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T03:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/494c4e03bb51da875c39f763bfdcc456.jpg", "website": "http://www.wisedadgames.com/the-majesti.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wise Dad Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Wise Dad Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
