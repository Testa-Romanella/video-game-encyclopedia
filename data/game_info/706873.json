{"id": 706873, "slug": "spell-breaker", "name": "Spell Breaker", "name_original": "Spell Breaker", "description": "<p>SpellBreaker is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer, where the player must run through several levels, and defeat numerous enemies to progress. They will have to brave challenging levels and combat various enemy lines, all while standing their ground with two weapons in their arsenal.<br/></p>\n<p>Leading up to the game, the protagonist experiences the destruction of their village and\u00a0everyone in it, courtesy of the Dark Wizard. Now, it is up to the Protagonist to fight through the Dark Wizard\u2019s forces and rise up to challenge him and end his evil forever. However, be warned, the Protagonist has quite a journey ahead of them.</p>\n<p>The Protagonist will venture into the Dark Wizard's castle. Here they will face strange enemies and use both melee and ranged attacks to power their way through to the grand chamber of the castle, where there will be a battle of great proportions to end the reign of the Dark Wizard once and for all.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s difficulty curve will steepen with each passing level, culminating in the boss\u00a0battle against the wizard. Challenging obstacles will scale with the Protagonist\u2019s experience and skill throughout the game. The starting weapons are a core mechanic that the player must become proficient with to progress through to the end of the game. Also, there are platforming aspects providing a challenging field to fight and maneuver in. Only by fighting your way through the hordes of darkness and stopping the wizard\u2019s spell for good can you bring peace back to your home.</p>\n\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n\r\nPOSTMORTEM\r\n<p>Our programming team worked very well together overall and we overcame a lot of challenges, including hard to reproduce bugs, game maker oddities, and git issues. We should've allocated more time to research and efficiently writing the code- breaking down our works into sizeable chunks would've done wonders. For some our programmers there was definitely a steep learning curve to tackle, but our lead programmer was there to support the team every step of the way.<br/></p>\n<p>When it comes to the Art, Spell Breaker went through a few changes. The processes of developing the game in a short span of time, the tedious process of creating likable characters as well as polishing all the work to have it flow cohesively are some of many reasons why Spell Breaker ran into a few adjustments. The biggest adjustment of the game that was driven by an Art based decision was editing of the storyline. In our original pitch of our game, Spell Breaker was to begin in a level that was located on a medieval farm. This overestimation was addressed a few weeks into development; the decision was made that due to the limited time frame there was simply not enough time to create an outdoor level unless we significantly changed the narrative of the final battle in Spell Breaker.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6be01a594dc084b3c107a3ed62bef22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maya55", "Abysswalker00", "Shaik_Pasha", "voidmist707", "manchmalscott"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
