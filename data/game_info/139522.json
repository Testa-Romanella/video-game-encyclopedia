Special attack - more damage, but you can only use it so often, and Healing - returns some health, but can only be used once in a while</li></ul>\n<p>The trick is to time it so you use the right ability, at the right time, compared to your health and that of your opponent, while taking into consideration how many rounds of fighting you have left (each battle has 3 rounds). It's worth noting here, that the 3rd fight is always tougher.</p>\n<p>Between fighting, you can use any Bandages you may have to heal your champion. You can buy more bandages, and you will sometimes find some after a fight.</p>\n<p>You gain Reputation points as you progress, as sort of a lifetime score. As your reputation grows, you will unlock new titles for yourself.</p>\n<p>Spend acquired Gold on upgrades or individual Bandages. Upgrades are random and may increase your stats, or give you a bunch of Bandages all at the same time. Improving a champion may also unlock a new nickname for them.</p>\n<p>In Settings, you can turn the music off or reset your champion (currently broken).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aacfc0e7602f0f548d67663e933946c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Rasmus Rasmussen"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
