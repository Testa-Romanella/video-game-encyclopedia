Players jump automatically to the beat of music, and generate a damaging ripple when landing on the water's surface. The player's offensive and defensive options are collapsed into movement, which is in turn dictated by the music. Ripples is an experience where music is not just an accessory to the mechanics, but a driver of action.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea8dbcd308f9c35366f4e1caf58186fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delta Squad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
