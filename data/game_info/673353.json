I start making it cuz i didn't knew what to do with python. Also i published my last game ~60 days ago. So i started development. To be honestly the most of time i was thinking about game ideas. I done full game (except sounds and some mini things) in ~3-4 days.</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S: the game can be flagged as virus by some antiviruses. It's not a virus. If you don't trust me you can check source code. Im sharing it on github (link in links)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/063697db240f805037b53da67bd8c95a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DryCarrot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
