At this point in time, I don't plan on adding more to this. It was just a test of my programming knowledge but I figured I'd share this one with you.</p>\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>The AI will seek out tasks at random. They will gather food, chop trees, mine ore, etc. Every simulation you create is given a random world width and height. Upon creating a new world, the program will do some math to determine how much trees, rocks, and humans will be placed depending on world size. And that's it. Not too much, but it's fun to see how the population rises and falls depending on lack or abundance of resources, if a plague hits, and other random events.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f6a28380ecf477a034f00ef4796068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrackedGhostGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
