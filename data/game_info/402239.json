Running this game on an older version of PowerPoint, or PowerPoint Online, PowerPoint Mobile, or Google Slides, or anything else of that sort, most likely will\u00a0lead to compatibility/performance issues, and the game may be unplayable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is also intensive on computer resources, so if your computer is crap, then there may be some lag.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are also lots of flashing lights and imagery. If you have epilepsy,, and/or flashing lights or imagery triggers seizures, don\u2019t play this game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is a demo created by JHXC for the PowerPoint Game Jam, hosted by PPTDEV on itch.io. If this game is further worked on, note that the content of this demo is 1. owned by JHXC (NO STEALING. STEALING BAD), and 2. subject to change from the creation of this demo.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:05:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7db12f357bb7eef8aef76139c79249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JHXC"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
