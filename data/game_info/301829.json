Maybe your family was carted to the nearest chain seafood restaurant. Maybe you escaped the local aquarium. The only thing that really matters is how SHARP your knife is. Use your knife to destroy objects and solve puzzles before you face the biggest bad a crab has ever seen other than a wooden mallet.</p>\n<p>Knife 2 Meat U is a short, 15 minute experience from Very Very Spaceship, a small collaborative game studio based in Seattle. K2MU was built during a 1-week internal game jam as a procedural animation test, along with some other experiments you may see in the future!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - move<br/><strong>mouse</strong> - camera<br/><strong>RMB</strong> - attack<br/><strong>LMB</strong> - grab<br/><strong>Space</strong> - jump<br/><strong>Shift</strong> - run</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Wanna see what else we're up to?
