Just another full-time employee spending Saturdays doing hobbies like this.

To save his\u00a0 people, they made a pact that the demon will do all in his power to prevent the fall of <strong>gKingdom</strong>, in exchange for the souls of the entire royal family. The demon knows that the destruction of the kingdom is inevitable, but has managed to undo everything that has happened days before the invasion, trapping everyone within the time loop...</p>\n<p><em>-Mechanics-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em><br/>Castle is under siege by monsters! The last line of defense has fallen, and the only way to protect the castle by hiring battle maidens (though we knew they're just some teenage girls with nothing better to do). Deploy them to strategic places and they'll be kicking monsters in no time (if they manage to survive, that is). Once a single monster gets past through the gates, it's all over (or should I say, the timeline gets back to day 1, preventing the fall of <strong>gKingdom</strong>).</p>\n\n<p><em>-Features-</em> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Hire Battle Maidens to aid you in protecting the castle!
