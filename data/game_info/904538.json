The leaderboard only displays the top 100 (\"NC\" if you are not ranked).\r\nEvery 3rd of the month, the old ranking is reset in order to start a new ranking.\r\nThe Adojuru game contains music to help you relax while playing, and a random button to launch the game according to your choices.\r\nUntil then, have fun and don't forget to donate to us to help the team in their work.\r\nBest day/evening to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T06:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/7385eeacf96418cd3bbbd358d3740faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Melchiade"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
