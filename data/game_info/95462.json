Explore their hazardous surfaces as you rescue your stranded crew, salvage lost cargo, and zap hordes of enemies. Can you survive long enough to reach the Mysterious Planet X? Or will you be consumed by a slime, zapped by an enemy blaster, boiled in acid, or choked to death by a toxic atmosphere?</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys/Directional Pad - Move</li><li>[Z] - Jump (tap, or hold for higher jumps)</li><li>[X] - Use Held Item</li><li>[Down] + [X] - Pick up / Swap Item</li></ul>\r\nSCORE\r\n<p>There are several ways to earn score as you traverse a planet's surface:</p>\n<ul><li>Bopping enemies</li><li>Zapping enemies</li><li>Securing cargo</li><li>Transporting friendly crew off the surface</li><li>Completing levels</li><li>Blasting off from the planet in a new Star Cruiser</li><li>Several secret bonuses you'll need to discover!</li></ul>\r\nPLANETS\r\n<p>As you delve deeper into space, the planets will expand in size, add more difficult room layouts and variations, increase the chance for high gravity, unlock new hazardous biomes (including burning lava planets, sliding ice planets, and rare toxic atmospheres!), more challenging enemy variants, more enemy crew, and fewer useful items to help you along the way. While the first few planets might not cause you much trouble, by the time you reach the Mysterious Planet X, you'll need the skills and bravery of a true Space Ranger to survive!</p>\n\r\nSPECIES\r\n<p>Humans are boring! While they're the most common species in the Space Rangers, the other sentient species have special bonuses to help in their adventures.\u00a0 Along with all the random features of each planet, you'll need to accustom yourself to the unique ability of your randomly chosen cadet.</p>\n<p>Can you reach the Mysterious Planet X with a cadet from every species?<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Game by @tmi_robot.
