The player has to survive as long as it can and will be given a score at the end of the game. The peculiarity of this game is that the player's vehicle eventually begins losing parts, both over time and because of the enemy shooting, therefore the player has to collect components from the enemy robots to fix the lost parts. Loosing 10 pieces means defeat. The in-game model of the car shows in real-time which parts are lost. The gameplay is affected by losing pieces, for example, if you lose one of the 3 barriers (front, left, right) enemies are going to be able to damage you directly by hitting you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:39:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2a5aa6e1364e961205f355315e6b228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["firepro20"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
