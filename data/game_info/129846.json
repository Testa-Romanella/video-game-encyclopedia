That is, until you start bleeding from your eyeballs from all the rage.</p><p>Official Page: etkworks.com/flux</p><p>Fill your rage bar by violently beating the blood out of your foes. The more rage you have, the more damage you will do. But be careful, too much rage and your health starts dropping. Release that rage for a short burst of power and invincibility at the cost of going back to square one, with zero rage.</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>A permanently bloody, angry, and fast-paced brawler.
