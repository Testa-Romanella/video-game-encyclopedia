It was made entirely between July 2nd and July 11th 2021</p>\n<p>Take control of Chico, the chubby-cheeked chipmunk, as he explores magical worlds to build up his stash of giant walnuts for the winter. Chico can jump around when his hands are free, and he can roll the walnuts around to press switches and solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>Keyboard and controllers are supported. Press Start/Enter to pause and change color palettes!\u00a0There is an intro level, a home base, and one additional level completed. I hope to finish the rest of the levels I had planned some day post-jam.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Kerrie Lake for color palettes \"Ice Cream\", \"Mist\", and \"Coldfire\"</li><li>lospec user archer-a for color palette \"Minty Fresh\"</li><li>Tom Vian for Chiptone which was used to generate sound effects</li><li>Matt Walkden for Glimmer Sans font</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f814113f6b3a8b8458909cc75d5218b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Ver Voort"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
