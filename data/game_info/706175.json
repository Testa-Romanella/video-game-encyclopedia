Her village was raided by a group of mechanized robots. Confused and angered, Lily wanders the forest hoping for answers of who has sent these robots. She stumbles upon a seemingly magical shrine where she finds a katana. The katana seems to be imbued with overwhelming power, but realizing she came unarmed she picks it up immediately feeling unstoppable. Only taking a couple Kendo courses, she is unsure of whether she could even wield the weapon. She tries to take on one of the robots and realizes the blade instantly eviscerates her foe.
