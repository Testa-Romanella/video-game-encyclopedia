With a pumpkin. Why not.</p>\n<p>Play alone or challenge a friend on awesome fun local multiplayer and score those goals. Anything goes, monsters don't care about fouls or throw ins anyway. Also, they kinda ate the referee.</p>\n<p>The game supports game controllers and favors xbox ones, so make sure you have a couple of those to fully enjoy the experience.</p>\n<p>Oh and for the first player, the game supports EyeX eye tracking hardware for choosing players and passing to them easier using just your eyes. Awesome huh?</p>\n<p>This is a WIP project, so some bugs are in there.
