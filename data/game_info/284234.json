Place 40 different items ranging from televisions to eyeballs, chain together waving arms and spinning saw blades, and build massive towers of donuts! Use the time slider to slow down time and build complex assemblages of objects.<br/><br/>As you build your sculpture, watch as its value increases based on what you choose to include. Impress or bore the museum audience with the shock value of your work. When you're finished, Super Sculptor will generate a name for your work that it deems appropriate. No longer must the artist feel conflicted about naming their piece!<br/><br/>Some objects even include camera functionality, so you can include real-life subject matter in your work. Draw inspiration from all around you!<br/><br/>// Coming Soon! //<br/>\u2013 New objects!<br/>\u2013 Different pedestal types!<br/>\u2013\u00a0Object rotation!<br/>\u2013 Interactive objects!<br/><br/>// Performance  //<br/><br/>Super Sculptor's performance varies depending on the device you're using and how many objects you have added. Newer hardware is highly recommended and this application has not been optimized for 4 devices!<br/><br/>// Localization //<br/><br/>This app is currently available in English only, but true art knows no language.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T01:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bba531b4ddd2d7bd2d8db27816f809a_3YWtywx.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Shillingburg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Michael Shillingburg"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
