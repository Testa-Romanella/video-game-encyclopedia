What was once a holding place of the horrid creatures is now their domain. Silence is your ally and noise is your enemy. Equipped with only a bow, you must escape the dilapidated den before they are all alerted by your presence. As you explore, you must make every shot and every step count because one step in the wrong direction could be your last mistake. Running should be a last resort, but it is VERY ill advised otherwise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:47:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f235be8902ac437603dc11c96b9f9aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crimzen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
