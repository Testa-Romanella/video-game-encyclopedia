This is my first project and as such it's a little confusing to understand at first, however, the more you play the easier it gets (and more importantly) the better you'll get as you get to know the world, making the game easier every time you play.\u00a0It isn't perfect but I'm really happy with how it turned out (considering this is my first time programming). Hopefully you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T07:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b4bfadd28d3cf887e0540ab87093c74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["InLimbo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
