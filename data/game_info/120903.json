Your followers are a bunch of plebs and have no idea what to do, so you'll need to direct them every step of the way!<br/><br/>Left-click on plebs to select them, and right click to direct their path. Right-clicking on a tree will order them to harvest it, while right-clicking on the statue will cause the pleb to sacrifice itself for the greater good.<br/><br/>Harvesting trees and sacrificing plebs gains you religious zeal which you can use to build houses for more plebs, or for bombs to fend off the impending demon invasion.<br/><br/>Don't stand on your own bombs. You have 6 minutes to prepare.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4415227aab0033d4ce77a59b23b5b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maldruzard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
