You play with your friends in an endless, non-stop tournament, with multiple weapons and stages. Your goal is to defeat the other players\u2019 slimes and be the last slime standing at the end of each round. Each stage has a unique gimmick as well, ranging from explosive barrels to death lasers. Weapons are designed to reward risk-taking and constant movement, as well as creativity to create combos with both equipped weapons. The game can support up to four local players, and supports both keyboard/mouse controls and gamepad controls. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T12:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8ef277609a26cfc36f769f35566c65b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paulhuanv23", "ElexMcCoy", "RyanChang", "Mstoecker7", "BoranChen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
