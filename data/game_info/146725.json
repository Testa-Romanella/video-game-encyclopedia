I haven't played the game since but it has always been in a special place in my memory, so I wanted to make a simpler version of the game, but in the way that I remember, using only my memory as reference. I've done it as an entry for \"One Game a Month\" using PICO-8.</p><p>The game is quite simple, take the lepicons from one portal to another using themselves as tools, or even sacrificing some for a greater good.</p><p>Controls: (are explained in game as well)<br/></p><ul><li>Arrows move the cursors</li><li>Z changes the action to be applied (check the bar on the bottom)</li><li>X applies the action to the lepicon closest to the cursor</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/7265f065dd0ecda9214f7806bc9d86c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andre Castel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
