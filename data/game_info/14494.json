It puts gamers in a spatial setting, where they have to manage several puzzle elements (mostly gears) and must make quick decisions which can simplify or complicate their path to victory. <br/><br/>Plith is a fast paced game which contains a lot of levels \u2013 more than 100 \u2013 to be solved. The player moves some gears and can place them on the level; some gears rotate, and transmit their rotation to the adjacent ones: the objective of each level is to activate the target gears. These levels constitute five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections. Each section introduces new gameplay elements; for example, several kinds of gears and obstacles come out along the game. The game is presented using mostly 3D graphics, with a few handmade drawings as well.Key Features: <br/><ul><li>Five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections <br/></li><li>More than 100 levels <br/></li><li>Fast paced <br/></li><li>Several gameplay elements (e.g. several kinds of gears and obstacles)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68e1d776c502ce6a5c035190169db4a8.jpg", "website": "http://flyinginteractive.com/plith/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 99}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ya2"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flying Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
