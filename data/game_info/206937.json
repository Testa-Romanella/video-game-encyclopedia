Each game was cobbled together, one person at a time, with nobody knowing what they would be working on until they got it. It was an experiment in collaboration and building on the work of others. It was also an exercise in creativity, letting go of intention and surrendering to the communal flow. It was a lot of fun!</p>\n\n<p>Six people worked on the Twine track. It started out as quick romp through the offerings of a candy store, and it evolved into a sprawling psychedelic labyrinth of sugar-induced fever dreams and hellscapes, including getting trapped in a Burger Time machine and living out your days as a twin gummy worm.</p>\n<p>Final game is above.
