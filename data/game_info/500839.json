You arrived to their sale hoping to find your favorite Arcade, after several hours you found it in a corner, it appears to be there for quite sometime, maybe you can get a good price. You talked with the Arcade owner and gave you a discount since the motherboard is stuck in a loop and keep playing the same level. Once home, you plug it and tested, you feel a strange vibration on your fingertips, you open your eyes and you don\u2019t know where you are, but it\u2019s not home. You hear the familiar sounds of Loopertary, look around and noticed that you are now inside it, at least you know your way out, btw, what was that about the motherboard? I don\u2019t recall.</p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay - Neverending level, where you need to defeat all the foes in the level using the right elements, once you do that, you can face the boss, and then reset your game.</li><li>Enemies -</li></ul>\n<p>Water Enemies (Blue): they will chase you throught the level leaving a wet trail behind them. If you step on it will slide you to a nearby tile.</p>\n<ul><li>Vulnerable to Air Bullets (Teal).</li></ul>\n<p>Fire Enemies (Orange): they jump to free tiles and set them on fire. You cannot step on burning tiles, although you will be able to move out of a burning tile if you were placed there by an enemy.</p>\n<ul><li>Vulnerable to Water Bullets (Blue).</li></ul>\n<p>Air Enemies (Teal/Gray): just like wind they are on the way, but you need to defeat them.</p>\n<ul><li>Vulnerable to Fire Bullets (Orange).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Controls - This game supports gamepad.
