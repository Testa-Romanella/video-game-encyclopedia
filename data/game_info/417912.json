Though complete, <strong>Trip 2: Trip War</strong> was never released until now.\u00a0 It is a two-player only strategy-dogfighting hybrid. <br/></p>\n<p>You are daring pilots of lightning-fast <strong>Trip Ships</strong> in the year 2060, embroiled in a bitter war. Who will be victorious? <br/></p>\n<p>The aim is to shoot down your opponent, while collecting powerups to increase your speed, shot power and shield.<br/></p>\n<p>In <strong>War Mode</strong>, the players must also play a turn-based strategy game to aquire territory on the map, building and upgrading while sending your <strong>Trip Ships</strong> into combat.<br/></p>\n<p>For Amiga with 1mb+ ram. 2 Player only. <br/></p>\n<p>Tested on A4000/030 / stock A1200.\u00a0 May not work on emulation.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>* * *\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Author's note:<br/></p>\n<p>I am releasing this as Pay What You Want, in the hope of raising some additional funds for my new game, a project I've been working on for over eight years. If you liked Lone Survivor and want to help my next game along, this would be a great way of supporting me!</p>\n<p>Thanks,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jasper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18d1c627083bee201d8b9b9821539242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superflatsonic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
