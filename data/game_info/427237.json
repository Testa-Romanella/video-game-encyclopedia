What are the controls?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls are based on your current perspective\u00a0(Keyboard )</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Rotate mountain forward/backward - \"W/S\" /\u00a0\"up/down arrow\u00a0\"</li><li>Rotate mountain left/right - \"A/D\" / \"left/right arrow\u00a0\"</li><li>Rotate camera - \"Q/E\" / \", / .\"</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Q: How does this game relate to the theme ?</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0 This is game has a pretty literal interpretation of the theme. You will need to \"balance\" the ball down a winding path down a mountain by spinning the mountain (like those\u00a0labyrinth marble games, which is basically where this idea originated from).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is the goal of the game?</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: As you descend the mountain, coins will appear along the path which you can collect to gain points. Your highscore is based on the amount of coins collected before plummeting to your death.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-made Assets Credits (UI sprites, 3D models, and music &amp; sounds)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/nature-kit</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-rpg-expansion</li><li>https://www.zapsplat.com/</li></ul>\n\n<p>Bugs Found (That I'll fix when this jam is completely over)</p>\n<ul><li>Web version: \"Quit Game\" freezes game requiring you to refresh</li><li>I forgot to loop the music so it stops after 4 minutes</li><li>A section in the harder part lacks coins</li><li>The corner fence is very sticky and you will need to nudge the mountain a lot in the right direction to free yourself</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Made by ye boi</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://jarrett-ang.itch.io/\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e677c67d1794dec9d1476e8603fac84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jarrett Ang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
