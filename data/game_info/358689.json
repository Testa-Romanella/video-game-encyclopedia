Korbis will encounter a whole matter of Odd events and life forms along the way. He may even take a detour into a bizarre mini adventure (there's quite a few)\u00a0This game is fun, weird, and hopefully pleasantly surprising.\u00a0The game will be challenging at times, but rewarding. I placed lots of saves along the way, and tried to make sure there was multiple things to enjoy in each level. The game was a bit of a Jam type project, made in a month, and packed with things that made me happy, i hope it makes you happy too!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>ARROWS FOR MOVEMENT</p>\n<p>X to JUMP</p>\n<p>C to Dash</p>\n<p>SHIFT or TAB-When instructed to do things like talk to some goop in a Peanut Butter Jar\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits and special thanks:</p>\n<p>@TheWakingCloak, @Neipo, Corvos\u00a0, @anIdeaGuy /\u00a0Rediscover, @Kyle_Toom/ @MessanInABottle, @LtFarian, @Aw0_aj,\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Martha Stewart for all her support.</p>\n<p>Intended Force Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Sandywifey31S\u00a0https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/68436/vegan-brownies/<br/></p>\n<p>All the lovely people i spoofed.</p>\n<p>Toast.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>GET YOUR KICKS ON ROUTE 66!</p>\n<p>TAKE A MAP!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef992001767d0cf002571529888e873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALLIE CAT GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
