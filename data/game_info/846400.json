{"id": 846400, "slug": "platfuzzles", "name": "Platfuzzles", "name_original": "Platfuzzles", "description": "<h3>Put on Your Thinking Cap</h3>Each level is designed as a short puzzle: how do you go about acquiring your powers and then how do you use them to reach the goal? <br/>Powers are always reset at the beginning of a level, and not all of them are always available, so each level has you working in a new way.<h3>Six Powers</h3>Jump, dash, pound, shoot lasers, turn invisible (and invulnerable), and slow down objects to achieve victory.<h3>Single Player or Co-op</h3>There are 20 one-player levels, and 20 more two-player levels, for approximately 5 hours of gameplay.<br/>In co-op, you get just as many powers as in single player, so you have to share these powers between yourselves in order to reach the goal.<h3>Your Own Disq</h3>Players can choose between eight colours and eight accessories to customise their character, an amicable individual named Disq.<h3>Precision Is Key</h3>You can plan your way through a stage, or figure it out through trial and error. Either way, hitting a hazard resets the level. This game is best played by people who are patient and dedicated to success!<br/>A practice stage is available if you want to work on a particular motion in a safe environment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T05:53:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa33b569035d400c1f072d5acc31605e.jpg", "website": "https://www.hydrargyria.com/platfuzzles", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hydrargyria"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hydrargyria"], "esrb_rating": null}
