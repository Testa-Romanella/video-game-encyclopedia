In this game, you start your journey as a criminal mastermind when you're around 9 years old! Put the puzzle pieces together and find the resolutions to move forward upon your path of evil. (With Adam of course) <br/></p>\n<p>No need to describe how to play, the game has its own tutorial! If a puzzle piece doesn't snap, it probably isn't gonna work! Make sure you hear the snap noise. (I say this because there isn't really a good way to explain the way it works) The big box in the tutorial doesn't stay on your screen after it finishes typing the text so don't speed it up and expect to have time to read it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0ad8c69226a054bbd84858de93938e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedSweaterBill"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
