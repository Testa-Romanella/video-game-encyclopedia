Sometimes you will want a planet with as many kinds of ore as possible, and sometimes it will be more efficient to choose a planet with fewer ore types.</p><p>When you reach a planet, it's time to dive. Click to dive from your ship's platform and use the mouse to guide your miner on his way down. Try to avoid orbital debris in order to build up as much speed as possible.</p><p>When you hit the planet's surface, you start mining down. You will lose speed as you mine deeper so try to collect as much ore as possible before you come to a stop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0ac902fdee72508c3c3db148c71dc657.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matt kelly"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
