I want to create an original\u00a0pickup, complete with its own script function, sound effect, and sprite. Or perhaps create/script something that explodes to damage the player/or enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level 1 will be completely retiled, and reworked to add challenges.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0will also create a brand new level 2 + 3,\u00a0instead of replicating level 1, with its own obstacles and goals. I will\u00a0expand the size of the game itself to have more room to work with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0think I will also create minor adjustments to game music and sound effects, and \u00a0foreground tile detailing as time allocates.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T05:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4a117ab8233e1d37dc92b160c5ef3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["impylukkarila"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
