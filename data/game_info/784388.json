{"id": 784388, "slug": "anchors-deep", "name": "ANCHORS DEEP", "name_original": "ANCHORS DEEP", "description": "<p><em>Anchors Deep</em>\u00a0is a stylized action adventure game\u00a0with a focus on combat and strong narrative themes. There is one tutorial and 3 mini levels with engaging combat that ramps up as the player travels through the game. The strong narrative elements like NPCs and voiceovers clue the player into how they\u2019re perceived in the game. While the audiovisual design of the game is zany and dark, the dialogue conveys a more lighthearted, comedic tone.\r\n </p>\n\n<p><strong>THE STORY:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For thousands and thousands years, Fishnity has lived under Humanity\u2019s shadow. Massacred, tortured, and even eaten!\r\n </p>\n<p>The massacre on Fishnity never ends and they have no choice but escape the grasp of the evil Trident Seafood Corporation!\r\n </p>\n<p>Now, with the heinous corporation\u2019s new technology, Fishnity has no way to escape, and no place to hide. They need their hero again, the one who fought with everything and suddenly disappeared thousands of years ago \u2014 they need the legendary Fish Guardian..\r\n </p>\n<p>After the years of brutal torture and harm on his people, the Fish Guardian awakens!
