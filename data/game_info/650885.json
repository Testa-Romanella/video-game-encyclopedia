Outmaneuver your frenemies and shatter them into colorful bits.<h3>ARENAS</h3>Battle around the galaxy in fifteen arenas, with new ones coming. Classic asteroids, icy comets, mythical monsters, curious contraption, it is all there for you to chart a route before the match. Each arena puts you in perils, which you can turn into opportunities and use to your advantage<h3>SHIPS</h3>All the ships in Have a Blast are small and nimble, enabling you to navigate the busy arenas. Each of the five ships has a unique powerful ability, requiring a slightly different approach. But even the strongest attacks can be countered, and it is never too late to turn the tide of battle to your side.<h3>GAME MODES</h3><ul><li><strong>Deathmatch</strong> \u2013 Last pilot standing wins the round in this familiar mode.

Great opportunity to reinforce some friendships and ruin others.<br/></li><li><strong>Mothership</strong> \u2013 Keep your mothership safe and it will provide you with health, ammo and some refuge.

Driven by a capable AI, they can provide some challenge when friends are not around; or you can use them to add energy to matches. If the adaptive AI gets frustrating or too easy, you can always adjust the challenge from the menu.<h3>CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS</h3>With full support for Steam Input, it should work with most controllers out there. You can build your own input configuration and you can choose from three flying schemes from within the game itself. You can even fly with your keyboard, you just can\u2019t win.<h3>ONLINE VIA REMOTE PLAY TOGETHER</h3>We know it is not always possible to have your friends on the same sofa, heck, we haven\u2019t been on the same sofa in months. Luckily Have a Blast works really well with Remote Play Together  and was extensively tested with it. It\u2019s how we have been making this game for the last year.<h3>WE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR RETRO-INSPIRED MODERN-DESIGNED ARCADE!</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c1c382decef679041f980527b1c7de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bojan Endrovski"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Firenut Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
