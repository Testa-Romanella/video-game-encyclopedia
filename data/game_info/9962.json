{"id": 9962, "slug": "duelyst", "name": "Duelyst", "name_original": "Duelyst", "description": "<p>Duelyst is a digital collectible card game and turn-based strategy hybrid. The game has four expansions: Denizens of Shim&#39;zar, Rise of the Bloodborn, Ancient Bonds, and Unearthed Prophecy. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In each round, two players must fight across a tactical battlefield. They take turns in which they play, changing position minions and spells represented by cards.<br />\nThe players aim to build a card deck and move across the field, gaining points and eliminating enemies. The winner is the player who reduces the enemy General&#39;s health to zero before they can do so to you. The cards are drawn from a custom built deck. The round continues until one of the players kills the biggest enemy. The game offers a practice mode, puzzle-like challenges, a ranked season ladder, and a draft-style tournament mode. Each match lasts less than 10 minutes, so the game is quite fast-paced. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>There are six factions, each with its characteristics. The factions&#39; appearance and special abilities affect the strategy and gameplay of the decks. There are also more than 700 cards for spells, minions, and artifacts. The Duelyst offers several arenas with various features and design. Every month the game media pages provide lists of power ranking depicting the best custom decks.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2016-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-26T19:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c1685229a455d3a0affb8cbc78e2d09.jpg", "website": "https://duelyst.com/", "rating": 3.39, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 43, "owned": 944, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 77, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 100, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 101, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Counterplay Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US", "Counterplay Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
