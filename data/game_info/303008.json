It consists of a single boss fight against a cyclops who shoots out projectiles from the center of the screen, and from skull turrets in the corners. His attacks change as his health drops, spawning clones and increasing his deadly projectiles, as he dances for your defeat.</p>\n<p>The game is in no way perfect as the projectiles spawn randomly, but it's damn fun to have a quick try.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b024672ca7657bdb9aa2e75c5d7849b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThomasBradstreet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
