This is not a Doom mod, but rather a separate game with its own weapons, levels, and textures; we took some GUI textures from FreeDOOM to save time, but they will be replaced in future versions. We're planning to eventually remake this game with a more capable graphics engine like OGRE or IrrLicht.</p>\n\r\nSee README.HTM for more info!\r\nLegal info:\r\n<p>ENGINE SOURCE CODE: https://github.com/rheit/zdoom\r\n  </p>\n<p>ENGINE LICENSE: GPLv3\r\n</p>\n<p>GAME SOURCE CODE: No need to provide it, simply open the WADs with a tool like SLADE\r\n    </p>\n<p>GAME-SPECIFIC SCRIPT LICENSE: MIT License\r\n</p>\n<p>GRAPHICS AND SOUNDS LICENSE: Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International</p>\n<p>Used software: Blender, SLADE, Doom Builder, OpenMPT, LMMS, Audacity, The GIMP, and ZDoom; <strong>all of those are Free Software.</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Music: MCL, Looki2000, and Wansti<br/></p>\n<p>Non-GUI Textures: Looki2000</p>\n<p>GUI/HUD textures: MCL and FreeDOOM contributors.<br/></p>\n<p>Level design: MCL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T15:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/476dbc058c557f5c4e8277e91fb53980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MCL Software"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
