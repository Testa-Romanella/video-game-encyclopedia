There are seven game screens. On each screen, a definition is presented at the bottom of the screen and the user must chose the correction term from the choice above. Both the arrangement of the answers and the order in which the definitions appear are randomized each time the level is played.\u00a0 Users can press the \u201cH\u201d key in order to reveal the answer, but this will deduct increasing points from the score. A report at the end indicates which levels were played and a final total score.<br/>This is a TOTAL FREEWARE Windows program. This means there are no ads, no registration, no collection of any data, no internet connection, and no limit to installations or distribution. The program will run on Windows versions 7 through 10.\u00a0 Download the zipped setup program, extract it and run it. There is an uninstall option included.<br/>Please send all comments and questions to rtcarman47@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8c083b412b88bd9d1b2717a35321fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rtcgames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
