Where you play as a new student at Nellis Noble Academy, a secret magic school that teaches its students with the goal of integrating them with the majority of non-magical human society in the hopes of developing a relationship of goodwill. If the mention of superhumans feels out of place, don\u2019t worry, that will come into play later.\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently, I only have part of the first chapter written. I would like to receive the whole gambit of feedback. Any errors you come across, inconsistencies, coding errors, narrative awkwardness and generally what you\u2019re interested in regarding the setting and characters.\r\n</p>\n<p>RO\u2019s: Alexander Vega; A young man who possesses an intense love for knowledge as well as for sharing it. He is excited to begin learning magic, especially the arcane.\r\n</p>\n<p>Eliza Buren; A young woman who has a passion for everything mechanical, hoping to wield Tech Magic to build what will be considered the most advanced technology of the current century.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hussein Benglish; A young hard working man, grateful to have been accepted into the Academy so that he can forge a fruitful life for himself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ramona Thalius; A young woman with a great love for art and life, including everything that exists a little past conventional life who wishes to find someone who shares that fascination.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ilsa Vanarie; A second-year student who enjoys using her magic for mischief and using her charm to present a good first impression.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T08:45:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd8c4efce8981b41c39f2090998ef39c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["VelmiaWarin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
