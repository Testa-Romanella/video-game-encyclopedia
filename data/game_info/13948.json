With the Muscle Memory System you can intuitively control all your limbs and even tweak your muscle memory to create a unique style. To get the edge necessary to defeat a worthy opponent, you can override your muscle memory to make adjustments to your strikes in real time. When we have the autonomy to craft the execution of an individual strike when we see an opening a deeper level of immersion unfolds. <br/><br/>Reverence currently supports mouse, keyboard, gamepad, and virtual reality devices. Motion controller support coming Q4 2016. <strong>Reverence does NOT require VR</strong>.ATTENTION VR USERSThe VR integration is at a very early, and in some ways, experimental stage. Unless you would like to actively support development, we suggest waiting to purchase the game for more polished VR experience. Feedback from early adopters will help to shape the VR integration. Also, please note that motion controller support is coming soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e77d5ed69aefecff6b151389bd448ee.jpg", "website": "http://www.MantisStudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mantis Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mantis Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
