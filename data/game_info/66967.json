This unique take on the genre challenges you to perform high-flying stunts in the name of entertainment. Simply hold your finger over the wrestler to trigger one of 6 different jumps, and then flick up and away to determine the power. Keep touching in front of the wrestler to spin forwards or to the rear to spin backwards. You can even tilt the device for bonus momentum! Land nicely to execute one of 17 different moves and see if you can discover them all.<br/><br/>For bonus points, you can also stack tables to smash through! Simply press and hold over a table to walk with it and release it over another to stack them. Look out for passing opponents that you can also take out if you're quick enough.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffb15f24bac131c1e228a1a59bbc9984.jpg", "website": "http://", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MDickie"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["MDickie"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
