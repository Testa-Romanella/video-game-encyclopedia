This game was an exploration of what I can do with the limited scope of my skills.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a small, blue square person, who has to avoid the lava which is slowly rising from the ground. To avoid the lava, you have to jump, wall-jump and weave your way around giant black platforms that surround you.</p>\n<p>If you have any problems, or want to make a suggestion for the game, then feel free to leave a comment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T06:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8897abd5b38eacb6a6871715a0e98c14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TundrumMax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
