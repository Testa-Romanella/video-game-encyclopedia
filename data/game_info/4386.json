{"id": 4386, "slug": "saints-row-the-third", "name": "Saints Row: The Third", "name_original": "Saints Row: The Third", "description": "<p>Welcome to Steelport, a city that\u2019s been torn by the three violent gangs. And seemingly, only another violent gang can stop them. After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they\u2019re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. <br />\nWhile being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2011-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T15:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d69/d69810315bd7e226ea2d21f9156af629.jpg", "website": "https://saintsrow.com/", "rating": 3.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 287, "owned": 6902, "beaten": 2001, "toplay": 113, "dropped": 460, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 325, "ratings_count": 1985, "suggestions_count": 664, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 2000, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Volition"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["THQ"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
