Choose to draw a card OR play a piece each turn. Corruption 1 modifies how the pieces move, corruption 2 disables movement of the piece. Both corruptions last 3 turns.</p>\n<p>Buggy as hell, slightly unfinished. No AI so you have to play both players. Instructions in the title screens.\u00a0</p><p>The UI doesn't scale correctly across all computers (??)</p><p>Music made on an extremely fucked up circuit bent SK-1.
