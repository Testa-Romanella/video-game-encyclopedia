I\u00a0intended to develop a publicly released RPG engine, but then I\u00a0changed jobs and plans and my PV adventure soon ended. :)</p>\n\n<p>In Knight\u2019s Quest, you guide Sir Roland through Normannia in search of the Primal Evil Artifact. Your mission is basically to find this object. Your quest will take you through castles, forests and caverns. You will meet friendly people and fight evil creatures. You will also find several items, and some of them can be very useful for completing your mission. But above all, you will travel to a fantastic land only with a little help from your Pocket Viewer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a2946398d964397923694c2fdbf638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naranjito Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
