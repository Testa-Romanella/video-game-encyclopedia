But one lab has figured out a way to recreate human life from nothing except a previously-deceased person. This is a brilliant advancement, opening up many opportunities for studying the things yet unknown! With this discovery, they are hoping to improve communicative disease resistance and increase life expectancy. All good things, right?</p>\n<p>... Right? <br/></p>\n<p>Like all good things, once a sneaky government official hears of these developments, and gets involved, they ruin it. All it takes is one person with loose lips and a desire to capitalize on the idea of bringing your deceased loved ones back from the dead -- for a price -- before those secrets are no longer as \"classified\" as they once were, and people are clamoring for their recently departed to be given another chance at life. The experiment is still in early stages, and the scientists in charge have no idea what the long term effects of the resurrection process might be. <br/></p>\n<p>But nothing they imagined could even come <em>close</em> to the gruesome reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>While this early stage of <em>The Phoenix Project</em> should work with a controller, it has not been thoroughly tested. Proceed at your own risk, if you choose to play using one. <br/><br/>This proof of concept was created using RPG Maker MV between the dates of 30 June and 04 August for the IGMC 2022 Contest, intended to fit the theme: <em>Rebirth, Rejuvenation, and Resurrection.</em></p>\n\n<p>Follow me on twitter to keep up (@theoryoferin). Or, to get involved in the development of my main JRPG project, <em>All the King's Men</em>, follow its dedicated Twitter (@AtKM_Game) or watch me create it live on Twitch (thegreatperhaps)!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T08:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/555dff305b878e306c33a045b734d02d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["erin foster"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
