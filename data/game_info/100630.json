With the player's ability to see both past and present simultaneously, the goal of the game was to challenge players to think outside the box in regards to moving around the house and navigation obstacles in their path, rewarding those who act on curiosity. </p><p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p><p>- The game is meant to be played at the resolution of 1920x1080p. </p><p>-The current build available is designed to be played with a computer and xbox controller.
