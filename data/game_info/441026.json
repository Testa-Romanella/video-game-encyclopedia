You play as the leader of a special operations team on a covert operation, and are forced to make the choices that will effect the outcome of the operation. There is also no going back, so think carefully and do what you think is best.\u00a0There is no audio or visual component, merely the text elements. This project was made as a sort of response to the unwillingness of most war games to have you make difficult decisions and face the reality of what it is to fight a war.\u00a0I really hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:20:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cd9e0346e98e903b4ded7da5b6a2ea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jtrigsby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
