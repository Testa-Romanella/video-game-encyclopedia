This is a demo prototype for a high speed anti-gravity racing game. Inspired by titles such as F-Zero and Wipeout. Because this is a prototype there is only time attack mode and two tracks to race on.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I'm still a new Unity developer so there may be some bugs in this project but it mostly runs smoothly. As I get better at development and build my skills up, I will work more on this project to flesh out a full game. If any Unity devs out there enjoy this project and want to collaborate in the future, you can contact me via email here: dustsoft@gmail.com<br/><br/><br/><br/>For now I'll be moving on to another project so I can learn more and get better at development. Thanks again for playing this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T20:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59ec52c9aeef743443595eca4d746c1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["\u00c6on Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
