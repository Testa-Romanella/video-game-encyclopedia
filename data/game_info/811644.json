As time passed, Death felt the amount of working hours in her body, so she hired an intern to do her job while she could go on vacation.</p>\n<p><em>- Characters:</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Intern:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nHe is one of the many interns that the boss has at her disposal. While rather clumsy, the intern will be the main character in charge of the hat shop. He is overwhelmed by the workload ahead. Besides, he doesn't quite know what he has to do or how, but he will have to learn as he goes if he doesn't want his boss to replace him. He was considered shy, disorganized and very awkward by his classmates at the underworld raven school. Nevertheless, he puts his heart and soul into making the hats they entrust to him in order to please his ghostly customers, and especially his beloved boss.</p>\n<p><strong>Lady Death:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nShe is the owner of the hat shop, and employs interns to manage her businesses while she enjoys a long and well-deserved vacation. As she doesn't trust the protagonist very much, she will be keeping an eye on him through the painting of herself in the store, through which she will give him orders, so that he doesn't drive the business into bankruptcy.</p>\n<p><strong>Customers:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nThey are wandering ghosts who seek the perfect hat, because with these they can meet with their loved ones down on earth for a limited time, so you must be attentive to their requests. Of course, like any of us they have other things to do, so they will decide to leave if you do not attend to them before they run out of patience, so you better hurry and not anger the boss.</p>\n<p><strong>VIP's customers:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nThese are different from the rest because they have a narrative behind them that will make you connect with them.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>- Enemies</strong>:</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Puncher</strong>: This ghost appears in some rooms of the warehouse to bother you so that you can't make the hat. Its attack consists of pushing you to make you fall down and thus lose time.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>- The Store:</em>\n</p>\n<p>The store turns out to be very cozy, bright and spacious, although somewhat cluttered due to the personality of the protagonist. In this area you will find customers milling around while waiting for you to make the hat they so desperately need. In addition, you will find the portrait of Lady Death, with whom you can talk at all times, and to which the protagonist has built a kind of altar to worship her.</p>\n<p>Finally, behind the counter we find the back room, or work area, where you will have to create the hats using the requested ingredients and the different crafting tables.</p>\n<p><em>- Enchanted Warehouse:\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Your customers and business are not like any other, the warehouse will be no less. It is a living entity, a place used by Lady Death to obtain the materials for the hats. You can access through the door, or rather the mouth, which is located in the back room, but before entering you must present the notes of the orders that you have received, since the warehouse will be able to generate the ingredients needed to create the hats.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Once you access the warehouse you will realize that it is an old and deteriorated place, as well as quite dangerous, with floors that are destroyed when you step on them, pieces of the ceiling that will hang over your head or roads where you can hardly stand on your feet. The most important thing is that by being alive, it does not stop moving, so every time you enter the warehouse it will completely change the location of the rooms.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><em>- Mechanics:</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Scythe:<br/></strong>\r\nLady Death has prepared a gift for you inside the warehouse, it is nothing less than a replica of her own scythe with the same magical power. This scythe can be thrown to obtain distant ingredients that can not be reached in other ways or to throw them against orbs, which activate platforms that will help you advance through the warehouse.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dash:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to the scythe, Lady Death has decided to give you a little help to avoid the dangers of the warehouse, so she will grant you the Dash power, with which you will be able to jump over cliffs and longer distances inside the warehouse.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Teleporting:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nThe last of the aids he will give you is the power to teleport, this will be very useful to return to the beginning of the store once you have collected all the ingredients or to reorient yourself in case you get lost.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nCustomers will ask you to create hats based on three different ingredients; Material, Color and Ornament. Once you have collected the ingredients in the warehouse, it's time to start making the hats using the 4 crafting tables located in the back room.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Molder</strong>: In this table the selected material is introduced to give a certain shape to the hat.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Cauldron</strong>: In it you can mix the primary colors found in the warehouse to produce secondary colors.\r\n</li><li><strong>Transmuter</strong>: Here you will enter the ornament they have requested and a primary color for that ornament. For example,\u00a0 a red flower, you would enter the flower as the ornament and the red color as the primary color, thus obtaining the final ornament.\r\n</li><li><strong>Maker</strong>: Once you have everything ready, it is time to assemble the hat on this table. You will have to introduce the shape, obtained from the material, the color, obtained from the mixture, and the finished ornament. Once the right hat is created you can give it to the customer and they will leave.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Scroll</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since there will be many customers coming to the store and each one will want a different hat, you can use your trusty scroll which will automatically write down your orders while listening to what your customers want. </p>\n<p><em>- Controls:</em>\n</p>\n<p>We recommend you to play with a controller.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Xbox Control</strong>MoveWASDLeft JoystickInteractEAThrow ScytheLYDashSpaceRBTeleportingOLBOpen/Close ScrollPX\r\n<p>You can take a look at the controls again in the pause menu.</p>\n<p><em>- Linktree</em>\n</p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/22studiogames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fdee0bec4138dd29a2f9cacd78b4fdfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["22 Studio Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
