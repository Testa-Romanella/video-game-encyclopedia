{"id": 4527, "slug": "modern-warfare-2", "name": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2", "name_original": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2", "description": "<p>Continuation of the sensational first-person shooter from Infinity Ward and Activision. It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year, but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.</p>\n<p>The game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage, the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. </p>\n<p>If there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.</p>\n<p>As in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2009-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9af/9af24c1886e2c7b52a4a2c65aa874638.jpg", "website": "http://modernwarfare2.infinityward.com/", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 4229, "beaten": 2539, "toplay": 96, "dropped": 198, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 22, "achievements_count": 151, "ratings_count": 1951, "suggestions_count": 638, "game_series_count": 29, "reviews_count": 1960, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3", "macOS", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Infinity Ward"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Activison"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
