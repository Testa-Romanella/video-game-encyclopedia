This\u00a0gives maximum firepower but absorbing more energy may result in it exploding, it is impossible to tell how much more energy the orb can absorb in its critical state, but it wont be much.\u00a0 You can fire the orb and it will fly forward and detonate when it hits an enemy or reaches its maximum distance. This will discharge all of it's stored energy though, and you will have to recharge by absorbing more enemy fire.</p>\n<p>The orb will destroy your ship if it detonates too close to it.</p>\n<p>To progress to the next dimension you must destroy the guardian. <strong>You can only damage the guardian when in critical state.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Dimension increase with difficulty as you progress.<br/></p>\n<p>Sound assets from Kenny's free Sci Fi pack (some modified):\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/sci-fi-sounds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db0c1baa8ab1b2bef5d1282d6ba34daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ChrisBCK"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
