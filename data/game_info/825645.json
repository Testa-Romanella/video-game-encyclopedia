Do not use the shop.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to MiniFig Adventure!</strong></p>\n<p>You were midway through planning a session of your D&amp;D campaign when you were magically shrunk down and fell onto the game table. Now you have to adventure through the world map, fighting off the animated dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you defeat enemies, they\u2019ll drop Dice Fragments. When you gather enough Fragments, you\u2019ll be granted one of your Loaded Dice, which you can roll from the Pause menu. Your Loaded Dice start off with sides that slightly increase your attack damage or restore a little bit of health, but you can change that! You\u2019re the DM after all.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gather coins as you adventure to purchase custom dice sides that can allow you to do more damage or take more hits in battle. From the Pause menu you can access the Dice Shop to see what\u2019s for sale and buy new sides for your Loaded Dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>Reach the end of the levels to return home safely!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A and S\u00a0to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>W to enter end gate</li><li>Mouse to aim, click to attack</li><li>Tab to pause (access shop or roll your dice)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Debug controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>N - gain 1 dice Fragment</li><li>R - roll your dice</li><li>Backspace - reset level</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Attempting to buy items from the shop crashes the game.</li><li>You can't increase max hp.</li><li>The second level is empty, no game over screen.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The player's resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T07:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24e19e81b3e6e816495eab7a5751ab9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sam and Clay Records"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
