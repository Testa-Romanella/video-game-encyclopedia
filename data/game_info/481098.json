The jam lasted three days and had the theme <strong>MEMORY</strong>.</p>\r\nThe Idea Behind Yaang\r\n<p>Yaang is supposed to be a straight to the point memory game. He is a boy trying to get out of a magical cavern. To do that, the player must remember the path the cavern shows them.</p>\r\nImplementation\r\n<p>I pretty much only stopped to eat, exercise and sleep. The rest of the time was coding and looking at youtube shader videos. It was pretty awesome tho. Really loved the game.</p>\r\nFuture Ideas\r\n<p>Here are some ideas I had if I ever came back to this project:</p>\n<p>1 - Add an endless random mode.</p>\n<p>2 - Add many, many more levels, types of platforms and player abilities. For instance, a platform that changes position in the dark, or an ability that lets the player to see the destination for some period of time.</p>\n<p>\u00a03 - Port the game to mobile.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This section is dedicated to feedback.</p>\n<p>2 - The camera behaves a little strange at times.<br/></p>\n<p>Version 1.0 Is the version of the jam, but version 1.0.2 just improves the camera a little bit.</p>\n<p>Update: Version 1.0.2 no longer has these problems.</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Links\r\n<p>Programmer: Me https://dans1997.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Game Design:\u00a0 Me &amp; Fr00g\u00a0(https://fr000g.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Art: Herocrife (https://herocrife.itch.io/) &amp; Kiwizitos (https://itch.io/profile/kiwizitos)</p>\n<p>Sound Effects:\u00a0https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sfMaker/</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0 Hew Wagner -&gt;\u00a0@hewwagner\u00a0or\u00a0www.hewwagner.com</p>\n<p>Github of the project:\u00a0https://github.com/Dans1997/Yaang</p>\n<p>Link of the jam:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/jamingtons9</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fb9b638f5d2dfc940cc2a437119701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Danillo Neves"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
