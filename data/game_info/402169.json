{"id": 402169, "slug": "fliq", "name": "fliQ", "name_original": "fliQ", "description": "<p>A unique minimalist puzzle game, fliQ. Purpose of the game is to flip the pieces and make them in the right order and rotation according to given rule in a limited number of moves. Be careful about colors and rotation of the pieces and have fun.</p>\n<p>Currently there are 15 levels in the game, I have a lot more interesting levels in mind. If you like the first 15 levels please leave a comment so I can increase the number and\u00a0\u00a0complexity of the levels.</p>\n<p><strong>I came up with the idea for\u00a0 fliQ in Bioinformatics class while studying genetic sequencing\u00a0back in my university days. I took what we were doing on paper for genetic sequencing and made it simpler and more colorful.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This is a game I made for fun during my spare time. I plan to release one\u00a0game from different genres every month. Please follow me if you'd like to see more projects in the future.</em></p>\n<p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c58f497dea6bbdda8e2ec19849c2c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The MSO"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
