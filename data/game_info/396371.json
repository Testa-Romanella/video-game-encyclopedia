Otherwise the game is simple and fun to play as the tech demo it is.</p>\n<p>If you've got a couple friends, please feel free to download and play a few lives with them, or maybe open a few instances on the same machine to play using localhost!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95eb6ae7f2d93b169ff704e085b5cabe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erick Watson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
