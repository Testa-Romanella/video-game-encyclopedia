Because You'll die!<br/></p>\n<p>The theme for this Jam was merge, so here is the catch: you control 2 character in 2 different map, but by pression X or NumPad0 You can merge both maps to have more space to move, but that also means twice more lasers!\u00a0</p>\n<p>BIG BIG THANKS to Early Garden for the music! Check his sound cloud :<br/></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/earlygarden<br/></p>\n\n<p>Have fun! Be careful, this is goin' to be hard!<br/></p><p>PS: apparently Music is stopping on the browser version, I don't know why...
