Chris did the awesome art, writing, and music. I did the 3d modeling and programming. I really had fun working with someone else for the first time. The time limit made use really work hard to complete something. I hope to spend a couple more weeks to really bring this game to life and polish a lot more. Right now you can technically beat the game but it is missing quite a lot of cutscenes.</p><p>You can only get the false ending after 2 minutes pass. True ending is not in the game yet. Time is linear, stop overscoping your games for game jams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbbcf3747735219aef9cc8b1a647ee1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mitch Maki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
