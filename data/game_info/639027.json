Once it's up to speed, hold the spin button \"X\" to keep its momentum as you mow down enemies. The ball will speed up as you spin it, but it will lose speed when hitting enemies\u00a0so make sure to re-spin it if it gets to slow.\u00a0 You can also throw the ball with the throw button \"Z\" to hurl it at enemies from afar, and press either \"X\" or \"Z\" to bring it back in.\u00a0Hitting the walls with enough force can cause it to weaken and eventually break.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: player follows the cursor</p>\n<p>Spin ball: hold \"X\"</p>\n<p>Throw ball: hold \"Z\", aim and release</p>\n\n<p>*If the button controls aren't working, click on the game once</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:41:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aobatake1515"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
