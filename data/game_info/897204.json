While initially nothing more than an unsavory means of wasting time, the more competitive of the group take the activity to its logical limit, assaulting every passerby they encounter with a juvenile combination of loose paper, saliva, and malice.\r\nThis is the story of how this activity ends up going horribly wrong. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was created as an entry for the 7DFPS game jam. It was my first foray into anything even resembling 3D game design, so it is both extremely scuffed and heavily reliant on code from YouTube tutorials. It is also comprised almost entirely of assets reused from previous games I've worked on, which only adds to the aforementioned scuffed nature of the final product. Despite all of that, though, it was a very fun and enlightening experience to make, so I hope that you enjoy it for what it is, no matter how odd that state of being may be. Thank you as always for playing, and please be sure to check out the rest of the jam's entrants!</p>\n<p>Music by Mr. Smith, licensed under CC BY 4.0:</p>\n<ul><li>Rat Rod</li><li>AB-CD</li><li>Catch and Release</li><li>Hit That High</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/369eb35cc43bdae0a8bbf12bd108e236.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
