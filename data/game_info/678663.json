A recruiter from \u201cRedemption\u201d came to me right after the trial and offered me a simple choice \u2014 either I go to jail or exorcise the Dark Forces around the world. I chose the second option... I didn&#39;t know then what dangers I would face. Terrible monsters come from cursed places. But that&#39;s not all. Dangerous cultists rush there in an attempt to gain strength and make Satan come faster. And they don&#39;t give us a damn weapon. And how are we supposed to beat them?<br />\nGAMEPLAY<br />\nVisit cursed places around the world with your friends. Each place is a unique quest with several endings. Destroy the cultists and avoid monsters. You will have puzzles, hide-and-seek, and various outfits.<br />\nEARLY ACCESS<br />\nNow there is only one cursed place in Occult.
