Use the scroll bars to find the full screen button on the bottom right of the game frame.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s the Dia de los Muertos, and the spirits are restless! As a charter pilot for the dead, fly departed souls to exotic locations, helping them take care of unfinished business and achieve eternal rest. Pick up passengers with supportive abilities and matching traits that will unlock each other's final destinations. Plan efficient flight paths and board the right combo of souls, to score the most completed quests in a race against time. Take your passengers on the adventure of their afterlives!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play<br/></strong>Score points by delivering passengers to their final destinations. Each passenger possesses one or more supportive traits, depicted as symbols:\u00a0Resilience (cactus), Luck (dice), Compassion (flower), Music (guitar),\u00a0Illumination (candle), Ingenuity (tools), Courage (heart), and Faith (cross). <br/>If your plane reaches the destination written on a passenger's card, and other passengers aboard have\u00a0the traits it needs to complete its unfinished business, it can disembark - you supported them through this stage of their journey, now they can\u00a0continue on with their afterlife.\u00a0<br/>Each turn, you travel to a new destination, disembark any passengers whose requirements have been met, and board a new passenger. The game is over when you run out of turns.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Use WASD/Arrow keys to pan the camera around the map, and the Spacebar to zoom out or in. Click on a location to travel to it.<br/>Click on a card at your current location to board that passenger onto your plane.\u00a0(You can click on cards at other locations to view them larger.)<br/>When\u00a0a card aboard your plane is dancing, you can click on it to disembark it at that location (to\u00a0score points.) If you do not yet wish to disembark that passenger, you can click the \"Skip\" button instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips</strong><br/>- The longer a passenger has been on your plane, the more points you\u00a0will receive when it disembarks\u00a0(# of cards to its right +1).\u00a0<br/>- You must board a new passenger\u00a0at every destination. If your plane is full, the\u00a0passenger who has been with you the longest will be discarded as a lost soul (no points scored), to make room for the newcomer.\u00a0<br/>- When you have all the traits aboard your plane that a passenger needs to disembark, a stamp will appear on that card to let you know it's ready to go to its destination.\u00a0<br/>- Some passengers have special abilities, such as granting you extra turns or bonus points when they disembark.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T11:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a159625e254c74b4ba11b5b9731218a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hadiDanial", "polygonpros"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
