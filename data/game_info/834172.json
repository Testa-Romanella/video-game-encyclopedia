It's not a horror game!!!</em></p>\n<p><em>This game is still in development but this is a (nearly) full featured version.</em></p>\r\nIntro\r\n<p>Let me introduce to you: Eva, who looks like a\u00a0capsule.<em>(To be honest i got that idea from Wall-E)\u00a0</em>She was a robot and she loves fruit <em>(I know it is weird - How\u00a0the hell\u00a0can\u00a0a robot EAT?!)</em>. One day, she fall into a rabbit hole <em>(Sorry about that, Lewis Carroll)</em>, and she found herself in a weird place <em>(of course it is! I mean, even a robot cannot see sky deep in the rabbit hole!)</em> . She saw a door high up on a platform. It looks very mystic. <em>(In the real life, REMEMBER NOT to follow the rabbit like Alice or Neo - and the most important: do not enter any unknown doors!)</em>\u00a0She decided to explore this place. <em>(TOTALLY BAD DECISION)</em></p>\n<p>So this game, is all about her adventure, just download it (OR, play in browser, which is coming soon), and have fun!</p>\r\nSome hint\r\n<p>Since it takes a long time to build the project on WebGL, the web version will be less frequently updated. Therefore, the game version in browser might be a little older than Download version.</p>\r\nSee What's New\r\n<strong>Version</strong><strong>New features (Trailer)</strong><strong>Status</strong>0.0Just an alpha varsion, to test the enviromentEstablished1.0 alpha1, Jump boost apple<br/>2, Speed up banana<br/>3, Electric doorEstablished1.0 betaUser UIReleased1.0.11, Three whole new levels<br/>2, Downsizing and EnlargingReleased1.0.1FFix known bugs.Released1.0.21, One more levels.<br/>2, Moving Platforms.Released1.0.31, Zero Gravity Toggle (maybe)<br/>2, Some more levels.Designing", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T10:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7b/f7b5f72b71d0ee5734e35793c2aa171c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Silence"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
