As with 2Xtreme, 3Xtreme contains skateboarding, skating, and cycling options to reach the goal before opponent players. Unlike 2Xtreme, however, 3Xtreme's characters are composed of polygons as opposed to sprites. Such a design choice was detrimental to the graphics, however, as the game experienced frequent slowdown when more than one player was on the screen. The game plays the exact same as the first two.</p>\n<p>Codes in the game allow the player to race as aliens and miniature cars, among other characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-02T02:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3a5/3a53cf73f14c26e4e48652e6a386dc25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["989 Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["989 Studios", "989 Sports"], "esrb_rating": null}
