One, two, or three games can be played at the same time in Yatzy Multi-Game Edition. First, decide how many simultaneous games to play. Then, if there is more than one player, decide who is going first.<br/><br/>The object of the game is simply to get the highest score you can from rolling five dice.<br/><br/>The game lasts for 13 rounds per game. You can play up to three simultaneous games in Yatzy Multi-Game Edition.<br/><br/>Each round, you roll the dice up to three times. In any roll, you can choose to keep some dice and re-roll others.<br/><br/>When you are out of rolls or if you are satisfied with your roll before rolling three times, score the roll in one of the thirteen categories.<br/><br/>By the end of the game, you must fill each category with either the score you obtain or a zero.<br/><br/>For three of a kind, you must have at least three of the same numbers on the dice. Four of a kind requires four of the same numbers. The total of all dice are counted.<br/><br/>A straight is a sequence of consecutive numbers. A small straight requires 4 dice and gives you thirty points while a large straight requires all five and gives you forty.<br/><br/>A full house is accomplished by getting two of one number and three of a different number. A full house gives you twenty-five points.<br/><br/>A Yatzy is five of a kind and gives you fifty points for the first Yatzy and one hundred points for each additional Yatzy in the same game column.<br/><br/>The second Yatzy must be put in the upper score box for the number you rolled if available (i.e. five 5\u2019s would score twenty-five in the fives box and an additional one hundred points in the Yatzy bonus).<br/><br/>If the upper score box for the number you rolled is filled, you may place the score in any available box in the bottom section or place a zero in one of the boxes in the upper section.<br/><br/>Most players choose to put all Yatzys in the same game column and zero out the others. This will give you the highest maximum Yatzy bonuses.<br/><br/>Chance is a catch-all and you may use it to place any score that you don\u2019t want to place anywhere else. Use your chance box wisely.<br/><br/>Above all, have fun as you play Yatzy Multi-Game Edition!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c38ecd6c6ff31622ecfa1d72afe7076_ayri1Km.jpg", "website": "http://yatzymultigame.sitesculptors.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Site Sculptors"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Site Sculptors"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
