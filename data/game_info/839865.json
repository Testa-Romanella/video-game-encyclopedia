WHAT?</p><p>This is my submission for the Kenney Jam 2022. The theme was <strong>GROWTH</strong>.</p><p>Your <strong>goal </strong>is to <strong>make\u00a0grow the three\u00a0mushrooms until they reach (or surpass) the line</strong> in the middle of the screen <strong>together</strong>. To achieve this, you can <strong>fly around</strong> and\u00a0<strong>shout different commands to the creatures</strong>.</p><p>These are your <strong>controls</strong>:</p><p>Ok, but <strong>what the commands do</strong>?</p><p><strong>\"S\" command</strong> sends the creature to <strong>S</strong>LEEP for 5 seconds.<br/><strong>\"D\" command</strong> makes the creature perfom a fancy <strong>D</strong>ASH to run or avoid mushrooms.<br/><strong>\"F\" command</strong> <strong>F</strong>LIPS the creature.</p><p>Let's see them in action...</p><p>What happens <strong>when a creature collide with a mushroom of its same color</strong>? Easy: the mushroom grows and the creature flips. It's the only way the mushrooms can grow.<br/></p><p>What happens then <strong>when a creature and a mushroom of different colors collide</strong>? The mushroom shrinks, the creature changes its color to the color of the mushroom and flips. It could seem a bad thing, but sometimes you will need to change the color of a creature in spite of the mushroom shrinking.</p><p>You have <strong>5 minutes</strong> to exceed the line with ALL mushrooms at the same time. The remaining time is\u00a0your score.</p><p>And that's all! Please enjoy.</p><p>All art, sound FX and fonts\u00a0from\u00a0Kenney! :)<br/>Design\u00a0and programming by\u00a0David (@drnlab).<br/>Music from here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0c7800b049a3d0c55432afcc588dd99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
