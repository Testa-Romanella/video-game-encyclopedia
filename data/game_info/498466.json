The controls are Left-Click (doesn't currently work on itch.io) to delete drawn shapes by hovering over them and Right-Click in order to draw shapes (both buttons can be held in order to increase the amount of time the effect is active). There is a dropdown menu that controls what shape is currently being drawn and three color sliders that can be set in order to add that color to the current pool of colors being drawn with. There is also a timed delete button that will delete anything that is drawn after it is enabled after 3 seconds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/adddb92010631f3b165a08a3a5f3eff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jck38"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
