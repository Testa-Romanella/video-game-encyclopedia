Your goal is to prevent enemies from reaching the ground level by destroying them with cannon bullets as well as protecting civilians nearby and staying alive with an impenetrable barrier which can blocks bullet from both side include your cannon bullet, therefore if the shield if up you can\u2019t really shoot either but will be completely safe underneath. First goal is to destroy all enemies, second goal is to gain as much score as possible. Having civilians killed won\u2019t lose the game but means losing a lot of points in total.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T08:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43ebe2a13089c044a4ae10ed52648451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lqd456"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
