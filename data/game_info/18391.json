It works by rendering the 3D scene an X percentage higher than the physical resolution of the display and then resizing/downsampling the image back to your display. This results in an expensive form of high quality anti-aliasing that delivers a cleaner looking rendered image.<br/> <br/>You can fine tune super sampling settings in real-time.Introducing Super Enhanced ModeSimple VR Video Player is excited to introduce Super Enhanced Mode! Sharpen your video and drastically improve image fidelity by enabling &amp;quot;Super Enhance&amp;quot; in the options. The Super Enhance technique utilizes an intelligent sharpening algorithm to enhance contrast and details while maintaining image quality.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>This feature when combined with high Super Sampling effectively upscales, sharpens, and downscales the video for greatly improved clarity especially on virtual reality headsets.Multiple Video Decoding OptionsSupports Microsoft Media Foundation, DirectShow, LibVLC, and PopMovie for multiple video decoding solutions.What Can It Play?Simple VR Video Player was built to take advantage of multiple video decoding engines in the backend to offer the greatest compatibility.  As a general rule of thumb, if your Windows Media Player can play the movie, so can Simple VR Video Player.<br/><br/>Media Foundation (Win 8/10) is a super optimized DX11 hardware accelerated decoder built into the latest versions of Windows with full h264 decoding support.<br/><br/>For more advanced users, you can change the video decoding engine to use another video backend such as DirectShow which allows you to use DirectShow decoders, filters, and splitters such as LAV and ffdshow.  Just choose the best decoding option for you!<br/><br/>* Note: The player can't play Blu-ray discs since they are DRM'd and encrypted!It's Simple!We wanted to create the first simple and easy to use VR video player to take advantage of the Vive and it's hand motion controls.  We also wanted to make it powerful and customizable using familiar controls.  No other video player for the Vive compares to Simple VR Video Player for its simplicity and ease of use.More InfoFor more detailed information on features, go here:  http://simplevr.pro/videoplayer/docs<br/><br/>* Thanks to to the Blender Foundation's Big Buck Bunny and Tears of Steel for their open source films used in our videos and screenshots.
