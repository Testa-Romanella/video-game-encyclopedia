First game jam for me was a cool experience, used blueprints to be faster (a lot of spaghetti nodes too).<br/><br/>Made only 2 levels cause didn't have time to test everything, probably had to make more feedbacks about the machines and to make the player understand better in which state he is. I have done another machine too but didn't have time to make level 3. <br/><br/>Here should be that at some point there are a lot of packages going around the scene (didn't performances with a really a lot of packages)<br/><br/>- Used the cube in the first person puzzle template done by Divivor from the ue4 marketplace, just deformed to create all the other components too</p>\n<p>- Music and sounds from freesounds.com and Wowie resources that you can find here on itch.io for free (they are kinda random sounds, and probably missed somes feedbacks there too)</p>\n<p>- I did the game mechanics and logic, made in mostly 1 and half day. I choosed a minimalistic style cause i like simple things.<br/><br/>I thank everyone who will give me a feedback about the game.<br/><br/>See you at the next game jam! (maybe? haha)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06e0c7716c7189332490b0e581e442f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deolink"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
