He's a scientific experiment left unguarded who decided to flee back to his natural habitat, and found himself crossing a giant metropolitan city. Unfortunately, he wasn't welcomed in the warmest way: the citizens, terrified by his massive size and blazing colour, started screaming for help to drive away or even KILL THE MONSTER. Poor Monstie didn't understand the reason for such hatred. But he could do nothing but run, as he saw a crowd starting to form around him. In an attempt to save his life, through many obstacles and the environmental pollution, the misunderstood monster will take advantage of his amphibious nature, which allows him to walk the earth and swim through waters, to find his way to freedom. Will you help our giant puppy save his life</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>2d Art: <strong>Daniele Basilico, Riccardo Cavalli, Claudia Rast</strong></li><li>Programming: <strong>Paolo Ginefra</strong></li><li>Music and SFX:\u00a0<strong>Massimiliano Vizzini</strong></li><li>Game Designer:\u00a0<strong>Sharon Cavallari</strong></li><li>Game Director:\u00a0<strong>Eric Sorrentino</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/789/7898ddbdbf19a3513cf4519e9834aa0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PaoloGinefra"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
