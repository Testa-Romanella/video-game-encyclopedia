See if you can beat your high score.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>RoboBall uses a unique control system similar to golf games, where you can drag the mouse back and slingshot yourself through the air. It also has a combat system where you can only hurt enemies when you're at or above a certain speed. This will be indicated by your trail turning red.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>The gameplay, art, and music are all made by me.
