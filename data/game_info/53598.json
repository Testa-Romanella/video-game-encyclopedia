It was released by Nintendo in Japan in 2001 on the Game Boy Advance, then later released by Atlus in North America in 2002.<br />\nLike Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, The Knight of Lodis features party-based tactical combat on an isometric playing field. The player has limited control outside of battle, being provided only extremely limited movement on a world map, a shop function, an options menu, and an option to participate in a training session in which the player pits its own forces against each other in order to gain experience. Characters can be hired or acquired in combat, and there are interchangeable classes and a wide array of weapons, equipment and magic spells.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2001-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T08:49:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/600/6001cace6c05e9af22fbdac6e337dad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 6, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Quest"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
