It also reads users mouse location as shown on the top left. It spawns 3D cylinders from users' right click and destroys them after a set time. The user can change the color based on the RGB sliders or the dropdown menu which has a set color of red, green, or blue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/66498c39e5f4566e747995146859f46f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iag8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
