What should have been a short-lived indoor camping adventure, however, turns into a hellish nightmare when something begins hunting them down one-by-one.</p>\n<p>The house is not what it seems, and memories from the boys\u2019 past could be the key to everything\u2026 if they can only make it through the night.</p>\n<ul><li>Search for clues to reveal the truth!</li><li>Three different endings depending on how much of the story you uncover\u2014can you unlock the\u00a0<em><strong>true</strong>\u00a0</em>ending?</li></ul>\n\n<p>Easter is a independently-published horror adventure game developed using the RPG Maker VX Ace software. It\u2019s recommended for\u00a0<strong>mature audiences only\u00a0</strong>on account of:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Strong</strong><strong>\u00a0language</strong></li><li><strong>Disturbing, thematic elements</strong></li><li><strong>Pixelated gore</strong></li><li><strong>Sexual violence</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This game goes to some pretty dark places.\u00a0Please keep this in mind when deciding whether to play our game. It's definitely not for the young and the squeamish.</p>\n<p>Need some help finding all the endings? Check out this hint-based guide!</p>\n<p>The first game from Carrot Patch Games! We hope you like our short little horror game. Though the game has gone through some internal and external testing, there's always the chance for more bugs to pop up after a public release, so please write to us with any errors (or quirky oddities) you encounter in the game, and we'll get to them ASAP!</p>\n<p>[05.06.18 Update] Fixed two bugs that occurred under specific conditions in the true ending track. Not sure how many people may have experienced them, but this should keep them from ever happening again! Thanks as always for all your support for the game :)</p><p>[12.05.18 Update] A few more bug fixes and small tweaks. Fixed a strange bug that only occurred if you tried to walk out a door at the exact same time as the killer appeared, updated some visual and timing issues that had been bothering me, and added a new save before the attic.\u00a0 As always, let me know if you run into anything else!</p>\n<p>[30.04.18 Update] Uploaded new 1.0.6 version with a few small tweaks and various fixes. Mostly things only I would notice.\u00a0Also finally figured out how to edit\u00a0the Japanese that was showing up for saving/loading files and translated it to English.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a0ca19163bd7250bc6f323ff11e5e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["carrotpatchgames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
