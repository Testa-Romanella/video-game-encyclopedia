Commanding legions of vampires, hordes of demons and underlings, the world has been decimated several times over due to such recklessness. To prevent yet another devastating aftermath over simple <strong><em>disputes</em></strong>, the great leaders of the vampire clans formed an eternal agreement. All conflicts, be it rival or inter clans, would settle their dispute through competitive games. Games specifically picked and agreed upon by all parties involved prior to the day of battle. From Manchala to Cricket, many games have been played and changed, every era having its favourite. But in the ripe age of the 21st century, one game has stood out as the champion amongst favourites.</p>\n<p>This is Vampire Baseball.\r\n</p>\n<p>Vampire Baseball was made for\u00a0BIPOC Vamp Jam 2021.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since Vampire Baseball was inspired by that one scene in Twilight, half of the proceeds made will be going to the\u00a0Quileute Moveto Higher Ground Project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/327c5da50ce8c9e09eb7baa7cb6bfa4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jessie Lo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
