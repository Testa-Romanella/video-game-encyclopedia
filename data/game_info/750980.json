{"id": 750980, "slug": "the-ouchee-island-ramification", "name": "The Ouchee Island Ramification", "name_original": "The Ouchee Island Ramification", "description": "<p>As a member of the 1st World Nuremberg Code Enforcement Battalion you have been detached to a mission on an uncharted island, where internationally wanted war criminals, terrorists, mad\u00a0scientists and cleptocratic megalomaniacs have taken their last stand in order to escape Justice.</p>\n<p>Soldier, arrest and detain their leaders by any means necessary.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Cursor keys and mouse to steer, Left Mousebutton: fire. Space: jump.</p>\n<p>Please note: this is an early draft for an NPC handling code. This is not yet a full game, but you can already fight against the NPCs and get an idea about how playable such a system could be, given it is refined a bit more. This release is also a milestone in my fps case study for CopperCube, as, while still rudimentary and imperfect, it uses every feature required for a serious fps and therefor proofs CopperCube is indeed capable of producing fps etc. games for the WebGL target.</p>\n<p>I also add the CCB project for download, so you can see and use the scrips. The NPC system however loads a number of waypoint files that were recorded by a feature of the current version of fancy terrain generator that's not yet released, but the format is simple so you could make your own recorder easily. It's in test ascii format, each file consists of:</p>\n<p>number of waypoints</p>\n<p>path index\u00a0 (0 to number of NPCs)</p>\n<p>waypoint X</p>\n<p>Y</p>\n<p>Z</p>\n<p>Yaw angle</p>\n<p>timestamp\u00a0 (this is ignored so far)</p>\n<p>X</p>\n<p>Y</p>\n<p>Z</p>\n<p>Yaw</p>\n<p>timestamp</p>\n<p>X</p>\n<p>,,,,</p>\n\n<p>The recorder records the current player position once every second and makes it a waypoint. If the player is idle, the NPC will also be idle, except for when in attack/panic mode. However I'm looking forward to release the latest generator version ASAP, even tho, in order to be able to record tracks that can utilize meshes that were added in CopperCunbe to the terrain (eg. buildings), one should better\u00a0 implement the recorder in CopperCube, which seems too trivial. To adjust the walking speed, you may have to use a sampling frequency slightly higher or lower than 1 second, or you may alter the speed values for walk and run in the game script.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:04:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07c453be7887069508632924d1b1152a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfkEO1010etc"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
