We could not build it in time due to bug with tilemaps in Unity 2017.3.1f1. But it has the same functionality as a JAM version except we changed the controls from Z, C to A, D and very slightly modified the tutorial sequence. If you want to play JAM version, then head over to downloads.\r\n\n<p>We all had this moment while playing an rpg game.
