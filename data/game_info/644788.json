As Luna, travel to 5 exotic planets to track down your mutinous mates, and face them in Bullet Hell dogfights to the death!<br/><br/>Stop! Bullet Time<br/><br/>Outnumbered and outgunned, it's a good thing Luna has an ace up her sleeve: a space fighter craft that can alter the flow of time itself! Power up the Bullet Time gauge by destroying enemies or catching their attacks in a bomb blast, then enter Bullet Time! Enemies and their projectiles will move in slow motion, while you can still fly and shoot at normal speed.<br/><br/>Galactic Gold Rush<br/><br/>Why eat lead when you could turn lead into gold? During Bullet Time, the bullets from any enemies you destroy will be converted into gold cubes to collect! Will you play it safe and quickly cash in bullets for survival, or take a risk and allow bad guys to flood the screen with fire for a massive score boost?<br/><br/>Eye of the Tiger<br/><br/>Star Hunter DX is old school hard, but wants you to succeed: the extensive practice mode will help beginners to survive, and allow pros to perfect their runs. Push it to the limit and rise to the top of the leaderboards!<br/><br/>Super Streaming<br/><br/>Why stop at the top of the leaderboards, when you could show off your skills (or practice runs) live?
