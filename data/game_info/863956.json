There are 4 levels, 3 basic tutorials and 1 puzzle. I feel like with some work this could maybe become a fully realised puzzle game.</p>\n<p>I had some more ideas such as having humans to avoid and \"magnet traps\", things like that. I thought I'd mapped out my schedule quite well but, alas, it appears not as I barely managed to make all the submitted features in time (bugfixing took me over).<br/></p>\r\nBugs\r\n<p>Minimal bugs this time. Sometimes the angle goes weird on the boxes but you can either work with it or reset if it breaks the level.</p><p>The music on level 2 is louder than the rest of the game. :(<br/></p>\r\nFuture Development\r\n<ul><li>I'm not 100% happy with the sliding motion of the boxes. I feel a better version of the game would have the boxes stop when not being magnetised but then have \"slippery\" surfaces that allow for the movement that's currently in the game.</li><li>Better art would be nice...</li><li>More puzzles</li><li>I think a \"hard\" mode with human employees that you have to avoid could be interesting.</li><li>More complicated puzzles or an infinite mode where you have to record/set up robotic movements to fulfill a production line could be fun.</li><li>Maybe swap the polarity of the holes so that red boxes go to red holes. I feel it makes more logical sense the way I have it at the moment but I think swapping the colours on the holes might feel more intuitive.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\nGame Design/Programming\r\n<p>Derwent Ready<br/></p>\r\nSound Effects\r\n<p>Teifion Powell</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Magic Space by CodeManu - CC0 - https://opengameart.org/content/magic-space</p>\r\nFonts\r\n<p>Kenney</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>Derwent Ready</p>\n<p>Kenney<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T05:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/716/7160051d11736c1dac18427eccb206bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
