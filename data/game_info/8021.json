From level to level, through various dungeons and other places, you must find and activate the exit which leads to the next level.<br/><br/>Each dungeon needs a certain number of gold coins to reveal its exit. But beware: monsters, traps, logical puzzles and even an enemy with the same goal as yours will stand in your way.<br/><br/>You must get as much gold as you can and find the exit before the enemy does. With the remaining gold you can buy better weapons, armor, spells or potions in the shop which will always await you after you have completed a dungeon.<br/><br/>Gameplay video: youtube.com/users/RedshiftHU", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95fc59efbe4d4e7d5626af5e18141eda.jpeg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["RPG", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
