It was prompted by an anonymous letter saying \"Shooter In Style Starwars\".<br/><br/>This is the first time ive ever really made an action game by myself, and it's all thanks to that prompt, so please enjoy, and happy holidays!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Most of the sound effects and all of the music come from starwars of course! particularly the star wars SNES games, which were a big inspiration.\u00a0</li><li>It also uses a sound effect from Metal Gear Solid and a sound effect from Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and several others from the internet that are not star wars.</li><li>The codebase for this game was based on an old joint project with Austin Heller, and a lot of his movement and camera code survives in this version.\u00a0 Check out his games and music! The old version was a Nausicaa inspired game. It had all sorts of mechanics coded and planned, including dynamic trade ships and economies between cities, and a big event that would happen after enough time passes. It was too ambitious for us at the time but i'm glad I was able to use some of it, and finally give it a proper combat system. Maybe someday I'll come back to this engine for something else!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d5a713e181a496396347488c45af1ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnLee Cooper"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
