All spaces are empty and lifeless, although once they were inhabited, they were used, everything worked and developed. But now this is a shapeless and empty world of turned-off appliances and frozen mechanisms. What happened and why had everything stopped? Why is everything in darkness? Probably, it also should be found out.<br/></p>\n<p>MOSOLOV is a small game, a proof of concept, created by a small independent\u00a0team of developers (DIASURA Team). This is a kind of concept of visual style, atmosphere and a bit of gameplay of what we want to see in a full game.</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/groups/diasura.team<br/>https://www.instagram.com/diasura_team<br/>https://www.vk.com/diasura_team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c500b6ce7ccbeffb8fabfd8410c42a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HecyCBET"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
