A small project for GAM 355 by Justin Forkey.</p>\n<p>In this game you play as a blacksmith. Get materials and start crafting some weapons to sell to the populace. Work your way into investing in some local miners to get you a steady supply of materials. From there start recruiting the locals to come and learn under your guided wing. Watch them grow from simple Apprentices to experienced Journeyman (and women).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game stands as a \"prototype\" or technical demo of the idea behind Blacksmith Idle. Although it may not look very pretty it runs fairly well and with some more effort (and a decent team) this could become a decent clicker.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64fb9216601480752cf55370a24421db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alchemic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
