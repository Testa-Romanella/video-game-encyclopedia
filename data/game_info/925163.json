Someone would hide an object and then the people seeking to find the object, could get hints to know if they are close or far from the object. You would say \"cold\" when you are far from the object and \"hot\" when you are closer. My game, however, doesn't tell you if you are hotter or colder. But the rooms do get darker red and bright blue to help you follow along where you stand. Make sure you grab the gun when you are playing! Good luck.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T04:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a234d04cc81888f7ad63e4546b5c19f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["msf874"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
