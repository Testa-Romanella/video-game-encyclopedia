A hard-boiled\u00a0Merc who had renounced his violent past and a young noble seeking adventure, these unlikely friends will find their Candiff exam to be the least of their worries. The ruins in which they hunt contain more than just monsters. In a nation the human world thought destroyed, a revival is occurring. A revival blessed by Fate itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Moonrise Hope is a unique Tactics RPG built to reward creative, expressive\u00a0play with massive galaxy brain combos and powerful damage effects.

Characters can encourage each other to raise each others spirits and thus gain an edge in battle. However, if morale goes to low, cracks will start to show. Characters will exhibit their unique weakness, making a tough fight even more tense.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Action Point System\u00a0</strong>: Each party member has a unique set of abilities they use at the cost of Action Points. The number of possible move combinations combined with the built in synergies between the character's abilities leads to out-of-the-box solutions and massive combos.</li><li><strong>Stun System : </strong>Every time you deal HP damage to an enemy, you stun it for that turn. However, most enemies have armor, so dealing damage to enemies becomes an intense puzzle with a rewarding payoff.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Support the Project</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We would like to develop Moonrise Hope into a full Tactics RPG, but we need help!<br/>If you liked our game, consider sharing it with others!<br/>You can also join our discord or follow our social media platforms.<br/>Discord :\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/GKRQcqY</p>\n<p>Twitter :\u00a0https://twitter.com/Riverwolf_dev<br/>Instagram :\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/willfish_gamedev/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4de/4de07919d7e2f683c5d99e362d659638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UncleTroy", "Will Fish"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
