To win, collect a total of <strong>$347,137.30</strong>!<br/><br/>In Classic difficulty mode, if beavers walk straight towards the hole they'll stop and not fall in! The \"trick\" is to make sure you steer them towards the hole, but not directly at it: Always mind the angle at which beavers are walking towards the pit!<br/><br/>If you manage to make a beaver walk closely past the hole, it's a good chance to give them a little scare: Usually, they will jump right in!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With special thanks to the amazing <strong>Hbomberguy</strong>, <strong>Casey Explosion</strong>, <strong>Shaun</strong>, the<strong> The Skeleton Crew</strong>, and everyone who has donated time or money, to make the Mermaids stream the success it was!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T12:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33da0273590407491ecfab55a4bb899c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dare Looks", "DareLooks"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DareLooks"], "esrb_rating": null}
