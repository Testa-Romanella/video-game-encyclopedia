You enter the Holodaze arena armed with your power balls and your trusty teleporter to see how long you can survive. Teleport from cube to cube whilst destroying enemy robots and dodging their attacks.<br/><br/>Robot drones will randomly appear to try and blast you to pieces but you can fight back by throwing your power balls in their faces! <br/><br/>The one catch is, when you teleport, you can teleport to any face of the cube which shifts your orientation in the Holodaze arena so now when you throw, gravity is working against you. In easy mode and normal mode you have a helpful reminder of which cube face you're standing on. Green is the top of the cube, Red is the bottom of the cube, Blue is any of the sides of the cube..... Stay on the green to make your life easy!<br/><br/>If you're on the underneath of a cube, then throwing up is just throwing down!<br/><br/>Three levels of difficulty mean casual gamers can enjoy whilst hardcore addicts can try the hard mode for a real challenge.<br/><br/>There are also powerups to make your life easier. The red powerball can be shot like a laser (no need to throw that bad boy), the triple shot gives you three balls, and the confusion causes the robots to malfunction.<br/><br/>How long can you last in the Holodaze arena? <br/><br/>Get your throwing arm ready!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a60942a808bf984b6d1d4b2ecbb5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sysdia Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sysdia Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
