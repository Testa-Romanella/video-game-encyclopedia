As this is government the focus is on not doing any real work so instead of filing your own forms, you could just make sure the other team doesn\u2019t file any of theirs. Steal their forms, build barricades or simply resort to throwing random office equipment at them.</p>\n<p>This game is a game jam prototype, demonstrating SUGAR (http://sugarengine.org/) functionality within a local multiplayer context.</p>\n<p>The source code is available here: https://gitlab.com/playgen/sugar-jam/not-football</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac14d47d452af5d279e0a12172397b43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["PlayGen"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
