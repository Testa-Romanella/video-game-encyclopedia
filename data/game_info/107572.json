I've been working on it for years now and it's pretty much complete.</p><p>A game inspired by many classica RPGs such as Pokemon and Final Fantasy, delve into the engaging, yet satirical story; with around 10 hours of storyline gameplay and plenty of additional sidequests, minigames and post-completion content. You'll laugh, you'll rage, you'll jump out of your seat when you beat that boss you've been stuck on. All in all, you'll have a great time with this game.</p><p>Windows 7 and 10 only, unfortunately. Sorry, it's the nature of the language that it's written in.</p><p>I'm still improving &amp; tweaking the game so any feedback, critical or positive, will be very much appreciated. If you can think of any cool new features or anything that could be done better please let me know. I'm always open to new ideas!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8c865bc84a847f867736741abe8251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nicksisson"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
