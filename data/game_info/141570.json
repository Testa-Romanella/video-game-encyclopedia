It is a project that a single person developed to improve his skills. Do not expect \"next-gen\" graphics with an amazing story, though It's influenced to take a moment for sight-seeing. Oh, and unfortunately there isn't any Easter-eggs (not kidding).</p>\n<p>Psst, also contains some fairly bad music played on a Guitar because the developer has yet to invest into a Piano.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef3/ef307102cbc5b4a8e4a86b7bc57e0b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamernerd455"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
