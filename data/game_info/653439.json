The main idea is that after death a human soul does not depart immediately to find its next embodiment, but passes through a stage between lives. During this trip, a soul sees various illusions reproduced by the subconscious, meets both bad and good gods. The soul of the deceased person does not realise at once that it has left the physical world already. According to the plot of the game, the main character finds itself in a horrible and strange cemetery, where graves and buildings are covered with magic signs and evil graffiti. In this world the soul's body is almost naked, covered with spots and bruises. All the phenomena here is just a product of the soul's fears that it has experienced during it's lifetime. It is a place between worlds, reminiscent of purgatory. Main character is followed by a monster, if it will catch the main character, he or she will appear in a Hell Scene and will lose the game. To win, character has to find a grave with his or her name and jump inside, so the character will leave this world and appear in a Paradise Scene so, will win the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Game mechanics:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Third-person game with an ability to win or lose. At the very beginning, a player is offered a choice of 2 characters to play - a man and a woman. To start player have to indicate his/her name or nickname, that will later appear on a random grave. There is a portal between scenes (a passage to the scene of the Paradise). The game consists of three scenes: 1) the graveyard, where the player starts the game, 2) the heaven scene \u2014 the Paradise, 3) the hell scene. The game is made on the Unity engine, intended for display on a stand with a screen and a joystick. The stand can be decorated with artefacts inspired by plots from the game, printed on a 3D printer. All three models, characters and objects were created in programs such as Maya, Zbrush, 3D Coat, as well as the textures, which were created by hands using Substance Painter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/42553132501c6e3432b9b3c843417bc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Katya_Galitskaya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
