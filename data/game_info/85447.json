{"id": 85447, "slug": "pipe-trouble", "name": "Pipe Trouble", "name_original": "Pipe Trouble", "description": "PIPE TROUBLE takes a clever new spin on an arcade classic and puts players in the middle of Big Oil &amp; Gas. In this over-the-top satire you're tasked with building your own pipeline, and trying to balance the financial demands of using the least pipe to make the most money against the impact on the local environment and neighbouring farms. <br/><br/>On the right, a gas company rep keeps track of your budget and continually pushes you to create the most direct economical route - every piece of pipe costs money and every second counts.  Meanwhile, on the left a local farmer gauges your impact on the area and community.  Lay your pipe too close to the pastures and risk springing a leak that kills livestock or makes people sick.  Build through forest or near water and  incite protesters that block your path.  Suffer a leak or raise local indignation too far and risk potential pipe sabotage that could end your operation. <br/><br/>PIPE TROUBLE is a Pop Sandbox Production, produced in collaboration with Six Island Productions with the support of the Ontario Media Development Corporation and the Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund. It was developed with the support of docSHIFT (an initiative of the Documentary Organization of Canada's Toronto chapter).<br/><br/>NOW WITH UNIVERSAL DEVICE SUPPORT!<br/><br/>Note for iPad 1 &amp; iPod Touch:  We have had to reduce overall visual quality to support these devices.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2a68ffc21aabe2c272fb13036384b69.jpg", "website": "http://www.pipetrouble.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Pop Sandbox"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Pop Sandbox"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
