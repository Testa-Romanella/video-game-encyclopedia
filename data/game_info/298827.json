It is our first game with an actual mechanism of Win or Lose outcome. We've learned quite a lot in Unity and Game Design during those 48 hours!<br/></p>\n<p>We created everything from scratch (aside from the music, which is entirely Royalty Free and a few generic images from Google).</p>\n<p>We wanted to learn the nook and cranies of the mechanisms behind the Bullet Hell genre, and given the time we could allocate to this project, we are very proud of how it turned out.</p>\n\n<p>The game use random variables each runs, so do not expect to learn anything from memorising the pattern. We took extra time to make sure the game is beasable every runs - albeit very hard.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you're going to enjoy our little prototype!</p>\n<p>-Sincerely, 3 french people (we couldn't figure out of a team name yet). <br/></p>\n\n<p>PS: The idea to make the game crude in its graphics and language came on its own. We do not recomand to people that are easily offended.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T03:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fccfc85b2203066959b021a491004cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JulienGn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
