{"id": 815883, "slug": "tenta", "name": "Tenta", "name_original": "Tenta", "description": "<p>A dark atmospheric world where you are chased by an endlessly growing snake. Progress through the levels by picking up as many purple bottles as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the levels progress you will find it harder to continue, having to manage the snake's tail to not block yourself off.</p>\n<p>The beneficial potions that spawn alongside the purple bottles are the key to breaking through the higher levels.</p>\n<strong>Jump Potion:</strong> Unlocks the ability to jump over obstacles for a short time.<br/><strong>Restore Health:</strong> If you've taken damage, you'll need this to get back to full health.<strong>Stamina Potion:</strong> Grants the player unlimited stamina for a period of time.<strong>Potion of Snake Bane:</strong> Banishes the Snake from the level, clearing it's tail from your path.<strong>Skip Level:</strong> Will provide you with enough purple to proceed to the next level.\r\n\r\nThe Project:\r\n<p>Tenta is an exercise in picking a simple idea and executing on it. The thought came to me \"What would it be like if the enemy gradually blocked your path and created an emergent maze?\".</p>\n<p>The running after bottles is an excuse to get the player moving around to that end, but the real challenge is managing the snake in the higher levels so you can still reach key areas of the map.<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the mechanics are established after a day or two so now it's up to me to iterate on game play and polish.</p>\r\nYour Task:\r\n<p>I need you to download the game and play it for an hour or two. See how far you can progress. <br/></p>\n<p>Once you have a feel for it, let me know what you would do to make the experience more fun. Remembering that it's all centered around the snake.<br/></p>\r\nThe Future:\r\n<p>No plans really. Just see this to it's completion in order to create a small, self contained but compelling experience. It'll always be a free little game made just for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>Now go! Stop reading and play the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d2ae3b4a7720d76977bbc0cc38d1e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["omNomios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
