You may be tasked with manipulating physical structures, deal with waves of phasms or briskly bound through the aether. The puzzle is to deduce the limits of the room's mechanics which evolve as you progress. Some rooms focus on brain-melting logic, others rely on sharp reactions, but many more will test the limits of every facet of your cognitive faculties.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/>Please make sure your graphics card meets the minimum requirements. If you suffer a \"vertex buffer\" memory error then it's likely your graphics card may not quite be able to handle some of the game's graphical effects, in which case try setting the Decorations option lower.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de60de5d8112afb44fcd5176755f4d5f.jpg", "website": "http://caiysware.com/ilamentia", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 140, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Case"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Caiysware"], "esrb_rating": null}
