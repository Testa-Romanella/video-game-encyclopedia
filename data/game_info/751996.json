The user can select to play either to a certain score or for a certain amount of time. When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks. When on defense, you can try to take your rival&#39;s ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9da4bb5d2e06ad7f8e3c41122260d8f2.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/msdos_One-on-One_1984", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
