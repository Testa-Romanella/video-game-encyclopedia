The design constraint we chose for the game is that the player only uses one button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game you play as Icarus collecting letters for the Gods. Icarus will automatically run to the right and swap directions when hitting a wall. You control Icarus with the spacebar (or A/X/B on controllers) and can tap once to make him flap and jump upwards, or hold it down to glide. Each of these actions deplete your stamina meter, which can be refilled by collecting feathers. Use your stamina carefully to complete each level.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Phillips Albright - Programming, Level/World design</p>\n<p>Mitchell Dunning - Modeling and Animation, Design</p>\n<p>Kai Machuca - Music and Sound Effects</p>\n<p>Isaiah Che - Design, Programming</p>\n<p>Outside Assets used:</p>\n<p>Ancient Greece 3d Low Poly Asset Pack by aitordsgn</p>\n<p>Modified the Low Poly Human by graju</p>\n<p>Sounds sourced from BBC Sound Effects and Freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T04:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da521b068619d84310ca6fd35390bf61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Phillips Albright", "Chonibi", "swaggimus-grime", "kineticai"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
