It was really a lot of fun to make and I think I will use this tool more in the future... I will probably be making another game using this control style because I like the quick-turn, so stay tuned!<br/></p><p>CONTROLS:<br/>Up arrow = Thrust forward<br/>Left/Right arrow = Turn<br/>Down arrow = Quick-reverse/brake<br/>Spacebar = Fire<br/>R key = Reset game<br/><br/>New stuff spawns when you clear the screen of asteroids and enemies.
