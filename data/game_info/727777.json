As part of the defense, your job is to protect the convoy from dangerous objects and survive by recycling energy from space debris . How long will you last? <br/></p>\n\n<p>RubiSAT deals with the topic of space debris. The player sits in a space station and has to free the environment from scrap parts and comets with the help of tractor beams. The energy needed for the station has to be extracted from the debris.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>RubiSAT stands out from the competition with its unique controls. The space station consists of six rings that can be rotated independently of each other. A total of four beam projectors sit on top of the rings. These can be switched from one ring to the other using a mechanism similar to a Rubix Cube.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d68c9ae7a7177d0c041ee308d554faa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lotte", "Pinat53", "Jessica5"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
