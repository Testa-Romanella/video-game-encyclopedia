This game is based on the\u00a0Unity FPS microgame template. The main objective of this game is to kill all the enemies which in this case are space robots on mars. In game u might notice missing parts and holes in the walls, the reason is unknow and hope to fix it soon. This is only a prototype model of my game it only has one level due to the lack of time i had to engineer the game (1 week). During the building of the game i had issues with WebGL so unfortunately <strong>THIS GAME IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T06:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/941/94164516ce10c6864eb192eea368b030.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndeIntch"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
