{"id": 779277, "slug": "code-virus", "name": "CODE VIRUS", "name_original": "CODE VIRUS", "description": "<p>Collect mutation points and mutate your virus to create the deadliest virus the human race has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>CODE VIRUS is an Idle Clicker/Simulation hybrid. Select a starting continent, click your virus, and mutate it to begin infecting the continent - and eventually, the world!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Clicking the virus is the primary way to generate mutation points, which can be spent to mutate your virus.\u00a0There are several upgrades at your disposal to make your virus more powerful. Upgrading click power doubles the amount of mutation points you get with every click; passive income gives you a steady stream of mutation points, even while AFK; infectivity increases the rate the virus infects the general population; lethality increases the rate the virus kills the infected population; and resilience allows your virus to infect harsher biomes.</p>\n\n<p>I developed CODE VIRUS by myself\u00a0for my Senior\u00a0Capstone as a part of my Game\u00a0Design &amp; Development degree. This was a student project that I put together in just over four months. All assets and scripts\u00a0unless otherwise noted in the credits were created by me!</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<ul><li>Direction Buttons:<ul><li>https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/</li></ul></li><li>Skyboxes:<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-fr...</li></ul></li><li>Outline Shaders:<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-1154...</li></ul></li><li>Main\u00a0Title Font:<ul><li>https://www.dafont.com/neuropolitical.font</li></ul></li><li>UI Font:<ul><li>https://www.dafont.com/black-acute.font</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9cc7ccf969263393f7cbe77a776bc79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrimTheGoat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
