Try to create good quests to profit for gold. Mine rocks to get mines which you can use as a quest item. Give your quest a whatever name you want, choose which item you want knight to bring you, and which item will you give it to him. Will he accept the quest? Will he accept it if you give him low-tier item for an higher-tier? Unlock other islands to gain more Knights, and try to survive as many days as you can! You can die from hunger or from enemies spawned at night called \"Borbs\"!</p><p>Make sure to leave feedback!
