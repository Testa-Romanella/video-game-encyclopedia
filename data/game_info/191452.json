However, this is as far as this got in implementation (the Skill was to come from the use of currently incomplete flavorings, acting as a discount and even money-gaining method if abused cleverly).</li></ul>\n<p>Third-party resources in use:</p>\n<ul><li>Unreal Engine 4</li><li>Lots of UE4's starter/engine content for the 3D primitives, intro sky, font and UI animations, as well as the SFX (the new VR editor's got several great click sounds)</li><li>Music:\u00a0http://timotheyadam.com/AUD/</li></ul>\n<p>Basically, outside of the quick sprites, I was just focused on the design/code. I definitely learned a ton with this though, both as to where my personal tastes have developed since my last Ludum Dares back years ago (You Are the Villain and You Only Get One, I believe).</p>\n<p>Thanks for hosting/judging this jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fe298728cbadcc31f78efcf973922b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twila27"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
