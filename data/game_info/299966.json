I didn't know what to do exactly but then I played Ravenfield and I thought: 'You know? If this guy can do that with Unity so do I'. This <strong>doesn't mean that I'm gonna copy Ravenfield</strong>. My idea is to make an FPS kind of metal gear like where you have to kill many enemies to get to an objective.</p><p>But my main <strong>target is not to sell the game</strong> or to make a low-poly copy of Metal Gear. My target is to make a game I can enjoy myself, only for fun.\u00a0 And if some other people enjoy it as well, that's even better. I think I'll spend a lot of time on this game because I started two days ago and it was really fun. I'd also like to make it really community friendly, so if you have <strong>any idea you want to see added</strong> or just have some <strong>feedback</strong>, <strong>you can join my Discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Sv6aQCv\u00a0</strong>and tell me.</p><p>By the way I'm <strong>not </strong>gonna make it <strong>multiplayer</strong> sorry.</p><p><strong>The scene that is available on this version is a prototype only for playtesting. The controls are more or less the same that any shooter has. Try not to switch weapons while reloading. You can reload the scene by pressing Q.</strong></p><p>Content will be added every 2-5 days, stay tuned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T03:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/215b10610287f305310aa416111d0d03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Delthor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
