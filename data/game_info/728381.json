In a world where no one aware, she was its own king.\u00a0Thus she was able to be free from the slightest restraint. If she pleased, she could fly to every corner and crouch in any shadow where the sunlight reflected.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Unlike the darkness, the light was a whole unknown world to her, full of crises. she\u00a0never dared to step out from the shadows into the light, but to peek at the other side through the cleft between light and darkness.</p>\n<p>What about you?\u00a0Our poor little creature who is afraid of the darkness.\u00a0This journey is about you, but not just about you. It is a journey about you and your fears finding and accepting each other. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Game Designer: 42L, AI, KK\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist: AI, HALOes, PoP\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmer: 42L, S.D., Zora\r\n</p>\n<p>Composer: freefallyang\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game prototype was developed in 48 hours as 2021 \u00a0GGJ's \u00a0entry.\r\n</p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/hello-darkness-my-old-friend-4\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91f7f26b1e4715d9a42930197633b8e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["42L"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
