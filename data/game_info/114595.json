First off, sick. Second, all you have to do is open the door and shove him in!</p>\n<p>What does this have to do with Stupid to live? EVERYTHING.</p>\n<p>Stupid to live is a free puzzle game that uses your own intuition against you.</p>\n<p>You over complicate things, try to find the answers when they\u2019re right in front of you. Looking around the room for the cube that\u2019s in your hands. The answer to every puzzle isn\u2019t obvious because it\u2019s so obvious, that you think it\u2019s not the answer because no answer can be that obvious. Obviously. Stupid to live has 11 unique levels, and a ton of different mechanics,</p>\n<p>So the game never gets tiring, even after you\u2019ve been stuck on the same puzzle for over an hour.</p>\n<p>a custom soundtrack accompanies your journey as you make your way through every room, staircase, and hallway all full of hand drawn pixel art. A wacky story, and random moments of humor, make this game complete. The only part left missing is you.
