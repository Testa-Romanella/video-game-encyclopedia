We make colorful games here, and here we'll be showing Super\u00a0Major\u00a0Miner\u00a0 (or\u00a0Major\u00a0Miner\u00a0for\u00a0short).</p>\r\nMajor Miner Gameplay\r\n<p>In Major Miner, your goal is to collect enough treasure in the sack  (usually near the start). You stack treasure in your hands until you  can't carry anymore -- the blue meter on the right is your Weight Gauge.  Some treasure is hidden within ground, so you'll need to use your  pickaxe to uncover it. \u00a0Hidden treasure will gleam when approached.  There are also enemies to fight.\r\n </p>\n<p>Nothing is final, the game is still being developed. <br/></p>\r\nMajor Miner Features\r\n<p>- Full controller support -- with button mapping options</p>\n<p>- 2-player Co-op<br/></p>\n<p>- Tons of fun, with more to come!<br/></p>\r\nMore updates to come!\r\n<p>I will be posting more on Twitter, so check it out. Most likely a few  updates here and there. You can expect pixel art, music and game  updates.\r\nYou can also check out Jigson's Instagram page for updates!
