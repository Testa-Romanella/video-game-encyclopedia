Oh yeah, did I say you can only see part of the maze while the rest gradually deconstructs?</p><p>Originally designed to be a 3D maze (as in a maze-cube) but quickly found that it was much too difficult to solve, even for the smaller mazes. If someone would like to see that functionality anyway I can still include it in a later release, still have the files! So just say the word if you'd like it.</p><p>Really toying with the 'poly' art style here, just to see how difficult it would be. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/3924ca4c19445f8748226d14b3291c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["caelesticode"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
