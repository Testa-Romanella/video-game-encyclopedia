Checkout my devlog here!</p>\n<p>You play as my Kitten Karl who is trying to save 4 kittens. To find these kittens you will need to fling yourself in a given direction to platform around various zones. Once you've saved a kitten you will be granted a new ability. Part platformer, part game from hell, will there be bugs!? You bet there will be. Do I care, not for a second. You might just need to reload the game and start over, but hey you choose to play this game.. mwahahaha.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move mouse around to aim</li><li>Left-Click to apply force in direction of mouse</li><li>Hold Left-Click to charge up Jump</li><li>See more notes on the abilities below if you want to be spoiled</li></ul>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Once you come to rest, wait for a little bit before you click again to fling the cat. Sometimes the charge up won't work and that's just part of playing a free game that was made in 24 hrs.</li></ul>\n<p>Proudly made with the Godot Engine</p>\n<p>Devlog for making this in 24 hours:</p>\n\n<p>To prepare for Ludam Dare 50 on April 1st 2022, I challenged myself to make a game in 24 hours without knowing the theme. I had to make all my own art assets and at least 1 audio asset. My friend came up with the Theme for me. This was a very hard challenge and it got the best of me. But I feel more prepared for LD50.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Ability Spoilers Below:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bonk:\u00a0can ram into certain walls to break them. Unlocked after the first kitten is rescued</li><li>Wall Cling:\u00a0Press and hold SPACE bar when colliding with platform.

This is unlocked after the second kitten is saved.</li><li>Mega Pounce:\u00a0Collide with the BLUE squares to empower the next jump.\u00a0These blue squares will respond after some time. The next jump will be twice as strong.
