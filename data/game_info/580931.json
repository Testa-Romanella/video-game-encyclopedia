Don't get caught by Tracker<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I didn't make any difficulty setting and this game is definitely not easy \ud83d\ude05</p>\n<p>DM me your best time if you win</p>\n<p>Maybe I'll code a difficulty setting if it's too hard \ud83e\udd14</p>\n\n<p>In-depth description:</p>\n<p>Your goal is to exit the map as quickly as you can.\u00a0You'll spawn randomly inside the map with 4 walls. There is exactly 1 exit (a pile of logs that you need to walk through), however, it's blocked unless you are carrying the\u00a0backpack. You'll need to find this randomly-spawned backpack, pick it up (press 'E'), and navigate to the log pile exit to win the game, all while avoiding the AI trying to catch you. If you get caught with or without the backpack, the game is over. Use the various terrain and obstacles spread around the map to hide from Tracker or escape from a chase. You can always drop the backpack by pressing 'E' again.</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. It's 100%\u00a0free to download and play, you can skip through the donation screen if you choose.
