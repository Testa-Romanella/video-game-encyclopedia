The objective of this game is to follow the instructions correctly and play with both paddles, using the space bar to switch control from one to another, effectively playing pong with yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things may get <strong>wacky </strong>after a while. Will you keep following the instructions?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0How to Play\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Move the active paddle\u00a0with WASD or Arrow Keys.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Switch active paddles by pressing Spacebar.</li></ul>\n<p>The game will give you goals such as \"Score with player 1\" or \"Keep the ball rolling\". The actual score of each player is not important, what matters is to follow the instructions correctly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0Differences between normal and chaos mode\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Chaos mode has 1.75x speed right at the beginning, but each speed increase/decrease is random across the game (with the tendency to become more and more difficult). The songs are randomized and so are all screen effects. It's harder than normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0Credits\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>All assets made by me, except a font:</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/caja.font\u00a0by\u00a0jsr_Games<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/899/899615a2e28796e754eae90046e1f5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thinker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
