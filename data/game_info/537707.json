Closing your bag and moving for less than a second should fix that problem. Hopefully it won't occur.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I wish you much fun with the game and happy holidays!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:31:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d978eb314cfdf87a42594552e053572f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrDonJohn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
