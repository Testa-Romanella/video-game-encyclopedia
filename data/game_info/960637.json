Find clues to aid you on your mission to solve these cases. Once the case has been solved, you\u2019ll be tasked with having to deal with whatever creature is responsible.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Use the knowledge gained from your cases to capture these ferocious cryptids. Traps and other weapons can be used to subdue the creature, once secured, they will be displayed back at your FOB.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Use vehicles to quickly traverse large areas and to escape pursuing cryptids. Be wary when driving though, hitting something while moving too fast can result in you being thrown off your bike, allowing the monster time to catch up.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Freely Customize your hunter\u2019s hair, tops, bottoms, bags, shoes, and much more.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Play with up to 3 other Hunters. It\u2019ll be much easier to secure the more aggressive monsters with some friends.
