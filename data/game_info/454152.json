You wake up in your tent to a foggy cold forest, late in the night all alone, you feel strange and your head is pounding.\u00a0Realizing it's getting colder by the minute and\u00a0no radios or flashlights are working , you must light the torch you found to keep warm, use the compass you have to\u00a0 explore and also\u00a0using your new found Ability \"Sixth Sense\" to find a way to safety while finding anything to keep you from going insane.\u00a0Find out what happened to your other team members, the past excavation team and escape the forest!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>WASD - Movement<br/>LEFT SHIFT - Speed Walk<br/>C - Crouch<br/>E - Interact<br/>F - Compass/Objective<br/>Q - Sixth Sense<br/>TAB - Change view 3rd-person/\u00a0Fixed 1st-person<br/>ESC/P - Pause<br/></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATES\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>VERSION 1.1<br/></strong>-Health Widget Removed<br/>-Vignette brought down from 0.7 to 0.5<br/>-Fixed Widget Not Being Removed\u00a0After Torch Burns Out In Light/Burn Radius<br/>-Increased SpeedWalk Time From 20 To 30 Seconds<br/>-Decreased SpeedWalk Cooldown From 7.5 to 5 Seconds</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING!!!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"Sixth Sense\" Vision may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES<br/></strong>The warning is a precaution to whoever has sensitive eyes or is photosensitive, I'm not sure if it can actually cause harm but I know it is bright and\u00a0does have a decent amount of\u00a0moving light/Imagery so please be careful, it's better to be safe then sorry!</p>\n<p>Also Fixed First-Person is a first person like style like classic DOOM where you can only\u00a0look left and right but not up and down, It is just something that is for variety and it is playable in that view but I would suggest using the third-person view for finding notes, pick ups and such.</p>\n<p><strong>OTHER NOTES<br/></strong>This is my second game I've made with Unreal Engine, This game I believe is unforgiving and is hard depending on how good you are at games, If having Frame Rate issues please try the \"Low\" Graphics settings in the menu screen, This game also runs in \"Full Screen 1920x1080\" by Default, so please enjoy and please leave any Comments or Constructive Criticism/Feedback!
