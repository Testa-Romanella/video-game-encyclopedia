I don't want to spoil the character here (<em>which I'm still actively writing</em>), but know that he loves control, leading to him enslaving those he loved so that they wouldn't tell him what to do and so that they would love him back, no matter what.\r\n</p>\n<p>But young me wasn't very bright with game development and made the most spaghetti code that's ever been spaghetti. I struggled to fix many of the bugs I found throughout the game's code and I'm just lucky it works.\r\n</p>\n<p>Will I ever try remaking the game? Probably not, but I would love to if I had the time.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This page is just an archive and memory of a game I failed to make.\r\nThe current version of the game\u00a0is canceled, I am no longer actively developing it, and it is\u00a0very unfinished.\r\nThere were over 1,000\u00a0lines of code just for the main script (<em>if you are a programmer, you should know that's a lot</em>), and I do not have the time, nor the commitment, to complete this game I canceled over a year ago.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(<em>this is content that I never finished during the time I had previously worked on it and cannot finish due to erasing necessary models and specific character stories</em>)</p>\n<ul><li>All of the nightly tasks (<em>the tasks are shown at the end of each night but aren't playable</em>)\r\n</li><li>Multiple endings with player choices (<em>including night six's \"true ending\"</em>)\r\n</li><li>Complete character dialogue (<em>the first three tapes were finished</em>)\r\n</li><li>Actual Spoon model (<em>meet cardboard spoon instead</em>)\r\n</li><li>More props and\u00a0finished areas\r\n</li><li>Two unfinished enemies</li></ul>\n<p>I also originally wanted to make a whole series out of this. I had written down ideas for two potential sequels, sad we'll never get to see them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59c612093ec55ac7236a391ba29f997b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["IronProject"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
