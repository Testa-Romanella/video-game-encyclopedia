Currently there are:</p>\n<ul><li>Food: gives you health. Not pickable if full health.</li><li>Map revealer: show the full map of the level.</li><li>Torch: increases your range of view. It's subtle with each torch, but noticeable after a few ones.</li><li>Final <em>Amulet (of Eskandor?)</em>: in the last level.</li></ul>\n<p>The only difference between easy, normal and hard is the amount of health points that the food items recovers: 3 for easy, 2 for normal and 1 for hard. Game modes can be edited in %APPDATA%/Rogueskiv/gameModes.</p>\n<p>If you give it a try, I'd love to hear any kind of feedback.</p>\n<p>This first version is a proof of concept with only the minimum features to make it playable. The idea is to add more features like:</p>\n<ul><li>More enemy types</li><li>More terrains (e.g.: water, ice, lava, ...)</li><li>More items (e.g.: armor to increase max health)</li><li>Traps</li><li>More mechanics (e.g.: closed doors and keys)</li><li>And more... player classes (warrior, wizard, ...)? shops? puzzles? bosses or boss-alike rooms?</li></ul>\n<p>License: AGPL-3.0<br/>Web: crul.github.io/Rogueskiv<br/>GitHub: github.com/Crul/Rogueskiv<br/>Subreddit: r/rogueskiv</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a258bde1eb9eaf346e6f55fd80e30190.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crul"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
