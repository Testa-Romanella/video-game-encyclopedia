You will most positively find a bug or two. I uploaded the game this early to get bug reports and feedback. <strong>This game is based off a Umedy course, but I've made major tweaks and completely different game mechanics that separates this game from the course.\u00a0</strong>Please leave a comment if you encounter a bug or have a suggestion. <strong>The map is NOW playable since version 0.2. If you help me now, I can finish the game faster and make it the best it could be.\u00a0</strong>Oh, and also,\u00a0<strong>THE CHARACTER IS A MALE. This is my first game I've ever got as far as uploading.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/239/239e305d666b7e82cfa7da93f17b34f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheNormalNoob"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
