You need to cross all obstacles while avoiding attacks from behind and keep running forward. The operation is simple, just move left and right, jump up and down, and pay attention to the timing to avoid obstacles in a timely manner.<br/>\r\n Contrary to the tense and thrilling feeling that most parkour games have, this game gives a particularly relaxed feeling. <br/>\r\nThe graphics style of the game is very similar to an ink wash painting, without any unnecessary buttons or text. The painting style is simple, and the graphics are fresh and cute. Hurry up and challenge your friends!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T07:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/88938f61a85ba685a8d3ea1865a974a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prophecy"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["prophecy"], "esrb_rating": null}
