In this power vacuum, men grow bold.  An oppressive empire begins to form and spread across the land, burning, pillaging and murdering as they go.  The callousness and cruelty of the new Empire is not without consequence, however.  When imperial soldiers attack a small farmstead, a new enemy is created. A young man and his two sisters manage to escape this attack at great cost and vow revenge against those who wronged them.<br/><br/><strong>Warlord is a text-heavy visual novel.</strong>  You play as a male farm-boy with a dark secret: Preceding the attack on your farmstead, you were mortally wounded. To save your life, your sisters brought you to a witch who performed a bonding ritual between you and a succubus spirit.  The spirit makes you capable of using abilities associated both chaos and lust.  Choosing to use these abilities changes your outlook and enables and limits future choices in the game.  Choose your affinities wisely.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li> Male protagonist<br/></li><li> Animations<br/></li><li> AI generated visualizations<br/></li><li> Immersive story telling</li></ul><br/>Current Content (as of version 0.5):<br/><ul><li> 6 Chapters<br/></li><li> 40+ animated images and CG<br/></li><li> 4 animated sex-scenes</li></ul><br/>Content \"Flavors\" (current and planned):<br/><ul><li> Oral Sex<br/></li><li> Male-Female Sex<br/></li><li> Incest<br/></li><li> Handjob<br/></li><li> Corruption<br/></li><li> Hypnosis (seduction)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T03:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/588ef12200970530ed4e73a89cf09aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["deepglugs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["deepglugs"], "esrb_rating": null}
