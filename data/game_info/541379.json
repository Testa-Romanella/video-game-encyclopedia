The main mechanic of the game is that jumping makes change color and you can only interact with objects of the same color. So is you are red you will go through blue platform, but if you jump you will be able to stand on it, however if it's blue spikes you would probably just want to go throught them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T02:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fe957eb5886c4aa0ae3bb46885fbe95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xacrom"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
