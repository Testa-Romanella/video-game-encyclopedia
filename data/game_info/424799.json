I don't know man, you do your own thing.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, at the insistence of my one playtester, I have added a chill mode for each level so you can take in the soundscape and be a ducky/bunny in peace for a minute if you want.<br/></p>\n<p>Bearing in mind that I am no artist, I'm happy with how this turned out! My first time playing with shaders and I'm proud of what I managed to do <br/></p>\n<p>This was made for the BeatTheBoredom Jam, and hopefully gives a little slice of the peaceful outdoors in people's homes.</p>\n<p>And, if you turn on full bee mode, you can remember the horrors of the outside world too.
