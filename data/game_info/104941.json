{"id": 104941, "slug": "dead-exit-itch", "name": "Dead Exit (itch)", "name_original": "Dead Exit (itch)", "description": "<p>Dead Exit is a zombie apocalypse based card game where each player manages a base and tries to out maneuver their opponents and survive the evacuation of a city. Manage your base. Make alliances.Break alliances. Betray sworn allies at the worst possible time and leave them to get eaten by the hordes. It's up to you how you play it, just make sure you get out of the city with enough resources to survive!</p>\n<p>Please try the Demo and consider helping Greenlight the full game which will give you double the unique cards and lots of game options.</p>\n<p>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...<br/></p>\n<p>A few notes</p>\n<p>+ The default is fastest but selection effects only work on higher settings. We recommend beautiful, but whatever your PC is comfortable handling.</p>\n<p>+ The game can take a few seconds to load so be patient with that silly black screen. We'll try and do something about it later.</p>\n<p>+ Full game is 1-8 players in multiplayer. </p>\n<p>+ With half the cards not in the demo, 4 player multiplayer can be pretty short, brutal and more reliant on luck. Maybe work together :)</p>\n<p>+Get on the forums and let us know what you like and what you aren't so keen on, as well as what confused the ever living crap out of you.</p>\n<p>+You may experience a hang if you alt-tab. we'll try and get this resolved. Sorry for the awkwardness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e2e5578ec5da61c5e6820acaf06acfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zenorf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
