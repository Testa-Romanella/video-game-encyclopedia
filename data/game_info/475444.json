Computer viruses have been able to make portals to get into the real world. They have destroyed the battery that controls the lights on the ship soon they will destroy the thrusters. You are a service robot that has gotten an upgrade that put a cannon on your side. Luckily you have a battery that powers a light on your head. The battery drains pretty fast but you have the option of pressing E that charges you battery. Sadly you have to stop moving and you can\u2019t shoot while you charge. You can press space bar to shoot. W.A.S.D is your up down left and right movement keys.\u00a0\u00a0You can press H to skip the level if you can\u2019t figure out how to solve the level.
