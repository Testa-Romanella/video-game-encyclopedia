The way the game is designed, we recommend that you refresh and repeat it a few times. Then you get to understand the mechanics of using the trending-console, to search for the right hashtags in the right places, and to operate in a faster paste. Between levels, the frame would optimally announce how many likes the player has left to reach the goal.<br/><br/>- Use arrow keys to move</p><p>- Use space to post pictures</p><p>- Choose the hashtags that are trending (in the console to the right)<br/><br/>Welcome to the hectic world of a like-gatherer! Post the best pictures, use the right hashtags, and one day, you might get the legendary 100 000 likes, and to become happy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1edef0fe1190a2691ed668f8a16e44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kvemo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
