The mafia has other ideas: stealing the world\u2019s largest Golden acorn would be a real coup! But who are the best thieves in the city?<br/><br/>So begin the Mafia Pigs challenges: test your wits against your friends and other players online to pull off the most daring heists! <br/><br/>But be careful. The city guards REALLY don\u2019t want you grabbing the golden acorn, and they\u2019ll knock you out if they spot you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tired of getting one-shotted in the latest extraction shooter? In Mafia Pigs, use your brains and skill to trick your opponents and grab the prize - no killing allowed. KO\u2019s put you down for a while, but you can always come back and snatch glory at the end! <br/><br/>Use the environment and tricks on others to gain an advantage. Each match is for up to 6 players and randomizes the goals on the map. <br/><br/>Find all the keys and grab loot along the way to boost your score. Use ridiculous powerups to beat your friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With so many thieves and grifters invading their territory, the city guards are on red alert (when not sleeping off a big lunch, that is). Try to sneak around unnoticed, but see where you can slow down your opponents by arousing suspicion, sounding alarms, and setting traps. <br/><br/>No players or guards can be killed permanently \u2026 the mafia doesn\u2019t want anyone to get seriously hurt. Just a little roughing up and a few knockouts here and there are fair game! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Play with up to 6-players in cooperative online multiplayer for Mac and PC. Create your own lobbies with friends or play in public lobbies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Play single-player tutorial missions to learn the ropes and uncover some of the secrets of the Mafia Pigs world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Find us at the following locations on social media: <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T04:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e7ee64dac3200b6f47dfcb726e2187.jpg", "website": "http://www.mafiapigs.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Timewarp"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Timewarp"], "esrb_rating": null}
