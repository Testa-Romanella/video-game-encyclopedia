In The Lair you are a monster defending your lair from annoying heroes.

If you balance your use of corpses (And aren't too unlucky with randomness) things gets easier when you achieve new powers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcda893b2a5c7e27c4e92d0171a1880f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Mekuri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
