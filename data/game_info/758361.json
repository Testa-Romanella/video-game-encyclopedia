Added 4 new pieces of background music for the Main Menu, and 3 levels.</p>\n<p>2. New levels</p>\n<p>3. New interesting mechanics</p>\n<p>4. Eastern Eggs</p>\n<p>5. Each level is unrelated</p>\n<p>There will be no \"next level\" button when you finish playing one level. Instead, You will go back to the main menu and pick another level by yourself. The reason why I made it like this is that each level is not related to others. Each level is an individual mini-game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by Xiangyu Meng (\u5b5f\u7965\u5b87\uff09</p>\n<p>--Special Thanks to Ziyu Hao for helping me improve my music creation.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun and enjoy my game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:42:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eee70a64cc0ba8c09b47b62f47e8eb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["MichaelMXY"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
