When I read the description of\u00a0the original Famicase, I knew it was perfect for me! So, I reached out to the artist, roby, for permission to adapt their famicase;\u00a0little did I know that I'd make a good friend\u00a0in the process!<br/></p>\n<p>Concept and cover art by roby. Backgrounds are modified public domain photos with appropriate licensing. Fonts used are Jann Script and Lilly; they are both\u00a0CC0-licensed fonts.</p>\n<p>This game <strong>IS CURRENTLY A DEMO!</strong> I ran out of time to put the full script in the game by\u00a0the game jam deadline, so the demo ends at week 15.\u00a0 There is also a little bit of placeholder text.\u00a0I will be adding the rest of the story\u00a0(weeks 16-30) in about a week --\u00a0so, don't forget to check for updates!</p>\n<p>If you liked the game, please leave a comment below!
