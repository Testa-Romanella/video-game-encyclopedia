The traffic moves at a snail's pace and you cannot even crack open a window because of all the exhaust gas from the cars.<br/></p>\n<p>You are tired of wasting your time and polluting the environment. So you decided to raise money for\u00a0your <strong>Autonomous Rideshare</strong> company and your electric delivery bus!<br/></p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>Your main goal is to <strong>fulfill the delivery requests</strong> (whether it be a commuter, food etc.)\u00a0with your autonomous electric bus. For each request, you\u00a0need to pick up a package and deliver them to their destination. If a delivery is made on time, you will be paid the full amount.</p>\n<p>There are currently four simple towns (or levels)\u00a0in the game. The main goal is to fulfill all delivery requests (roughly on time) and raise enough money to go to the next town.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>- You <strong>left click</strong> on a building to move your bus there. If there is a relevant request(s) for that building (whether pick up or delivery) the bus will serve them.</p>\n<p>- You can <strong>right click</strong> to undo the last action you made.</p>\n<p>- You will need to plan your route based on fulfilling multiple pick up and deliveries at the same time. Complete deliveries on time to maximize your profit!</p>\r\nWhat's Next?\r\n<p>The basic premise and the core gameplay is there. Currently, I am:</p>\n<p>- Working on interweaving the story with the gameplay</p>\n<p>-Adding multiple countries, cities, buildings, and request types\u00a0in the game's story to make the experience more unique for each level</p>\n<p>- Working on the game's art and animations to provide more intuitive and smoother gameplay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f5175d3dafee2affaef4e0f958872c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gbird"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
