{"id": 81621, "slug": "the-widow-lite", "name": "The Widow Lite", "name_original": "The Widow Lite", "description": "The Widow (or La Viuda, similar to Whisky Poker) is a card game in which every player starts with the same number of chips and the last player with chips remaining wins. Every round players exchange cards with a middle \"Widow\" hand to make their best poker hands. At the end of each round, the player with the worst poker hand has to put in 1 of their chips. <br/><br/>In this app you can: <br/>- Play against 1-6 AI opponents on 3 different difficulty levels (EASY, NORMAL and HARD). <br/>- Choose to play with Jokers and/or Round Wilds (the number of chips in the pot designates the wild each round). <br/>- Choose to play with The Life (an extra chip that starts in the pot and is used by the first player who would lose their last chip). <br/>- Choose to start with 1-10 chips. <br/><br/>All opponents have names and tendencies that determine how often they knock or exchange cards conservatively or aggressively. For example, you may notice Cheech is willing to exchange better hands more often than others or that Myles tends to knock more often.<br/><br/>This Lite version comes with ads.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8699482b9bfaa0842fb339713f3081.jpg", "website": "http://www.twistedinflux.com/thewidow.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["TwistedInflux"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["TwistedInflux"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
