The bouncing ball squishes as it speeds up, and both balls have trails that looks like \"tails\". There's an eye that progressively opens up as you get further, and it follows the position of the bouncing ball. When you die, the ball you control explodes like megaman.</p>\n<p><strong>Sam Fisher</strong></p>\n<p>The first project we did for our course, the goal was to make pretty much anything we wanted out of a very barebone template RPG project.</p>\n<p>I ended up turning it into a fishing game (the fishing was originally gonna be just one part of the game's short \"main quest\" but I got a bit lazy) where you fish out \"\"\"fishes\"\"\" from either ponds on the map</p>\n<p><strong>Slasher</strong></p>\n<p>I forgot what the goal of that specific project was, but I ended up making a prototype for a combat game where you move around your character with generic controls, but control your weapon entirely with your mouse. Right now the goal is just to slash around a robot and try to keep him up in the air to increase the combo counter.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm still thinking of maybe remaking it\u00a0 from scratch into a pvp multiplayer game eventually.</p>\n<p>Main inspirations were Nidhogg and DMC</p>\n<p><strong>Amak</strong></p>\n<p>That one is actually a 2 person project, made with SeedHolt</p>\n<p>The goal was to make a dungeon crawling game with procedurally generated levels<br/>We ended up going with something inspired from zelda 1 and Kid Icarus</p>\n<p>I made the procedural generation system and the enemy code, Holt made all of the graphics, the player character and the vast majority of dungeon rooms</p>\n<p>Slightly janky and a bit hard but it turned out pretty well.</p>\n\n<p>Please refer to the readme of each game for controls.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T05:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/933f7418010846b4a9f890b668f6d5c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PaperMartin", "SeedHolt"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
