Journey before destination\" from the Stromlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is a \"rogue-like\" I made for the Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam's Stronger Together theme.</p>\n<p>You've entered a foorbidden area, and must tread carefully. Gather up allies while traversing this dungeon, and clear it of its corruption.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Move arrows/WASD, select the player and companions with LMB and aim with arrows/WASD, and select the aimed square, again with the mouse to attack. It's more about timing and positioning, so let the enemy come to you and move slighly to avoid the attack.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Art assets and code made  by me in Godot and Aseprite, going solo for the Brackeys Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Font from (https://www.dafont.com/es/8-bit-arcade.font) by Ansimuz</p>\n<p>Music from (http://billydolanart.com/rpg-tracks) by Billy Dolan</p>\n<p>Sounds from (youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ) by HeartBeast<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4885abd2a1820e8213502aff0f20d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Touff97"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
