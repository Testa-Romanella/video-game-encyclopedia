What more could you ask for?</strong><br/><br/><strong>Conflicks: Revolutionary Space Battles</strong> is a creative new take on space-themed videogames that merges the deep, thoughtful gameplay of strategy games with the intuitive accessibility of physics-based games. <br/><br/>The game universe is a futuristic alternate history of the European Renaissance that combines elements from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries with science fiction and an oddball sense of humor into a stylized, absurdist world that never takes itself too seriously. Conflicks can be played in a single-player campaign mode where missions are linked together by a story, as well as in competitive battles (against other players or AI).<br/><br/>Pledge your allegiance to Greater-Britain, the Celestial Empire, the Sacred Alliance or the Sublime Gate and harvest metamatter in the name of your emperor, or join  the Chk\u2019Rathii and lead the Revolution against those poultry-hoarding galactic despots!Main Features<br/><ul><li>Original game mechanics based on the principle of flicking.
