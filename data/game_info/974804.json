It tells the story of Aotsuki Ushio, the son of a temple priest who lives in the family&#39;s shrine. One day, he literally stumbles on a mystical cave and accidentally free Tora, a hideous tiger-like demon his ancestors captured and sealed inside the den five hundred years earlier. The demon was trapped with the mystical Beast Spear and Ushio released him as he tried to take the enchanted weapon. Unsurprisingly, Tora immediately wants to eat the young boy, but the monster soon realizes that his presence in the human world also summons all kind of other demons.
