In having a singular mechanic in which you could interact with environmental elements, I could iterate further on what kinds of puzzles could be explored, and the simulated consequences of such a simple input mechanic.<br/></p>\n<p>In being about pointing and shooting light, players are focused on positioning and line-of-sight to interact with objects, as well as witnessing the consequences of what each interactive object can do; such as moving, rotating, or animating various sections of architecture.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was showcased and exhibited at Armageddon at Auckland in 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/4064ec3c3e4b60c471a66d543ba748e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emotion Theory"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
