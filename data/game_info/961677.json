Luckily, we analyzed their technology so that we can also perform Jumps to escape from them. However, it's necessary for us to collect fuels in the space, in order to move and jump. We could also rescue lost people and ships, and add them to our fleet. With our advanced Initializer, we can Initialize ships' weapon system and invite them into our battleship fleet; we can also Initialize people's  Implanted learning devices to let them join as crew members. But PLEASE remember, Initialization cost TIME, and jump during Initialization would abandon what's being Initialized.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControl: WASD/Arrow + Enter/Mouse\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHope you enjoy this game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T05:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8435ae429481c9c50ec79dd23def9a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiansu Game Design"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tiansu Game Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
