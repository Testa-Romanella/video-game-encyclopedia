While exploring the world of Barkelona, students will converse with dogs and humans, practicing basic conversation questions such as C\u00f3mo te llamas and De d\u00f3nde eres. They will also read stories at the library, go on quests to help their new friends, and learn new words by clicking on objects. They can go shopping in the city\u2019s famous market and go swimming at the beach. Playing Barkelona requires students to read thousands of words of text. It is no substitute for reading a novel, but it can be a great addition!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c7652f8ff231833e3ddec28ee1c6ace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hood Mentality Software Studio", "Hood Mentality Software"], "genres": ["Casual", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hood Mentality Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
