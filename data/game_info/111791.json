Dr. Bon Bon needs your help. Match three or more bonbons to clear them and four or more to morph into a bonus star. When the test tubes are full, click two to unleash Dr. Bon Bon's patented bonbon-melding technology!</p><p>This is my first time making a game like this, so please let me know what you think! Also, the WebGL build has a few issues, like the test tube bubbles looking weird - it should run fine, but you can also download the game for the best result.</p><p>Original concept and cover art: @haimeh_ugarte</p><p>Design and code: @etc_celia</p><p>Game art: @rose_abernathy</p><p>Sounds by: HerbertBortland, qubodup, Kastenfrosch, renatalmar, Timbre</p><p>Music: Gee - Electroswing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb721b6a783c7cb7daaf7b76636940c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Celia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
