{"id": 292849, "slug": "captain-ed", "name": "Captain Ed", "name_original": "Captain Ed", "description": "<p>The player controls a ship armed with a blaster and a large mallet; they must navigate through &quot;space&quot; - an environment vaguely resembling a disco floor - while avoiding various other spaceships (or preferably destroying them to earn money!). Destroying enemies with the mallet is risky but nets a money bonus. In addition, the player&#39;s gas (life) ticks down constantly. It is also reduced by damage from enemies. To counter-act this slow grind to the death, the player must buy more gas. This results in cyclic game play; destroy more enemies to buy more gas. In addition, the color-changing floor has various effects on the ship: On green tiles, gas consumption is at the normal rate, on yellow tiles it is slightly increased. Red tiles rapidly deplete gas and violently shift the spaceship; this can result in difficult situations where the ship is forcibly moved from one red tile to another repeatedly. Blue tiles, only revealed by the pickup of a smiley face, very slightly increase the player&#39;s gas, but at such a slow rate it is almost unnoticeable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-14T17:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/124/124f0b4e2797b1b9ec01d22203a40574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Graphic Research"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
