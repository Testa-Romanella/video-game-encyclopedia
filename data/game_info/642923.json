The young hero is being sent to battle the War God\u2019s child \u2013 Phobos. His journey will take him to many different corners of mythological lands where he will obtain powerful artifacts that will aid him in his quest. Achilles is not alone as Hephaistos \u2013 the god of blacksmiths - is always ready to craft new weapons in exchange for materials.</p>\n<p>Achilles: Legends Untold is an isometric action RPG game, greatly inspired by the souls-like genre and old-school hack&amp;slash games. The players will venture through many unwelcoming locations, battling legendary creatures and trying to piece up the story of the world. The game is a bit lighter on the \u201csouls\u201d side, as the studio wanted to create an easy-to-learn but hard to master experience. Because of that, Achilles: Legends Untold may be enjoyed by the souls veterans and new players alike. And if help is needed, just summon your friends to play together in jolly cooperation, and explore various dungeons together.</p>\n<p>The gameplay features enjoyable and skill-based combat, RPG elements, and resource management. Every item found on the journey might prove itself useful in creating new weapons and gear when brought back to Hephaistos. Throughout the game, players will become more and more skillful alongside the main character, gaining the ability to take on even more powerful foes! And you can be sure there are plenty of abominable and dreadful enemies that will cross your path.</p>\n<p>Achilles: Legends Untold also features an innovative GAIA system, responsible for the AI characters\u2019 actions who feel lifelike and work together in unpredictable ways. Experience immersive battles in which monsters adapt to your playstyle, try different strategies, or create ambush scenarios, driven by this contemporary in-house designed system.<br />\nWill you be persistent enough to grow in strength and take down Ares?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-15T23:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/885/885c09b88e24d15d954112328506dd60.jpg", "website": "https://darkpointgames.com/games/achilles/", "rating": 2.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 29, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 593, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Point Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dark Point Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
