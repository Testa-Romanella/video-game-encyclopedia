You arrive at the infamous Anomaly in your old little Flea spaceship. Your goal is to reach the Anomaly, which is no easy task due to deadly radiation it spits out into the space.</p><p>This game doesn't show you where you should go next, so you might stuck. There are some tips further down here.

If you pick a bad trajectory, it's harder to correct it when you're already going.</p>\n<p>Use giant girder constructions\u00a0to orient yourself in space. Remember their shapes to recognize places where you have already been.</p>\n<p>Some spaceships have logs. Reading them might be helpful.</p>\n<p>When you do certain things, the game will change how your respawn in case of death. This preserves some of the progress you made, but this does not persist between game launches. If you close the game, next time you start at the beginning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T06:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e068575484de7df1851b3a603a3f7c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dito Seregin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
