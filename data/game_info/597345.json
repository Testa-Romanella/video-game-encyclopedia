I'm not well-versed in this genre and after reviewing the many submissions that accrued over the duration of the jam, I quickly realized how little I understood of what was in store. Nonetheless, I decided that this was at minimum, an opportunity to learn and stimulate my imagination. Thus, I thank you all for that.\u00a0I saw several different avenues of creativity in the submissions, and if possible I'd be willing to work with any of you to produce more Troika-related worlds in\u00a0Stranded Eternity, as the potential seems only bounded by the limits of imagination.<br/><br/><strong>Summary Of The Game:</strong> It's a fast paced rogue-like comprised of multiple worlds in which a variety of related creatures exist which can be experienced through a variety of game modes using unlockable characters.<br/><br/><strong>Game-Jam Specific Version:\u00a0<br/><br/></strong>1) New Troika-inspired\u00a0world called\u00a0World of Chance (for this version all other worlds have been removed).\u00a0<br/>2) New\u00a0game mode called Dice and Cards to pay homage to the genre, it's not always the game mode rolled, but it eventually turns up while playing. <br/>3) New playable character (Dicer).<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> This project is far from being considered\u00a0\"polished\", it's still in an alpha stage, so there are bugs and things you might find out of place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T03:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/404/4047570c8ca7d5413e53cd3bcf209c77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["1StepCloser"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
