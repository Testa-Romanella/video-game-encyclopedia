All of the tetriminos have become randomly rolled dice, which can't be removed from the board\u00a0until they hit zero. Clearing lines removes value from all dice in a row.\u00a0Stack your dice tower, trying to clear away value at the bottom to prevent yourself from stacking out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you've cleared enough dice from the board, you'll have enough energy to roll the board itself!\u00a0Use nothing but these dice, your skills, and your wit to create massive combos and rack up a score unlike you've scene in Tetris before.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left/Right: Movement</p>\n<p>S/Down: Quick Drop</p>\n<p>D/Up: Rotate Clockwise<br/></p>\n<p>W: Hold Piece</p>\n<p>Space: Roll Board</p>\n<p>A: Rotate Counter\u00a0Clockwise<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This was a submission for the 2022 GMTK game jam.
