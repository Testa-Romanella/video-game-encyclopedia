This is the kind of game that only really comes together right at the end so I wasn't even sure if the game was going to be any good until it was done. Hopefully someone will enjoy it ;)</p><p>The game features something like 20 different patterns and you can affect the look and colour of your creatures by selecting which ones to breed. I could probably add a random wild mutation to really bring out this effect.</p><p>The story is that you are a lab technician who is breeding stronger microbes for totally non-nefarious reasons.</p><ul><li>Can you make Amoebros strong enough to escape the lab?</li><li>Gather DNA from yellow orbs and rival organisms, select which Amoebros to reproduce and reach for the edge of the map!</li><li>Zoom with the mouse wheel, scroll with the arrow keys.</li><li>Carefully pick which Ameobro to breed for desired traits.</li></ul><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/amoebros<br/></p><p>EDIT:</p><p>Fix a bug with the DNA enditor</p><p>Added a dev build, only use this if you are experiencing crashes.
