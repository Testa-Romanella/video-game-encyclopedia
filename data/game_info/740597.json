Our protagonists- a head shrine maiden of a neighboring city, the daughter of the shrine maiden, a bounty hunter rabbit, and the mother of the orphanage herself- all head out to debunk the rumors.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>4 playable characters</li><li>9* bosses to fight in a boss-rush format, one after another (*10 if you include the mini-boss at the start).</li><li>Custom made player and boss sprite graphics and spell patterns.
