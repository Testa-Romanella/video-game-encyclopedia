While holding the Yorkshire area, they cultivated the lands into large farming areas, and give York it's name (it was Jorvik during their occupation), which of course led to Yorkshire following its capital's name.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by retro dungeon crawlers, having tile based movement and timed attacks.</p>\n<p>Controls: W to move forward, S to move backwards, A to rotate left, D to rotate right, Left Click to attack, Right Click to block</p>\n<p>Credits: Jake Ogden; environment assets, level design, character assets.
