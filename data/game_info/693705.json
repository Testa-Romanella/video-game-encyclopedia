Hero? </strong><strong>Yes!</strong> You can be all of the above. :)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The brave adventurer finds some treasure maps to Captain Blarg's hidden-away and all but forgotten pirate-haven of Ye-Land-o-Plenty!<br/></p>\n<p>Captain Blarg was a pirate that loved his rum and loved his gold (aye, but don't all pirates?).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everywhere he and his crew went, they gathered what gold they could manage to get their hands on. And hey, more gold meant being able to buy more barrels-o-rum!</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that one hot day rum was running low on Ye-Land-o-Plenty and a mutiny occurred. During the furious fight that ensued between Captain Blarg (along with his handful of still loyal men) and the rest of the crew that wanted to mutiny so they could steal the horde of collected gold (that the Captain kept in his house for safe-keeping) so they could do a run to a nearby island to buy more barrels-o-rum (heck, the Captain was planning to do that anyways, but an unruly bunch of pirates being unruly pirates and all... And well, so things go.), that many gold coins got scattered about the whole place. Though the Captain was taken by surprise and defeated that day, he managed to put a voodoo curse upon the mutinous crew to forever shamble about on Ye-Land-o-Plenty. And thus, though there be lots of gold-coins to be found for a brave Treasure-Seeker on Ye-Land-o-Plenty, there are many unruly (and perhaps drunken) skeletons (what's left of the crew after a couple of hundred years later) that wander about in their never-ending search for gold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Note: Game can be played on Windows PC with the use of VICE emulator or on a real Vic-20+3K-expanded computer.\u00a0 See more\u00a0 info about this game\u00a0in the ReadMe text file that's included with the game download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71fea4a86e59b7f7d0f93995482938b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mystic Sword"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
