So if there is a block with 12 on it, then you shoot it with 2 twice\u00a0and then switch to\u00a03 weapon and shoot again. Beacuse 2*2*3=12. You can move from side to side to \"aim\".</p>\n\n<p>You have 3 lifes so if 3 blocks gets to the bottom you loose. Try getting the highest score you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made during the game jam Mix And Game Jam 2020, with the theme <em>Mix 2 game genres.\u00a0</em>This game is then a mix between a classic arcade shooter and an educational math game.</p>\n<p>All the sprites (- the hearts which are from Kenney) are made by me during the game jam.
