Unfortunately every jump he makes he looses a vertex, thus once he is a triangle he cannot jump, or else he will cease to exist.</p><p>Some information for you note. This game was made in 48 hours (More like 18 hours) In C++. With a game engine that I made, and have never tested. Expect bugs and crashes. But at least maybe an interesting story. (Though I doubt it, because I think this is one of the worst game I have ever made).</p><p>Enjoy :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53a95873398f367bf463aaef59866355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoderCameron"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
