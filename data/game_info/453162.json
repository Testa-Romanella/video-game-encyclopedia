Plant trees, save animals, clean up oil spills, help scientists, and educate yourself and others in your quest!\r\n<p>This game prototype was made in collaboration with AMY NW Middle School and Arcade Our Way, an inclusive after-school STEM games club that promotes game design as an expressive medium, especially for those who are often left out of game spaces. I worked with a group of kids, who selected the topic of the climate crisis, to design and develop a game for change.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nOur Design Goals:\r\n<p>- <strong>Non-violent.\u00a0</strong>The player collects knowledge about the climate crisis and shares it with the evil minions populating the world. If the player's aim is true, and collides with the minion, they turn into a climate activist!</p>\n<p>- <strong>Educational</strong>. All facts that players collect throughout the game have sources.\u00a0The player can review any knowledge they collect by looking in their journal. Knowledge isn't just used to educate the minions -- at the end of each level, the player must convince the boss to stop polluting the environment by selecting the correct information!</p>\n<p>- <strong>Empower players.\u00a0</strong>We want people to leave this game experience with knowledge about the climate crisis that they can directly apply to their own lives. Every little act makes a difference both in the real world and this game\u00a0-- depending on the player's dedication to greening the world, they'll get a different game ending!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dac98c78eb4052bf0a7db33be5f36ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ashley Rezvani"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
