Each action performed increases resource count, or hourly/daily resource incomes. The player must balance incomes in order to meet colonist consumption needs as well as construction and upgrade requirement costs.<br/><br/>In Roanoke, the story follows the real-life tale of The Lost Colony - a colony that once existed and has since mysteriously vanished.<br/><br/><strong>Build:</strong><br/>The player is capable of building the following:<br/>Camps: +1 Gold/Hour.<br/>Ports: +50 Gold/Day.<br/>Farms: +3 Food/Day.<br/>Homes: +1 Colonist/Day.<br/>Mines: +1 Stone/Hour.<br/><br/><strong>All of these buildings can be upgraded, indefinitely, for a flat fee of 100 stone per upgrade. When upgraded, they provide 2x income, 3x income when upgraded again, and so on and so forth.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Gather:</strong> <br/>The player is capable of gathering the following:<br/>Food: The bread and butter of the colony.<br/>Gold: Reflects score, but may also be used to permanently increase daily resource income of your choice by 1 at a port for 50g.<br/>Stone: Used for upgrades.<br/>Wood: Required for all buildings.<br/><br/><strong>Gatherable resources regenerate daily, but can also be gained each hour/day by constructing specific buildings and/or upgrading the port.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Upgrade:</strong><br/>The player is capable of upgrading the following:<br/>Camps<br/>Ports<br/>Farms<br/>Homes<br/>Mines<br/><br/><strong>Each upgrade adds the original benefits once more on top of the current building's benefits. So, if a camp provided 1 Gold/Hour it would provide 2 Gold/Hour when upgraded. This can be done indefinitely with the cost of 100 stone per upgrade.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/67128e88c221aba1be65b8f98a520d0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 49}, "playtime": 27, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FailoutGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FailoutGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
