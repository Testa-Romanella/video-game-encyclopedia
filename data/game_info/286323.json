Forget the environmental hazards of hard vacuum and skin-crisping radiation, there are nastier things out there. Along with the fact that people need to spend the entire trip in cryosleep, space travel is a lot less safe than most folks would prefer.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Guardian droids give peace of mind. Heavily armed, intelligent and resourceful, they are a crowning glory of AI design. They keep their passengers safe from the unknown.
