In the \"Alpha\" version you will only be able to be in Level 0, until the \"Beta\" version is released with 3 levels in total, or the full version with 6 initial levels (and the ones that will be added).</p>\n<p>In the game you will be able to find different clues to get out of Level 0 of the backrooms, but you will also have to be careful, because a creature will be waiting for the right moment either to give you a scare or to end your entire existence. You will have to avoid it as much as possible, because otherwise, a terrible destiny will await you.</p>\n<p>The game does not contain multiplayer or save system, as the game tries to give you the possibility to experience and explore the different levels of the backrooms, with some added scares. With no save system, this game also has no story to follow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To report bugs, join our Discord (discord.gg/eySrsyEyda) or contact us by Gmail (makingdastudios@gmail.com).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T14:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59cb8473730fada9e59a06ce336ff35a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Makingda Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
