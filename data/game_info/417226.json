Please comment any feedback you may have!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are the new General of \"Initiative 7B\". Your army of AI assisted robots and the three captains you've never met are ready for you. The Director seems to have no intention of letting you meet your captains in person but that's just one of the many oddities you've noticed in the Director's decision making. Perhaps his strange methods are what have brought him this far.</p>\n<p>Never mind that for now, though, lets\u00a0sit down and lead the initiative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schedule</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I will upload regular semi-stable updates as well as an occasional thoroughly tested stable version.
