Defend yourself from the hunters who will stop at nothing to see an end to your rampage, all the while your condition worsens.</p>\n<p>Gnash is a short arcade-like action game with a simple goal: kill or be killed. This is my first foray into creating a complete game in the unreal engine and I gave myself a self-imposed time limit of a month to finish it, which I overshot by about a week. Try it out and tell me what you think, any feedback is appreciated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T06:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e471f6f30aded10738e32fd22adb7cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Skyrgamur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
