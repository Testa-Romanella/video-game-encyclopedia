Hit as many as you can before time runs out!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is fairly simple, and it is my first attempt at something like this. The game is currently available on the Play Store for the USA, Brazil and Australia, and here at itch.io as a web version.<br/></p>\n<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LeonardoCalil.Innuendo</p><p>https://leo-calil.itch.io/innuendo<br/></p>\n<p>I used some assets available from the community and hired a programmer to help me make the experience better.</p>\n<p>I appreciate if you can test it out!
