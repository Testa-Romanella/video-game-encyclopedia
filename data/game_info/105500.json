Guide this person to salvation using environmental cues and your own smarts. <strong>Through Oneself</strong> is a unique puzzle-platformer created for Ludum Dare 35 within 72-hours by one person, where your character itself reveals a new hidden world. Use the visual cues in both the real and hidden to navigate through this treacherous world!</p><p><em>Note: a 3-button mouse (mouses with scroll wheels) vastly improves the game, but is not necessary to play.</em><br/></p><p><em><em>Confused? Here's a big hint! Your character can only interact with what's visible inside of her silhouette. So use that scroll wheel to zoom in and take a closer look at what the invisible world looks like!</em><br/></em></p><p>This game is funded through Patreon.
