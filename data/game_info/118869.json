If you never die.</p><p>I don't think the difficulty is balanced very well though, so, good luck with that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea80c25bd23c106a9922a3850b4bfa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carl Maxwell"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
