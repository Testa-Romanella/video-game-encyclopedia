Each tenant is dealing with their own struggles in regards to work/life balance, and through the player's interactions can come to realize the error of their ways or descend deeper into their unhealthy lifestyles. The game is similar to a point-and-click adventure game, but being a musical, it is also interspersed with songs from the tenants that lament their hopes and fears at different points during the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse Only - Point &amp; Click Adventure game style</p>\n<p>Musical Numbers!</p>\n<p><strong>Press:\u00a0</strong></p><p><em>\"Cardamom is the rare game where voiced characters will occasionally express themselves through music, and it adds an element of earnest charm to this cute game about a cat solving emotional problems in an apartment block.\"</em>\u00a0- PC Gamer\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\"<em>A little musical adventure with a\u00a0big heart.</em>\"- Alpha Beta Gamer<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Follow Cardamom's development:\u00a0</strong>Twitter\u00a0-\u00a0Website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353db203124f732b564572666c069c2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Artizaw5um"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
