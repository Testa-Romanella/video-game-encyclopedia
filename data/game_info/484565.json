Your journey will take you to five locations across the length and breadth of Britain\u2026<br/><br/><h3>East Coast Main Line</h3><br/>The iconic HST kick-started an era of high-speed rail travel and went on to prove itself as capable and versatile over many of Britain\u2019s main lines. Take the HST over one of the busiest railway routes on the British network, the East Coast Main Line, and experience life in the fast lane.<br/><br/><h3>Great Eastern Main Line</h3><br/>The BR Class 360 has proven hugely successful in high capacity commuter travel, with its spacious interior and modern driving cab. Command this hard-working EMU through the dense urban network of east London, departing the third busiest station in the UK at Liverpool Street.<br/><br/><h3>Portsmouth Direct Line</h3><br/>One of the busiest commuter networks in Britain, the south western network is serviced by an array of modern EMUs including BR Classes 444, 450, 455/8 and 377s. Step into the driving cabs of four of Britain\u2019s iconic commuter trains and ferry your passengers to Portsmouth out of London\u2019s magnificent Waterloo station.<br/><br/><h3>Settle to Carlisle</h3><br/>Famous for its numerous viaducts, tunnels and stunning scenery, the Settle-Carlisle line attracts thousands of railfans from all over the world every year. Take control of powerful heavy freight machines, regional passenger and even steam engines and battle the many summits, twists and turns of Cumbria\u2019s historic Lake District route.<br/><br/><h3>Chatham Main &amp; Medway Valley Lines</h3><br/>Connecting England's garden with London, the south-eastern route through the heart of the Medway valley is operated heavily by third rail powered multiple units. Transport passengers with a wide range of electric multiple units such as the BR Class 375 and BR Class 465 or weave through the busy traffic with American-built BR Class 59 heavy freight locomotives.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ultimate railway hobby powers Great British Railway Journeys!
