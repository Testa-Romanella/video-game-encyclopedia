The course was an introduction to Flash and Actionscript, as well as to creating interactive media using Flash.</p><p>At the end of the classes proper and before students started their course projects, I created a game using the course materials to show what they could do with what they had learned. As such, SPACE BLAST isn't made the \"right\" way: code is all placed in actions in the Flash project, everything exists on the stage, and I used the stage timeline to create the different game scenes.</p><p>It was still an interesting exercise, as it was my first time creating a Flash game the \"wrong\" way, and it was my first time creating what I consider an arcade-like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e86a6a2bb2090ab60d3fce0fe42721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xavier Stamps-Lafont"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
