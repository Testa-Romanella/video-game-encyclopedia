Play as Aella, a spunky Falkonir, or Horu, the brave Falcon, as you work together to explore a mountain devastated by wild magic and plagued by nightmarish wraiths to put an end to the corruption. On the continent of Myrelin lies a village to the Northwest known as Frostfall. It is here the kingdom, Kingstone, trains the most elite scout units Myrelin has ever seen, the Falkonirs. It is the Falkonir's sworn duty to watch over the lands to protect the kingdom from any encroaching armies or outbursts of wild magic and monsters.  On a day like any ordinary, Aella begins training with her falcon, Horu, and her mentor. When suddenly the ground trembles and shakes, and a thunderous crack pierces through the air revealing that Mount Bohlgast has unleashed its stored nightmares. Wraiths begin to manifest and envelop everything in their surroundings. With Aella barely saved by Horu's newfound strength, it is up to the two of them to end whatever wild magic is plaguing their people.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T03:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df21ad158fcf7190989b9667baa7103d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fowl Play Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Fowl Play Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
