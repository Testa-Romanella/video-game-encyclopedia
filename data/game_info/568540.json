Collect souls from enemies and spend them on upgrades after you die. You have to die to give your descendants a fighting chance against the demons below!<br/></p>\n<p>This idea was somewhat inspired by the mechanics of Infinity Blade, which was an IOS \"boss rush\" in the 3rd person, where you fight the same enemies as your ancestors.</p>\n<p>If this game has scratched an itch for you, and you'd like to see what I work on in the future, then there's good news!
