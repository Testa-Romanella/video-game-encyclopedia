HedgeJam.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I see you are one of these spoiled people. Infinite food, oxygen, space to live and light. but you do not value these things in any way.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>So tell me how it would be for you if you had only one of each.</em></p>\n<p><em>How it would feel if I stuck you in a lonely, cramped dungeon.</em></p>\n<p><em>What would that feel like? Well, let's simply . . .\u00a0find . . . it out . . .</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>In Daze N Willow you'll take control of a small candle that is looking for its lost, once eternal goods. Can you reclaim them and escape the endless yawn?<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>The game was made for the 5th HedgeJam and such in 2 weeks. I (Nosioce) did all the 3D models, music and scripts. The game was developed in Unreal5, the music was composed in Ableton live 11 and the models were made in Blender 3.4. I recorded every step and will post the devlog sometime later, I just need to edit the hours of footage into a short video.</p>\n\n<p>this is my very first gamejam, so let me know if i have made any blunders.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>15.04 -\u00a0(Updated to version a1.1 - Performance improvements and visual fixes)</em><br/></p><p><em>16.04 -\u00a0</em><em>(Updated to version a1.2 - Added a graphics settings menu)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T20:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/86993d535e92d05245bb901a01b79b2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nosioce"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
