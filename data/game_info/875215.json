I focused on the feeling of tiredness because it was the most prominent and shared feeling from my real experience, now no one was actually passing out, but I felt the game needed some dramatic stakes. In addition to the well-known goals of hide and seek, I chose to use upfront the feeling of tiredness to also become a feature of the game that the player has some control over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T11:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcc49aa1f47619e222a54c12155ddf1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScratchDaCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
