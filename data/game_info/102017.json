For the reboot I re-did the basic game and upgraded to Unity 5.</p><p>Links:</p><p>Ludum Dare Mini LD page</p><p>Twitter: @emotiontheory</p><p>Site: emotiontheory.com</p><p>Blog: emotiontheory.tumblr.com</p><p>VOTE FOR IT ON STEAM GREENLIGHT!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77cb2212b115049e27b67223b0258a21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Emotion Theory"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
