Your small band of survivors has\u00a0survived so far by rationing what was left, but now water is running\u00a0out, and with the temperatures rising rapidly, you have no choice but\u00a0to make for the city.</p>\n<p>Heatwave pits the player against the board in a race against time. It plays like a board game, with a roll of the die starting each turn. Cards are drawn from the event deck, and the player must weather the events and keep as many party members alive as possible until they reach the goal.\u00a0 With 10 unique characters and a variety of events, Heatwave is sure to have the player coming back for more!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the June/July Jackpot Jam, following the \"Heatwave\" theme!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac1e22f6a63d620c073cc2f5e79952e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gameslee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
