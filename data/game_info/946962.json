to the point of being ignorant and slightly prejudiced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aka Manfred Whiteleir Jr.,\u00a0</strong><strong>Son of Manfred Whiteleir the 3rd,\u00a0\u00a0</strong><strong>King of\u00a0 the protagonist's homeland</strong></p>\n<p>While aristocratic circles paint a picture of him\u00a0as someone who continues his handsome and diplomatic father's legacy,\u00a0he is actually a shockingly snobbish and arrogant young man,\u00a0\u00a0unpleasant both inside and out.</p>\n<p>A self-proclaimed 'history lover' and 'Whiteleir's biggest patriot ever',\u00a0he seems to be in disagreement with his father about something important,\u00a0which causes him to hate the King with passion.</p>\n<p>Even looking definitely unhealthy, he possesses an unusual dose of life power\u00a0and deadpan charisma which wins some people over despite everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Son of allied king Carthage Almar</strong></p>\n<p>Manfred's oldest friend and closest confidant,\u00a0who seems to provide some wit and mental challenge to the Prince\u00a0without outshining him or insisting on his own superiority.</p>\n<p>Despite his Kingdom's reputation of being fearsome,\u00a0he keeps in the shadow,\u00a0showing modesty and asceticism\u00a0that is more typical for a commoner than a prince.</p>\n<p>That would make him seem almost saint-like,\u00a0if not for his gift for lying and unexpected physical strength\u00a0that hint at his true nature being much rougher than he shows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Son of allied King Nestor Mundi</strong></p>\n<p>Growing up in his faraway homeland\u00a0and only knowing about other kingdoms through adventure novels\u00a0his father allowed him to read,\u00a0he is charmingly enthusiastic yet absolutely clueless.</p>\n<p>That's why he constantly seeks 'guidance' and 'advice' from others,\u00a0most notably Manfred himself, who patronizes him as some kind of 'pet'.</p>\n<p>While most of his antics can be dismissed as childish and even considered cute,\u00a0sometimes one can't help feeling there is more to him than meets the eye.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nephew of allied King Emil Sanguine</strong></p>\n<p>The only prince in Manfred's circle who actually experienced\u00a0 war,\u00a0he is prone to cynicism and doesn't hold back when it comes to his opinion of all present.</p>\n<p>Denying all noble ideals as unimportant,\u00a0he instead tries to imitate average soldiers in their primitive mannerisms and attitudes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This, combined with his love of shocking remarks and alcohol,\u00a0can make him a brilliant jokester but also an incredibly obnoxious person.</p>\n<p>Reveling in his apparent 'corruption',\u00a0he supposedly 'doesn't care about anything anymore',\u00a0which sounds both tragic and slightly na\u00efve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>********************</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>\n<p>GENRE: VISUAL NOVEL</p>\n<p>PLATFORM: Windows</p>\n<p>WRITER/artist: SaintAtomique</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DEMO F.A.Q</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How much of the finished game is within the demo?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Very little, about 1% percent. It is not even a considerable part of the main route. And there are still 4 character routes, which are slightly longer than the main.</p>\n<p><strong>How well-tested is the game?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This demo is still in development stage. It was tested on a very basic level\u00a0so please consider it before playing. Can absolutely be slightly buggy and contain typos or\u00a0 grammar mistakes. Please notify me about the bugs or mistakes\u00a0you encounter in the comments.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Will the finished game have music?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>YES</strong>. But the demo won't have a soundtrack because before finishing\u00a0universal character themes that will play throughout the game, the main route and four character routes must be finalized.</p>\n<p><strong>How much romance can we expect later?</strong></p>\n<p><em>(Beware of very light spoilers below)</em></p>\n<p>There is a small\u00a0\u00a0romantic element to basically all routes but it's additional to the main plot of these routes which isn't romance (and romance here also can be avoided, for the most part).\u00a0 Be warned, what each character defines as 'romance' also may vary, and considering the shocking political events they are involved in, this may mean...many unexpected revelations for you. Depending on what kind of person you are, these dramatic events may delight or horrify you.\u00a0\u00a0 This isn't a dating sim or sex game by any means<strong>\u00a0since it contains zero nudity or sex scenes</strong>!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c659dc2abec38db529ac6ccd5a6b2024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atomkinema"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
