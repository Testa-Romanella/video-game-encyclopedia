Her favorite game, the only game besides mine that she would rave about, was Balloon Kid. She used to always make this little hissing sound at me too. It really only made sense to make a game with the theme \"Moving On\" about her as a snake with a balloon- free to float wherever now. Much love, mama. \u270c</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity3D</li><li>Blender 2.8</li><li>Bolt</li><li>ToonyColorsPro2</li><li>Cinemachine</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T05:46:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ecb8be4382134651428a339f60b6202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SugarSores"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
