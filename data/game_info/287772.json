The Theme was \"Home\".</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a first-person, hide and sneak game where the player must befriend the monster, ChubbyChoco, before he returns back home under your bed. <br/>To become friends with ChubbyChoco, the player needs to pet him when close enough to the monster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW-TO-PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD/Arrow Keys to walk around</p>\n<p>Rotate Camera with KEYS Q/E</p>\n<p>When close enough, you'll see a GREEN HAND pop up that indicates you are close enough. Use your Left-Mouse Click to pet him.</p>\n<p>You can only PET ChubbyChoco when he is CALM. He should be smiling and making a laughing sound when calm.</p>\n<p>When he is STARTLED, he'll GASP, and when he is SCARED, he'll make an EEK sound. You need to be careful moving too much towards ChubbyChoco when he is STARTLED/SCARED. You can still move, but move too much, he'll disappear and go to a new respawn location.</p>\n<p>When you PET him, he'll eventually POOF away to a new location.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Players:</strong> One</p>\n<p><strong>Time Limit:</strong> 500 Seconds <br/><strong>Game Developed by:</strong> Monster Buddies</p>\n<p><strong>Out Motto: </strong>\"A Game Made by Monsters for Monsters\" <br/><strong>Team Members Include:</strong><br/>- Kelsey Coffman: Level Designer/Programmer/Audio<br/>-Eunice Lim: Designer/Programmer<br/>-Allyson Campos: 2D Art/2D Animations\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T03:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f7238d2fbc96a33717bfdc326391b9f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haiyoooo", "LightinCloud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
