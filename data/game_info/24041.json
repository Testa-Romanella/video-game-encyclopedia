You can challenge another player in \n      Stroke, Match and Tournament modes. Play on three fantasy courses in the \n      USA, the UK and Japan and try to win a million dollars. Make sure you \n      keep an eye on the wind and distance to the hole before selecting your \n      club, or else you'll be racking up some high scores - which is exactly \n      what you don't want to do in this game. Whether you're a beginner or an \n      experienced golfer, NES Open Tournament Golf is perfect for those days \n      when you just can't get to the local golf course.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
