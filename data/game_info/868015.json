Your help is badly needed.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>As our heart grows stronger, it starts building and nourishing the organism. Yet peace is short lived as malicious entities begin to crawl towards it. First only a few appear, so you might just be able to up the organisms defences in time. But that won\u2019t stop them for long. More are coming\u2026</em>\n</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><em>Skip this section if you want to find out yourself :)</em>\n</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>Try to get the organism to survive as long as possible!</p>\r\nSurviving\r\n<ul><li>Starting with a center heart node, the organism will grow in ten second-cycles. Each cycle, the organism produces and distributes\u00a0<em>energy</em>\u00a0that it requires to grow and sustain itself.\r\n</li><li>If its energy balance is positive, the organism will develop new nodes. Those will continue to grow every cycle until they reach their full size. You can develop them into different types with special abilities: \u2013 green nodes produce additional energy every cycle \u2013 purple nodes can shoot projectiles against incoming enemies. Each shot requires energy. \u2013 each node\u2019s type is final and cannot be reassigned.\r\n</li><li>Newly assigned nodes undergo a construction period before they are operational. This process requires a fixed amount of energy. The more energy the organism can provide per cycle, the shorter the construction period.\r\n</li><li>defensive nodes have a limited field of view: they will only attack enemies within their respective radius:\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nDamage and death\r\n<ul><li>More and more enemies will attack the organism over time. Nodes hit by attacks will shrivel and die if they take to much damage. The game ends if the heart node is destroyed.\r\n</li><li>To avoid this, you will need to fend off the attackers. A red indicator will show you, where the next wave will spawn.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:36:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/150d729bcfd1da46336a552107fe423d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["BlackLambert"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
