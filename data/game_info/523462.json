Cheers! &lt;3<br/></p>\n\n<p>It is a skill game where you have to provide inputs when required while keeping the charge, inspired by the mechanics of Guitar Hero-style but with a little twist. <br/><strong>The playable web version is has a sound issue, and has been removed temporarily.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The controls</strong> are your whole keyboard\u00a0(letters), Space bar to charge, and Esc to restart the game, going back to the menu.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: There is currently a engine bug related to the launcher, it will stay open after closing the game, and it might produce a visual glitch when startin gthe game again. To prevent this if you exited the game, close the launcher and reopen it\u00a0from the executable.<br/>I will be reporting that to the engine devs and hope it's fixed soon.</p>\n<p>Videos:<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0\r\nAgain, I hope you enjoy my first ever released project. Please show it some love and thank you for giving it a try :)\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>If you have any suggestions, be it gameplay/possible improvements, missing tags or a better category for the game, or anything else, please comment down below.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a3353c3ca2e5d1fe230ac5d5d50f73f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["csf91"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
