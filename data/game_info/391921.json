There are too many puzzle games we\u2019ve played over the years that I\u2019ve never beat. We have terrible attention spans so mechanics can\u2019t get too complicated. And those puzzles that take twenty minutes to figure out never leave you satisfied because the next level uses a brand new set of rules that stop you for another twenty minutes. All the Horses hopes to give you puzzles you can fly through. Each level is relatively small, so trial and error does not trip you up too much. At least that\u2019s the hope.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Solve puzzles!</p>\n\n<p>Have others animal\u00a0friends help you out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abaa38bd08cb31324428483861d20f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["OneThousandMarkers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
