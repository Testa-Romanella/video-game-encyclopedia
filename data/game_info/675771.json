{"id": 675771, "slug": "restarted", "name": "ReSTARTed", "name_original": "ReSTARTed", "description": "<p>Our game is about an Archer who is looking to defeat the three bosses without getting hit. Our idea was if they get hit, they become \"unstable\". The only character this applies to is the last one, they will not be able to see much around them if they are touched.</p>\n<p>This game started as a hudband and wife duo but had a lot of complications throughtout the process. The first day after working for 12 hours straight, the engine failed us, making us lose all our progress. Getting back into it Saturday, we pushed all day long only to discover at midnight we could not execute the game due to licensing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Realizing Monday was around the corner we asked for support from our programmer friend. We restarted everything... again, we also remade the characters and animations as well. We worked from Saturday midnight until moments before 6pm Monday. As a bunch of our ideals for instability were not able to be conveyed through our game, we did still have a ton of unstability with the making of our game, hense the name ReSTARTeD.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed our game and we hope to be able to bring more games at the next Game Jam Thank you Lundum Dare for the opportunity to be unstable and bring you ReSTARTeD.</p>\n<p>Artist - Chris and Celeste Sinclair | Programming - Ryan Armstrong | Music By J.T.
