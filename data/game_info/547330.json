You control Pat, a soldier on their first deployment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This demo represents only the introduction of the game, culminating in a show-down with a foe that you are unable to defeat with your current abilities. In future iterations your character will wake up in an infirmary after this confrontation, and the rest of the world will be yours to explore. There were many features that we couldn't fit into this version due to time constraints, but expect to see more in the near future. For now, we hope you enjoy the playable demo.</p>\n<p>Known isses: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>The combat encounter on the first main road sometimes ends instantly after starting. </li><li>When the hero character uses \"stab\" it displays as \"chop\" in the notification area.</li><li>There isn't a clean way to exit from the program from anywhere but the opening menu.</li><li>The latest build forces a specific ratio and resolution until we can sort out proper scaling.</li><li>Field of view and resolution wasn't considered during early testing, and as a result, the UI elements display inconsistently at various resolutions. The player is also able to see more of the scene than was intended at larger resolutions.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/9357edd80636254375f3e2eba8dae24c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ian Douglass - Trashwizz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
