After walking myself through the BASin manual and tinkering with a few games, I had a firm understanding of the language. This is a fairly simple game where you collect gold and avoid the enemy. It plays a lot like PacMan and is based off of an example located in the ZX Spectrum Coding Club book. I had a lot of fun learning this language.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70cd58c9f58131433dee4040cc177342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Muscles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
