Developed using another cool fantasy console - Lowres NX.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Our hero is the ordinary box. Even his name is Mr.Box. He start on a journey in the miracle land, where always is raining of colorful blocks. Mr.Box is a big fan of collecting these falling blocks. But it's the dangerous journey. Many enemies and even bosses stay on his way.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>It's an arcade like in 80-xx. For clear each stage you need to beat the target of score points (Goal) in a time limit. Mr.Box collect colorful blocks right into himself. Note that he have the open top (as usual for boxes), so try catch the blocks considering this. Mr.box can carry three blocks. If these blocks are the same color, they turn in some score points.  Remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 green blocks = 20 score points,</li>\n<li>3 blue blocks = 30 score points,</li>\n<li>3 red blocks = 40 score points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also bonus blocks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"X\" - rises score,</li>\n<li>\"T\" - time bonus,</li>\n<li>\"L\" - a piece of heart. 4 pieces of heart = full heart (the extra life).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If is the wrong combination in the box or you need beat some enemies, you can shot with the blocks. Also beware evil blocks, don't try catch them.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nKeyboardGamepad\r\nmove:LEFT,RIGHT\ud83e\udc70 \ud83e\udc72\r\nuse vertical doors:UP,DOWN\ud83e\udc71 \ud83e\udc73\r\nshot with blocks:Z or XA or B\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>5 locations (each contains 5 stages)</li>\n<li>12 type of enemies</li>\n<li>The Boss in each \"n - 5\" stage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>P.S.
