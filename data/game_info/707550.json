I wanted the player to be fully incorporeal when using the ghosting mode so they can pass through all objects and glide like a ghost would, but I kept running into problems. So I included it as a toggle but be warned it can cause some unexpected results at times.</p>\n<p>Bugs I am aware of:</p>\n<ul><li>Unfortunately as hard as I tried I just could not get my WebGL build to work.</li><li>The player's weapon gets randomly unequipped once in a while.
