Gameplay is reminiscent of the point-n'-click adventure game classics such as \"The Dig\" or \"Chronomaster\", as well as the more recent titles such as \"Primordia\". The game puts equal emphasis on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling on the one hand, and problem solving and challenging puzzles on the other. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>K'NOSSOS </strong>plays like most of the classic titles in the genre. PC, viewed from 3rd person, traverses the locations presented in side-view. Using a classic third person interface, the player is able to interact with the world through a player character (PC) avatar. Left mouse click is used for moving and interactions, and the Right mouse click is used for examining objects further. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>K'NOSSOS </strong>features:<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 classic point-n'-click interface<br/>\u2022 abstract 2D expressionist style reminiscent of the art of Wassily Kandinsky<br/>\u2022 intricate dark sci fi storyline<br/>\u2022 non-linear gameplay<br/>\u2022 cross-genre experimental soundtrack</p>\n<p><strong>K'NOSSOS</strong> is developed by <strong>Svarun Entertainment</strong> in the WME Engine, with PC version being the main objective of the team at this point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/204109d59cff2fa6ad9bbef57084ceb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Svarun Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
