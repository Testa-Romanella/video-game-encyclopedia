To be honest it\u2019s our first jam and we happy to show you our game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We want to tell you an economy simulator-driven story about corn tree. This tree is the only one tree in the world that can produce food so our citizen believe that it\u2019s almost a god!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Suddenly Corn Tree became covered with mysterious buds and we believe it will definitely bloom soon. Keeping it alive has become the number one mission. When the Tree will spread its seeds - the whole world will be saved from starving (I\u2019m not talking about oxygen balance and other pros of Corn Trees).\u00a0</p>\n<p>So don\u2019t pass by - join the game and together we will grow this corn tree!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to complete the five-year plan in 72 hours, if you know what I mean;)</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S. if you don't do this your tree will wither and dry up.
