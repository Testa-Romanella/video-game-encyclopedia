HOWEVER, it turns out wizards are much cooler. So here was my attempt at making that game. Unfortunately there's no enemy AI or anything, so the game is mostly just a demo of what COULD be done. </p><p>You can type in \"tweets\" like:</p><p> <em>\"@BlueWizard move east,west.@RedWizard cast fire\"</em> </p><p>and then see the command play out. The game is over when one of the wizards gets hit by a spell.</p><p>I'm pretty pleased with the delivery at least, I think this time around I focused to much on making it look decent and not enough on getting the gameplay complete/fun. But the core is there, so I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25cede5c1bb3cc80e5f02fd0aade7382.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Neil Sveri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
