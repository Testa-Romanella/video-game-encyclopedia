There are 4 different classes to choose from, and they each get different powerups during the game. Try to get a higher score than your opponent by clearing the screen first. There are quite a few levels, so play until you get bored I\u00a0guess!</p>\n<p>I think this was the first game I\u00a0worked on in Unity. It was a student project for a game design course, developed as a team of 4. Overall not too bad for our first attempt, and I\u00a0definitely learned a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05f/05fc2b4ce23740cc99f2bfbaf99826d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt Mrazik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
