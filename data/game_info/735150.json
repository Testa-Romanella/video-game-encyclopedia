{"id": 735150, "slug": "arabricks", "name": "Arabricks", "name_original": "Arabricks", "description": "<p><strong>Recall Arabic vocabulary and then try to spell the words with Arabic alphabet blocks.\u00a0</strong>For beginner learners of Arabic, it is difficult to know precisely where letters occurs in words because you don't\u00a0know which vowel sounds are included and which are omitted. Arabricks gets around this difficulty by using the rules of\u00a0\"hang man\". Guess a letter and you will be shown all the places in occurs in the word you are spelling. You aren't limited to how many letters you guess, though, so you\u00a0can't fail. And, because you are using alphabet blocks that show letters only\u00a0in their isolated forms, you can\u00a0concentrate on the phonics.</p>\n<p><strong>This version of Arabricks comes preloaded with 63 vocabulary words but you can add hundreds more with the easy to use\u00a0Add Word wizard.</strong> To get Arabic audio for all the words you add, I recommend the incredible resource\u00a0SoundOfText.com.\u00a0 You will need to convert the .mp3 files to .wav files, though. For that, I recommend Switch Sound File Converter. </p>\n<p>The Arabic alphabet block images used in this game are from tes.com. Some Arabic sound files are by Elena Honor; the rest are from SoundOfText.com.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e3a431dff8b392cd72f5e9385474725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H.H.Magoo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
