Initially he has only three plantations of different sizes. Each of them presents a level of difficulty, and the biggest plantation is the one with the most water pipes. These pipes must be set in the correct position, so that the irrigation system can start working.<br/><br/>The kitten can also choose what to plant. It should be aware that the yield of each crop can vary. So it is smart to choose to plant what has a higher selling price.<br/><br/>At the end of each crop, the planting generates money. Kitten will use this money to fulfill his dreams as a cat, and finally have a large farm at his disposal.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:29:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfe/bfef5383c0e5d4f11d1bb25cd2a65736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minicactus Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Minicactus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
