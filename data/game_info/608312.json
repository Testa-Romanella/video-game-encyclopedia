The current demo was made in 48 hours. Everything was created by myself.</p>\n<p>I took this game jam as an\u00a0opportunity to learn how to effectively use scriptable objects. I created an entire dialogue system using them. While I believe I can improve my methods in the future I definitely think I learned a lot and have a much better understanding of scriptable objects in Unity.</p>\n<p>The game was heavily inspired by Stardew Valley. In the future, I have plans to add more planets, combat, more friendly NPCs, and actually add a hangar to the ship! I had a lot of fun working on this project and I definitely want to stick with it!</p>\n<p>One issue I encountered that I plan to fix is the screen sizing. It is supposed to be running in full screen, HD if possible. However, for some reason, the left and right sides of the screen\u00a0seem to be clamped which throws off the resolution. I have not had this issue before in previous projects but I intend to fix it in the future.</p>\n<p>Also you must close the game with\u00a0task manager because it is not a game jam game if it has a quit button ;) But I intend to add that as well at some point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e006f26feeb8956fc78977ba9aaa5a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Andersen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
