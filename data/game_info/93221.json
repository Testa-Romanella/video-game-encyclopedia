Should you fight him? Heck yeah, you do! We can't just sacrifice the world like that!</p>\n<p><strong>Take a silly journey with four different characters including:</strong><br/><strong>King</strong>: a ordinary swordsman with the power to control fire and explosions<br/><strong>Naira</strong>: a creepy, weeaboo stalker with a gun<br/><strong>Faliyos</strong>: a handicapped, ice-cold fist fighter<br/><strong>Alen</strong>: a disinterested Taekwondo student that somehow got dragged into the conflict</p>\n<p>Each character has a different set of movesets and attributes that definitely requires a different playstyle for each.</p>\n<p><strong>Get creative with combos</strong><br/>This game is not limited to just a basic one button combo! Mix it up with the use of assist partner summons, skill attacks, smash attacks, aerial attacks, and unleash attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>You are not alone</strong><br/>In times of danger, not everyone has to be super heroes. Save citizens, and some might even help fight with you! Because you are fighting together with others, you are not limited to a single character to use. You can switch to any character at any time by using the SHIFT key. </p>\n<p><strong>UPDATES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>May 5, 2017 v1.0.0 - Full game released!
