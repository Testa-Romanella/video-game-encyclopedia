Done during the end of year 1 of school. It was a culmination of three different subjects worth of work including, Narrative, Programming and 3D Modeling.</p>\n<p>It is made for 1920 x 1080 res and is a windows build. You'll have to download the .zip, extract and run the .exe file.</p>\n<p>I designed and programmed everything, made all the models and the narrative. The sounds I ripped from various places. Credit goes to whoever owns them, I sadly didn't record what I got from where.</p>\n<p>Anyway hope you enjoy my first ever project!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm always looking to improve, and even though It is extremely unlikely that I will ever return to this project, please leave any C&amp;C in the comments section!</p>\n<p>Cheers Mates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T05:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d387bd7fc9ab698c8e98fddccfda6a74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Spinks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
