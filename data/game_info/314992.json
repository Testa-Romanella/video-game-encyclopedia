They all warned you not to get involved with the Dirty Cash Cult, but you didn\u2019t listen. Also, you were in way over your head and weren\u2019t able to come through on your promises. Now they\u2019re demanding payment by 7 o\u2019clock.. You\u2019ve got to make some major cash fast. Nobody makes a fool of Penny Arcane! You\u2019ve heard tell of an underground den close-by that\u2019s crawling with treasure-hoarding monsters. It\u2019s risky, but what other option do you have? Time to pay back your debt!<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Penny Arcane is a rogue-like dungeon crawler where you play as a coin mage named Penny. Battle your way through the randomly generated dungeon acquiring quirky items and gold. Use your powerful coin magic wisely at the cost of health, but with the ability to heal with coins. Find shops, ATMs, and chests along the way and reach the end to fight a challenging boss with three heads. Be wary though, that doggo isn\u2019t the only thing that bites!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cast your vote for us in Ludum Dare #44!</strong></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/penny-arcane<br/></p>\n\n<p>Listen to the soundtrack here on BandCamp</p>\n<p>=== Controls ===<br/>WASD - Run<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Shift - Dash<br/>Mouse - Aim<br/>F - Interact<br/>Left Mouse Button - Fire!<br/>Right Mouse Button - Angry Fireball<br/>Q - Dazzle<br/>E - Coin Shield<br/>R - Make It Rain<br/>Escape - Pause Menu</p>\n<p><strong>BUG FIXES:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Fixed teleporter text disappearing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Fixed enemy healthbars disappearing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Fixed damage text disappearing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Stats now display properly at end of game</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Added video resolution options to address bug for mouse only moving in top left of screen and enabled full screen toggle with alt+enter</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>=== Contributors ===<br/>Code: Patrick Hill / Aron Hommas / Kevin Ulrich<br/>Art: Sam Bragg<br/>Music &amp; Sound: Tristan Deniet<br/>Script: Tristan Deniet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc5/cc53852c1cad526db45f8cf614ffae6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cileth", "SamStallion"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
