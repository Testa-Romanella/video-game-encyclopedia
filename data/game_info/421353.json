As you begin to reconnect with these old friends, they ask to perform those secret handshakes you taught them oh so long ago- only problem is, you don\u2019t remember a single secret handshake maneuver. It\u2019s your job to awkwardly fake your way through these secret handshakes and conversations, to preserve the vulnerable feelings of your old friends.</em></strong>\n\n\r\nNote: This is the first 10 minutes or so of a full game that's coming out later this year.
