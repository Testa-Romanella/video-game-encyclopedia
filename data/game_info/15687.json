It\u2019s a short story, and a linear experience, that attempts to show, what it might be like, to not be a center of a story driven game. Players are led to believe, that they are to embark on a great heist in a mansion with tigers and emeralds involved, but there\u2019s a catch. They WILL play the actual game, but at the moment there\u2019s another player going through the heist, and narrator, voiced by the comedian Simon Amstell, asks the actual player has to wait for their turn. Or help the narrator with some minor tasks, because the entire staff seems to be on strike.<br />\nMassively story driven, Dr. Langescov allows really minor interactions, but it\u2019s to be expected from the small complimentary game by the designer of Stanley Parable. Players will be shown the backstage and preparations, that are made in order for people to experience the heist and all inner workings of seemingly interactive experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a4511b693e10e282463b5904a2f450.jpg", "website": "http://crowscrowscrows.com/", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 1530, "beaten": 334, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 16, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 312, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 317, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Crows Crows Crows"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Crows Crows Crows"], "esrb_rating": null}
