A facility of some kind, perhaps? And surely enough, you want to get out. Oh, there it is. A sign with an arrow and word \"OUT\" written on it. This must be the way out, isn't it?</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Arrow keys to move left and right</li><li>Z to jump</li><li>X to shoot</li><li>Enter to restart current stage</li></ul><p>NOTE: If you're stuck, try restarting the current stage! (Really helpful for the final level)</p><p>So, this is the first time I've ever joined a game jam and oh boy, the experience is completely thrilling! Creating everything from scratch, in a time span of 7 days. I always want to participate in Ludum Dare, but when the time comes, I chickened out because I just can't create art and program in 48 hours. But GBJAM, with more relaxing rules, makes me think: \"Oh, maybe this is doable!\"</p><p>And yet, I barely finished my game in time, even though there's still almost no animation, no sound whatsoever, and only a few levels. Lots of gameplay elements have been cut (like a map and inventory system). If only I dedicate more time to the game, then I might be able to finish it. Still, I have plenty of fun joining this jam: First time making a game for a jam, first time drawing pixel arts, first time using Godot (this engine is amazing; the editor is solid, the animation engine has an UI and really powerful).</p><p>The last minutes when jam is about to end were nerve-wrecking. I finished the game pretty late, so I didn't have many time to create an entry. I have zero experience with itch.io, so I was stunned with all the fields I have to fill to upload my game. Then came the building process. Godot is new to me too, and I didn't know how to build the game. And even after everything was done, I still thought that my game hasn't participated in the jam, followed by even more googling and the clock was ticking. Until I went to my game's page, and I saw the badge says: \"Rate submission for GBJAM 5\", that I felt relief.</p><p>In the future, I might work more on this game to make it closer to what I have in mind. Thank you for playing!</p><p>Made with Godot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/243efc929ba19e4c7f3d9baefd5d09de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Oggzie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
