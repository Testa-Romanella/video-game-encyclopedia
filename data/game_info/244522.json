Thoughts of money and loot being buried in these lonesome graves are too much for Mr. Krabs to resist. But little does he know, that The Hash Slinging Slasher is still on his tail, a crazed Old Man Jenkins wanders this boneyard at night and The Flying Dutchman lingers around these parts when no one is around.</p>\n<p>With shovel in hand, will you be able to dig up all these graves in this gloomy grave yard and obtain all the money in the world? Or will you be caught by these ghouls and die a brutal death? Find out, in this free expansion for 3:00 AM at The Krusty Krab!</p>\n<p>For anyone wondering, yes, this is technically a standalone DLC for 3:00 AM at The Krusty Krab, it isn't exactly a sequel, it's more like what Dishonored 2 did, where they released a standalone DLC continuing the story of what happened after the events of Dishonored 2. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this silly yet spooky new title by yours truly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/37081302aa22d42f9996f220f9b51e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
