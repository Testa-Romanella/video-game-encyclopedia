How fast can you make it to the flag at the bottom? Used A/D to move, and S to dive faster! There is a new course generated every day, so try coming back tomorrow (or changing your clock) to generate a new course!</p>\n<p>The game's time is based off of UTC, so the date displayed on the title screen might not match your computer's time.</p>\n<p>This game was designed for\u00a0Weekly Game Jam 132, where the theme was \"Deep Dive\". Admittedly, the game reuses some assets and code from my previous game, and given how quickly I made it, it's not very polished.<br/></p>\n<p>The game utilizes some collision algorithms from Jeffery Thompson (specifically line/circle), who allows them to be used in programming projects.</p>\n<p>The font used in the game is ManualPrint by Aaron D. Chand, and is free for commercial use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b62408e816b583bdf30543cf59512db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bluswimmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
