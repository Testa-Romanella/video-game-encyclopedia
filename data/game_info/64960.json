The numbers are always increasing and so is the challenge.</strong><br/><br/>Within a limited number of laps around a circle shoot a tile number at the board to connect then. When three or more and together they merge and turn into one higher number, and that's where things get tough.<br/><br/>But everything comes with a reward. The harder the challenge more experience and levels you get. With levels comes more laps and the chance to go further into the numbers. Hold lots of then tight and let the combos begin!<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES :</strong><br/><strong>*Level Up System</strong><br/><br/><strong>*Unlimited Challenget</strong><br/><br/>*Controller Support<br/><br/>*Steam Leaderboard<br/><br/>*Steam Achievements<br/><br/>While the tile number is rotating around the main circle, hit Left-Ctrl to make it attach to a slot. When three or more equal numbers are connected they will merge into a bigger number. With good strategic positing you can make combos and get a better score.<br/>Endless Mode has no lap counter and a different leaderboard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7be14bebe03a2c0a693abd2ab58f82c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 51, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["XiNFiNiTY Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OtakuMaker"], "esrb_rating": null}
