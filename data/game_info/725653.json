He decides to add defenses to make sure adventurers leave him alone, only to realize that the added defenses and riches attract more adventurers to his home, resulting in an endless cycle of power for the shopkeeper.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Standard Tower Defense Rules<br/>When a wave is not currently going on, use the buttons at the bottom to select a defense to place.
