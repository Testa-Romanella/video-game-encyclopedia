All incredibly sub-par music, SFX, and sprites were created by me. Play as a young boy who must reclaim his stolen amulet from a wizard. But this won't be your ordinary run-of-the-mill adventure.\u00a0</p><p>Oh wait. Scratch that, yeah it will.<br/></p>\n<p>Jump, die, stomp, die again, and run to the right in this decidedly ordinary adventure! This game can be played either using WASD and space or using a game pad.</p>\n<p>I plan to flesh this out a lot more after the jam. I feel like it has some potential.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/775500ffc553d059d2433a720e9dc185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cap'n Procrasteus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
