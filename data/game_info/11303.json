The simplicity/complexity ratio is just right \u2013 you don\u2019t try to get too fancy but there are also enough elements that can be mixed and matched that the game stays fresh.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cLovely design and tons of content, it feels like a love letter to PopCap, and that\u2019s meant in the most complimentary ways.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI really like the art for this game. I\u2019m a big fan of the classic Universal monster aesthetic, and the game has a lot of fun with these different types of creatures.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf6bd072aac3fef08b62ce0d5a079d6.jpg", "website": "http://digitalfuturelab.com/ghostlight/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Digital Future Lab"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Functional Unicorn"], "esrb_rating": null}
