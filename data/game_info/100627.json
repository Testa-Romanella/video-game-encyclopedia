It's pretty bare boned tbh. But it's short and kinda sweet, so please give it a try if you like my humor.<br/></p><p>There will be 3 ending (the 3rd ending has 2 branches). Here's a guide to getting them </p><p>http://princess-s-pets.tumblr.com/post/14598818958...</p><p>Known bugs:</p><p>+Music files corrupted for no reason (won't stop you from playing, though)</p><p>+I know Actor5 is in there somewhere.... But I can't find him. I guess we aren't mean for each others.</p><p>Please contact me if you encounter any bugs or lagging issue. Thank you~</p><p>EDIT: DOWNLOAD'S back. I have included a version with RTP if you have fast connection and 100MB more disk space to spare just in case (The no RTP version can still run normally even with bug, though)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b93954d2b79ed990b89cec4d93ad16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["toki production"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
