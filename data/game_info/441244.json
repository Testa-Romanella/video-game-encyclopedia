The main way that I focused on exploring this topic was through the use of varying perspectives. Changes in color, camera angle and music all serve as ways to help the player see the same game in different ways, which hopefully shows them the power of perspective and the influence that it can have.</p>\n<p>Some lessons that I learned while making this game:</p>\n<p>1. Making a game with minimal art assets and text is way harder than I expected. I learned that I need to place a greater importance on making mechanics of the game important enough where they can be used to\u00a0tell a story, rather than relying on art.</p>\n<p>2. I learned about the importance of using things like color and sound to make the meaning of the game more pronounced.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 I learned the importance of perspective. Changing the camera angles helped to make the perspective aspect of the game more pronounced and made the metaphor more clear. This project taught me the importance of paying attention to my camera angles and focusing on them more when making games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Below is a link to my google drive, where you can find a video of the gameplay.</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Inh8a1gSQxMNTnMUocsl8692C-4GCr-D/view?usp=shari...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71c82a534d51b69db02691a8248791b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mjmurphy6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
