This game was called \"Halloween 2013,\" or \"Halloween Scavenger Hunt.\"<br/><br/>In 2016 I decided to update and rerelease the game with some new features.</p>\n<p>Halloween games were a tradition for me once upon a time, starting in 2008. I tried to get one made every year, even if it would be very unambitious. It started with an incredibly simple arcade-style score builder game about a guy running around a field with a shovel fighting pumpkin-headed monsters that I programmed in 4 hours. The Halloween Scavenger Hunt was the last game in the tradition, and because I had lumped on some additional ambition what should have been a 2 day project became 5 days, not releasing until November 1st.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea had started as an attempt to make a collect-a-thon where the player must evade zombies in a grave yard. This would be a score-building arcade survival game that would go on until the player is inevitably caught. I ended up expanding the scenery and soon enough I was adding more monsters and items. It became obvious that the game was going to become a scavenger hunt, and it was clear to me what I wanted the finished product to be.<br/></p>\n<p>With graphics ripped from Earthbound, Mother, and Zombies Ate My Neighbors! I designed the game around darting around and evading enemies while collecting items.<br/></p>\n<p>To this day I'm still really happy with how this game came out. Even with the borrowed graphics I feel like this is a game that expressed exactly the feel I wanted it to. It has exploration, interesting enemies, secrets, simple gameplay, and lots of variety.<br/></p>\n<p>Want to support my free games?\u00a0 I sell merchandise featuring characters and designs from some of my most well received games. Every purchase helps me to not starve on my way to releasing my next game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79e/79e3eb0e7ca51e4bfe21f3fb60ae5cbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William John Holly"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
