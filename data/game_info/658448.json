Most of this is currently already available, with work to increase this exponentially already in progress. 113 collectable pet followers are fully programmed into the game and all make use of the Pet Kennel System, however in the Demo\u00a0only the Rabbit and Sparrow\u00a0pets are\u00a0obtainable.\u00a0 - DeadFissure</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23b736461bf44bf9fc19338256906732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deadfissure"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
