I prefer being outdoors, exploring procedural landscapes, and playing with physics simulations. So here's my take on the genre.\"  </em>-SlowRiot\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>Procedurally generated terrain with procedural woodland.</li>\n<li>Realistic passage of time, with day-night and summer-winter cycle.</li>\n<li>Trees grow realistically, in real-time. Of course, that's very slow - you'd have to leave the computer running for a very long time to see it.</li>\n<li>Time is sped up 120x, so 1 second = 2 minutes in-game. A day lasts about 12 minutes, but you'd have to leave the game running for about 3 days to see the winter snow. The ball is of course very hard to find in the snow.</li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>WASD to walk,</li>\n<li>Shift to run,</li>\n<li>Space to jump (why would you need to jump on a golf course? Perhaps to leap over a short shrub...)</li>\n<li>Hold left mouse button to move arms,</li>\n<li>Hold right mouse button to move arms and head,</li>\n<li>Hold both mouse buttons at the same time to move just your head.</li>\n</ul>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>\r\n\tWritten in C++ using OpenGL. Entire 3D engine written completely from scratch just during this 7-day jam, in 4889 lines of code.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\r\nSoundtrack\r\n<p>\r\n\tMusic by Skin Walker.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nWhat people are saying about GolfXTRM\r\n<ul>\n<li> <em>\"Riot's slow decline in certainty about whether the game is a golf game or not is pretty amusing.\"</em> -Fuck This Jam official twitter </li>\n<li> <em>\"I can only seem to accidentally hit the ball the wrong way. Any tips?\" </em>-Gromange </li>\n<li> <em>\"Loving the colour pallet, looks fucking mint\"</em> -Laura </li>\n<li> <em>\"@Riot - Love the simulation. LOVE THE SIMULATION. Also golf clubs. Love them too.\"</em> -Detocroix </li>\n<li> <em>\"I liked the bit where I wanted to check the control config, so I hit esc and it exited to desktop. How very dare I?\"</em> -Jont </li>\n<li> <em>\"On the second hit when it hit it so hard that I flung my mouse into the wall it crashed shortly after :P\"</em> -Causeless </li>\n<li> <em>\"I love it! Exactly what golf games need to embody\"</em> -r0r0r0 </li>\n<li> <em>\"I was wearing headphones and the view swam like I was going to puke and the music got louder and more horrible and I got more desperate to try and hit the ball before I went deaf and then just swung over and over at the ball to try and make contact and then it crashed. 9/10.\"</em> -Egg </li>\n<li> <em>\"@Riot: take my money!\"</em> -ZapaMan </li>\n<li><em>\"GolfXTRM is what you get when you dunk a suit-coated golfer in a jar of ketamine and shove his head in a NES cartridge slot.\"</em> - http://www.hiddenexit.com/blog/2012/11/22/clubbing-under-the-influence-golfxtrm/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f16416a4ffb976fbc8928f33e104b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoxelStorm"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
