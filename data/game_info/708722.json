In this dark realm is a mountain with a conduit. As the only kind-hearted being in this realm, the player sets off on an adventure to scale the mountain. Along the way, the player can meet ghosts, ghouls, and creatures. Through the native creatures, you can unfold the history and secrets of the dark realm. Stay strong, as the dark souls are proud, strong, and degrading, willing to do what they can to destroy the hero\u2019s commitment to itself:\u00a0 save all innocent souls.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player is able two travel through an open world scene. The open-world scene is filled with cave systems, villages, mountains, and secret rooms waiting to be found. The mountain\u2019s conduit is the remains of a tower, taller than the mountain itself. The tower attracted the attention of powerful creatures all over the land. Now that it is gone merchants have claimed the mountain and its remains as their home. In the purple plaza, the player is able to converse with the merchants and explore their shops.
