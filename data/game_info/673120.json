For example, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics provide a natural understanding of the blackbody spectrum, and the Fermi theory on electronic bands of condensed matter systems has its foundation on Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>On the other hand, probability theories with quantum statistics are rarely discussed. This is a curious omission, given the close connection between classical statistics and probability theory. In this game we try to fill this gap by studying the two dice sum probability distributions in the classic game of craps, for different kind of dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>We believe that a better understanding of quantum statistics is needed for novel quantum simulations on quantum computers. The atomic world behaves like a huge number of many-faced dice, constantly being rolled and rerolled!!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Design, Programming - David Eisner</p>\n<p>Quantum - Mahnoor Fatima</p>\n<p>Music - Giovanni Palmitesta</p>\n<p>Design, Quantum -\u00a0Ioannis Theodonis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5383a03f640436c083e7f980ab4c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperStingray", "Ioannis", "maxwell042"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
