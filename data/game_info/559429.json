SHMUPs are real, they have wants, needs, emotions and goals. They're just like you and me! What awaits in your first year at Shmuppington Academy?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>A tale as old as time, this is just the first exciting chapter of this story. Will there be a chapter two? Lets be honest, probably not, that's what happens when a developer underestimates the effort in making a visual novel. And, in this case, a visual novel with fully 3D characters, animations, 3D backgrounds, branching story and choices that stay with you to the end of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Please enjoy this terrible tale of cosmic horror, murder, friendship, love\u00a0and schoolwork.</p><p>Feel free to send me your thoughts @thos_thom</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56b6dac9b10aa153a24f512e667ae835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TACS Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
