Every religion worth adhering to has this as its central tenant. And yet, the plant-like Daoins and the canine-like Arcoiri are the last two valid sentient races left.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The Mania Plague was dropped on the reptilian Mazarans by the Angel of Punishment ten seasonal cycles ago and are at risk of extinction. The subsequent coup of the government in Unity has left the island-spanning city split between its four districts, each run by a separate organization. Only the Horizon agreement between all four leaders keeps Unity intact as the last stronghold of civilization. That being said, Unity is still a bright city with many luxuries. But now more than ever it needs a stronger defense. Horizon researchers have developed a guardian crafted from technology and magic in the hopes of not only having a protector for Unity itself but also a protector for future settlements.</p>\n<p>Forbidden is a visual novel about Eiros, an Arcoiri in the top ranks of Orthrus, the criminal syndicate that pervades the island. Despite the announcement of the Guardian Initiative, he can\u2019t help but feel that more is needed to ensure sentient-kind\u2019s, and more importantly his, survival. Eiros plans on addressing directy what he believes to be the root of society\u2019s issues. The history of Opus is one of denial and cowardice, and in running away from responsibility the world only invited worse repercussions. Eiros aims to correct the actions of sentients long gone and release the imprisoned demons and the Angel of Guilt, all in a last-ditch effort to save the soul of Unity. Though, his motivations aren\u2019t all selfless, and what better way to change one\u2019s life than a good adventure?\r\n</p>\n<p>Yes, the world has fallen. But is it too late to save it?\r\n</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Hi there! I'm Helado, the writer and artist for this story/game. Forbidden is a work in progress, so if you enjoy it so far let me know and stick around for more!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T05:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3f/d3fd158b3aa5235366de227c2e368ef5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Helado"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
