Hunters have to be careful though as sometimes the prey can hunt you!<br/><br/><h3>WORLD</h3><br/>Prehistoric Hunt is played on a large island. The island has many kinds of terrain: High mountains, dense forests and open plains. The island is inhabited by multiple dinosaur species.<h3>HUNTING</h3><br/>Hunt as many dinosaurs you like (Or as long as you have equipment to do so). No regulations!<br/><br/><h3>DINOSAURS</h3><br/>Multiple dinosaur species live on the island. Some are calmer herbivores and others more aggressive carnivores. Some species also like to live in herds making finding them easier. The dinosaurs may also end up fighting each other. All of the dinosaurs can be a danger to the hunter. Beware of their keen senses!<br/><br/><h3>WEAPONS</h3><br/>Players can utilize multiple different weapons in their hunting adventure. Some weapons have more firepower, some are quicker to handle. Players will also have to take into account the shooting distance to target as the bullets start to drop on longer distances. The bullets also don't last forever.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/338f884f0061dbe88585ff8c74b83f42.jpg", "website": "https://antiproto.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antiproto"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Antiproto"], "esrb_rating": null}
