Once pressure reaches 40, you have won\u00a0the game. If the temperature ever rises to 4\u00b0 C, you lose the game.\u00a0Each turn, the temperature rises and one event card is drawn for each\u00a0player. Then players take turns and can each draw a card, play a card or\u00a0discard one for two new cards.\u00a0Players can hold a maximum of 7 cards.\u00a0Permanent cards can change the game mechanics though! Keep on playing\u00a0and learn as you go!</p>\n<p><em>Because of the time constraints of the Climate Jam, the multiplayer mode wasn't finished, the game only has a fraction of the cards it should have and there are bugs aplenty. After finishing my current project Core Defense, I shall return to this and unlock its full potential!\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c01/c017f06661e3e08d6210e9b288ba281f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ehmprah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
