The only way to escape and travel back to your home is by completing every single one of their challenges, every dangerous rage inducing stage. <br/>\r\nEach consecutive stage will become more difficult. We can guarantee that you will rage unless you can become a master at controlling your UFO. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCollect all the props to proceed to the next stage. Buy upgrades in the human's upgrade store. <br/>\r\nDestroy your ship and watch it shatter into small fragments. <br/>\r\nSome levels have more to them than just collecting props to proceed, for example, some stages might have small puzzles you must complete. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you think what I've told you so far sounds hard then your going to love this next part... <br/>\r\nThe human scientists also have specially designed super weapons to prevent you from reaching your home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you do it? <br/>\r\nCan you make it back Home?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-27T23:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/186320f36b5ba55efe68b18b7efd3f82.jpg", "website": "http://fourwingedstudio.com/", "rating": 2.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 161, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Four Winged Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Four Winged Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
