Many features, items and enemies are incomplete and everything is still subject to change. Crashes/soft-locks shouldn't be common but you might run into the occasional glitch.\u00a0 We'd love to hear your feedback in order to make this as good as possible.<br/><br/></p>\r\n****CREDITS****\r\n<p>GAME DESIGN: AMON26</p>\n<p>AI/SCRIPTING: HOLOGRAM_SAM, FEVERDREAM JOHNNY<br/></p>\n<p>QA LEAD: JAYLEN REYNOLDS</p>\n<p>LEVEL FLOW QA: DRONAROID</p>\n<p>DIALOGUE: QUINN K, RIGILPAIX</p>\n<p><strong>-VOCALS-</strong></p>\n<p>NIKKI KALPA - MOMENT</p>\n<p>FREYA - THE IMPRESARIO</p>\n<p>BETHANY BARROSO - MUSIC</p>\n<p><strong>-ADDITIONAL VOICES-</strong></p>\n\n<p>DOCTATO, ELLIFACE,DEADXMOUTH, <br/><br/>PATRICIA CHANDLER, LADY DECADE</p>\n<p>MSSALTYBONES+lil salt</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>-VIDEOS-</strong></p>\n<p>THEBEXPERSON, MSSALTYBONES,JOYSTIKNIK</p>\n<p>NICKSMADSCIENCE,DEADXMOUTH</p>\n<p><strong>-SPECIAL THANKS TO-</strong></p>\n<p>OUR FAMILIES, AUTUMNXIVY, KATIE TERRY, JUAN, LIVI,</p>\n<p>LADY DECADE, BRYCE BUTCHER, <br/>ZACH MURPHY, THE HPSX, CANTO, <br/>AND PH16 DISCORD COMMUNITIES</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00d0ac48e95afb4d5f90af7653536d29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amon Twentysix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
