In addition, few games provide an in-depth look at high school and pre-university physics. Yet, these physics puzzles can be a lot of fun, in addition to being an extremely effective way to understand abstract concepts like acceleration. In this sense, SPACE TOW TRUCK fills a void that could benefit anyone interested in science and space, but also teachers and students in high school and pre-university. I created this recreational-educational game because I believe we lack games to feel, understand and democratize high school and pre-university physics. This is why the game demo, which covers the concepts of position and displacement, is offered free of charge to anyone interested in physics (approximately 45 minutes of gameplay).<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> Use eight space and patented technologies<br/></li><li> Use an innovative self-service system developped by SPACE TOW TRUCK<br/></li><li> Enjoy a replay system with slow motion effect<br/></li><li> Get help from a mysterious \"person\" working at SPACE TOW TRUCK and find out why it is so motivated to help you<br/></li><li> Hear Soft Music<br/></li><li> Discover the Moon, with its seas, its craters and the landers that dot its surface<br/></li><li> Learn about the history of science and its evolution, with the last world dedicated to women in science<br/></li><li> Feel, understand and learn the laws of mechanics<br/></li><li> Game created by a physics teacher who worked part time for three years on this game</li></ul><br/>Whatever your emergency, SPACE TOW TRUCK have the tools to get you on your way.<br/> <br/>Happy space travels.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-10T13:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/788a4d4605e20a9c2c6282b195f9ebaa.jpg", "website": "https://spacetowtruck.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Laflamme", "ericlaflamme"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Educational", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Eric Laflamme"], "esrb_rating": null}
