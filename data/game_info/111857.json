{"id": 111857, "slug": "tradimento", "name": "Tradimento", "name_original": "Tradimento", "description": "<p>Tradimento is a short game. Around 20 minutes of gameplay and a lot of reading.</p>\n<p>Blending theater and narrative RPG, in Tradimento you are playing a play in 3 scenes. The game is an original tragedy taking place in a low-fantasy world inspired by Florence's Renaissance. The play main inspiration is Lorenzaccio by Alfred de Musset. There are several (at least 2) different endings.</p>\n<p>Your assets in the story are modeled with cards, that you can gain and spend during conversations. The story will adapt, depending on which cards you keep and which you discard.</p>\n<p>Free and open source art were massively used in this game. Everyone is credited at the end of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: the game has its flaws and is far from perfect (but is fully playable). It his meant to bring an idea to life. We made it in one month and it must be seen as a minimum valuable product rather than as a full game. If we enabled the donations, it is for the people who liked our ideas to support us and to show which ideas they liked the most. We will make real games with these ideas later on.</p>\n<p>We hope you will enjoy the game! Do not hesitate to help us by giving us your feedback here (also available at the end of the game).</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/fae816ba3178d206eb0b5edc121c0206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DualWielding"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
