So what shall it be, Space Pioneer, when you are the Captain of it all?<br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f BUILD A WONDROUS VIEW</h3><br/>Build, install and redesign your station to perfection in<strong> a full 3D view taking advantage of the spectacular visuals provided by Unreal Engine 4</strong>. Look at your creation in <strong>a 360 degrees view</strong>, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty.<br/><br/>Look at the magnificent in-game star constellations, nebulas, and planets the development team spent weeks researching to realistically provide in-game visualizations within the endless game sky.<br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\udd22 FOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT</h3><br/>Monitor and set up production cycles, resources, and their distribution. <strong>Focus either on efficiency or yield</strong>, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with <strong>an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board</strong> to help you design the best connections, nooks, and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success!<br/><br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\udcc8 ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE!</h3><br/><strong>A unique economic system</strong> provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail!<br/><br/>The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from <strong>hacker attacks to errors and malfunctions</strong> each module and its system entail in your management of the station.<br/><br/>Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so <strong>plan, execute and design to perfection</strong>!<h3>\ud83e\ude90 EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS</h3><br/>There are <strong>3 distinct campaign missions</strong> where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable, and easy to extract resources from.<br/><br/>Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enables you to focus on the two-game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to <strong>successfully fulfill its objectives. </strong><br/><br/>Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious, or have the most graphically appealing modules setup? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful!<br/><br/><h3> \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f ENDLESS DREAMS</h3><br/>You can also <strong>kick back and focus on building</strong> the greatest and either best looking or most efficient station there ever was - within either our <strong>Creative</strong> or <strong>Endless modes </strong>built especially for this purpose.<br/> <br/><strong>orbit.industries</strong> blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development.<br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\ude80 KEY GAME FEATURES \ud83d\ude80 </h3><ul><li> Full 360 degrees, 3D view of an orbital station within Unreal Engine 4<br/></li><li> An abstract 2D stylized view of management cycles and resource planning<br/></li><li> 3 Gameplay Modes: Campaign, Creative and Endless<br/></li><li> 54 Modules varieties to build and design your station with<br/></li><li> A technological tree to explore and expand</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-26T10:12:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52e/52e5bd62e6a89ff620987027f061aceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["LAB132"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Klabater"], "esrb_rating": null}
