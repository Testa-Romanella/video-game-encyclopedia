What was the original purpose of the factory and why was it shut down? To achieve complete control you will eventually need to confront and overcome the powerful machines protecting the factory's most critical resources.<br/><br/><strong>Freedom of Approach</strong> - King Machine is not a puzzle game. There are no predesigned solutions to any obstacle and you can build whatever machines you wish to overcome challenges. Whether you prefer elegant machines, baroque contraptions that barely work or sneaky hacks that bypass challenges entirely it's all fair play!<br/><br/><strong>Reuse / Repurpose</strong> - You can transport machines between locations within the factory, so if you've build some masterpiece to solve a problem you don't have to do all the work again in the next area.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f77/f77828dbf8cd6717bb99f7925963f28c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FastRam Design"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["FastRam Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
