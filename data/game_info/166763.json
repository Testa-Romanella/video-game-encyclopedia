In this game, players help their character overcome depression by making conscious decisions that will ultimately help in overcoming depression, even if their character does not want to make them.</p> It aims to give players that have never gone through depression before to gain a better understanding of it and the difficulties of overcoming it, that it is not as simple as being sad and not as easy as just deciding not to be sad. It also aims to give players that are currently struggling with depression the motivation to make the difficult decision to actively try to overcome depression, as it is a crucial first step in that process.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40e/40e476714af76514d4c0e8b765991f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Random Thoughts"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
