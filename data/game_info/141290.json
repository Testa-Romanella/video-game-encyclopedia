Shoot enemies to destroy them, and if you get hit you lose. But there's a catch. The game takes place on 4 screens at once. The screens act as a parallel worlds that you can jump between at any time, but be careful as some special enemies can ignore the boarders between the screens. See how long you can survive. </p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD or arrow keys:   Move</p><p>Left click:                      Shoot</p><p>Right click:                    Jump to another screen</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Programming: </p><p>Joseph Kester</p><p>Music:</p><p>SynthR - The Last Prophecy<br/></p><p>www.synthr.net<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60bd54cc8b6cde47c1cea7a8356f4eb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaosjoey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
