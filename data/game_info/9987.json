Each skirmish and siege will define your fate, as you vie to win your freedom from The Exiled.<br/>-Why we're creating The ExiledTo make a long story short: We love PvP but we hate having to grind for it. Doesn't matter if that grind means clicking on rocks and trees, farming rats or watching our mining lasers overheat on some asteroid. We just want to log into the game, find a friend or two and compete with an army twice our size. We want a game that takes us seriously as adults and allows us to make our own diplomatic decisions instead of throwing us in a battleground with a bunch of randomly selected \"friends\" and \"enemies\". We want a game that is constantly changing, keeping us on our toes and forcing us to get better instead of showering us with meaningless rewards and digital bauble.<br/><br/>-Meaningful PvP<ul><li>Open PvP: Engage other players in combat anywhere, anytime.<br/></li><li>Full loot: Carrying high-level equipment into combat means you risk losing it.<br/></li><li>Player-run clans: No pre-built factions.

A once peaceful and prosperous trading city turned from a multi-cultural melting pot into a stone cold dictatorship. You are on the receiving end of this societal change and together with hundreds of other misfits - criminals, political rebels and adventurers - you get exiled to a barren land -The Valley. Now you have to decide how to continue your life. Do you become a lone wanderer and live off the lands? Will you join the rebels and try to leave the valley by force? Or do you turn to your baser instincts and survive by robbing your fellow inmates?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-01T23:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b2/8b2ac7015139e3b9da11364bd808d37b.jpg", "website": "http://www.the-exiled.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 176, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 493, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fairytale Distillery"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Fairytale Distillery"], "esrb_rating": null}
