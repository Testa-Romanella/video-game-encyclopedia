The game takes place in a city\u00a0whose citizens\u00a0have\u00a0angered the gods, and players must navigate through the collapsing city to reach the top of Mount Olympus and apologize to the gods. As they progress, players will\u00a0have to navigate through the environment to find the correct path towards the pantheon. In addition to reaching the top of Mount Olympus before the city collapses, players will\u00a0encounter\u00a0pink cube NPCs who are trapped under rubble. Players have the\u00a0option\u00a0to rescue them or leave them behind to focus on reaching the top before the timer runs out.\u00a0\u00a0(Current version does not contain a timer due to it being more for exploration, but once finished the final version will feature a timer of sorts).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoid water like rivers and oceans as it will restart the level.<br/>You walk with WASD, jump with space and look around with mouse,</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.\u00a0 I do realise that I've made a big mistake by including a colliseum as it is more of a Roman structure, and I will be replacing it with a Theatre which would better fit the Greek style, this version fixes some bugs and changes some small details.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T12:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/32482ced16e55435a204e180a588e53a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dango07"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
