{"id": 108156, "slug": "pixel-planets", "name": "Pixel Planets", "name_original": "Pixel Planets", "description": "<p>At its core, this game is super simple, and outside of its core, it still is. You\u2019re a lander, a little ship that\u2019s built for landing on planetary bodies. That\u2019s all you do, you land on planets.</p>\n<p>However, this won't be made easy for you. As you land on more planets:</p>\n<p>Asteroids, ship debris, and other obstacles will start spawning in with increased frequency.</p>\n<p>The planets will start to rotate at faster speeds, or with variable changes.</p>\n<p>Planets will start to gain hazards of their own, like lava lakes or elevation changes and slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>And potentially more to come.</strong></p>\n<p>The lander will be controlled with a vertical thrust and left and right thrusts. The entire game will be set in a minimalistic style. Possibly pixel art, but we are open to changes.</p>\n<p>And honestly, that\u2019s about it. It will be a fun little mobile game. Beat your score while you sit down and play a few rounds. It\u2019s like a refreshing snack, not a full course meal.</p>\n\n<p>Currently in development by a five person team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/27266dd613f29cd757f8165478934547.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uplinked", "Anish Mendiratta", "KarMaPlaYzz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
