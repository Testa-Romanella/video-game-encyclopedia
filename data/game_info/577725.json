Rumor around town is that the vengeful Sun goddess, Sundance, was reborn into this humble village, but who could it possibly be? Tolerate the brazenness\u00a0of our favorite pink Nevo and perhaps you'll find out why the sun never seems to set in these lands... or who those giant Nevos outside of the village are!\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Or knowing Rosy, she'll probably just send you out to gather more ingredients for her recipes and threaten to\u00a0light you on fire for \"incentive\". My suggestion? Hang out with June instead. He'll bake you pies and who can say no to those?!</p>\n<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Beautiful landscapes for you to explore</li><li>Item retrieval based quest system</li><li>Relationship Trackers with Rosy and June</li><li>Villagers who can offer you some existential questions...\u00a0\u00a0or make fun of you</li><li>Rumors to consider, or not if Rosy\u2019s out to get you \u00a0</li><li>Mysterious giant Nevolians roaming the fields beyond The Village</li></ul>\n<p>Art assets: Advanced Village Pack (Unreal Marketplace), Unreal Engine Hour of Code<br/></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Tribe of Noise<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T10:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74ab6844e611d3eb2d8a2f1c19f1b0d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thorontaur", "pichuus", "meganyyu", "annyen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
