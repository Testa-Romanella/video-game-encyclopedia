Mysterious AI entities have erased your memories and put you in a minimalistic simulation in which keeping your sanity is your main objective. Prevent AIs from accessing the remains of your mind and explore the mysterious world for a chance of survival. Beware of the night as it won't take long for them to gain control over your last thoughts...</p>\n\n<p>Due to inherent flaws in Unity's Render Pipeline, it was unfortunately impossible to build our project. Our submission will therefore resume to the source code as Unity Project. Thank you for your comprehension.</p>\n\n<p>This jam was actually our first one and oen week didn't suffice to implement every planned mechanic for our gameplay. Weapon pickups, bullet limits, crafting, elevators, drones, detailed AI models and pathfinding represent a small amount of the features that could be added to improve our first version of 'Within' ; please appreciate the fact that it is only a prototype and a lot of work still has to be done. Nonetheless, thanks for playing and for giving us a much appreciated feedback on our work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c9c5b3c96fb6e123665f673eb8d248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cyruspellet"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
