It was developed over 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2017.</p><p>The aim is to place satellites in orbit around planets in order to bounce radio waves between them from your home planet to a mysterious alien UFO at the edge of the solar system. Position satellites in order to navigate your transmission through a maze of asteroids that will interrupt the signal. Use as few satellites as possible, as using too many could scramble the message and offend the aliens!</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Pharez Vitalis - Programming</p><p>Lee Kempton - Programming</p><p>Rudi Prentice - Programming and Sound</p><p>Natalia Patkiewicz - Game Art</p><p>Jonathan Brimble - Game Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08727f95961dad976d01acc6bb54f47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Loaded Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
