Each card, is essentially, a traditional bingo card\u00a0with a 5x5 layout.\u00a0 Instead of the normal range of possible values found in traditional bingo, each card will contain every number from 1-25, in a preconfigured lay out.\u00a0 <strong>Your goal</strong> is to land the pinballs in the numbered holes on the playfield to create a line of 3, 4 or 5 numbers on the bingo card.\u00a0 If successful, you will be paid a predetermined amount for the card, where you have \"hit\" or landed in the correct holes to make line of \u00a03 or more numbers (the numbers must be touching each other in order to count).\u00a0</p>\n\r\n#\u00a0 Game Details:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n<strong>Starting a game</strong>\n<p>Currently a max amount of\u00a010 credits is required\u00a0 to play a full featured game. You can play a game with only one credit, but\u00a0for each additional credit you insert, you will\u00a0increase your overall odds/payout for that single game.\u00a0 This\u00a0is further described in\u00a0the\u00a0list below, which explains what is unlocked per credit:</p>\n<em>Credit(s) Inserted</em><em>Unlocks</em><strong>1</strong>Inserting\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Credit #1</strong>\u00a0will unlock and enable the first card for play/payout.<strong>2...6</strong>Each additional\u00a0<strong>Credit</strong>, up until\u00a0<strong>Credit #6</strong>,\u00a0will unlock the next card in sequence. It is important to understand that\u00a0each card has a different number layout, as well as different payout amounts.\u00a0 Card 1 has the lowest payout amounts, while Card 6 has the highest payout amounts (exact payout amounts for each card can be found at the end of this post)<strong>7...8</strong>Without\u00a0<strong>Credit #7 or #8</strong>, the only diagonal lines that are possible to score on, are the diagonal lines that make up the center X shape of that card.. However with these credits, you can score any on any diagonal line (whether it be 3-in-line or 4-in-a-line) found on that card.\u00a0 More specifically,\u00a0<strong>Credit #7</strong>\u00a0unlocks this feature for Cards 1, 2 &amp; 3, while\u00a0<strong>Credit #8</strong>\u00a0Unlocks this feature for Cards 4, 5 &amp; 6. This feature, when active, shows the red box in the bottom right corner of each card with the text \"Diagonal\".<strong>9...10</strong><strong>Credit #9 - #10</strong>\u00a0are, as you might imagine, very important to your success and profit\u00a0as pinball hero.\u00a0 These credits will unlock a feature called \"Magic Number\", specifically,\u00a0<strong>Credit #9</strong>\u00a0will unlock this for Cards 1, 2 &amp; 3 and\u00a0<strong>Credit # 10</strong>\u00a0will unlock this for Cards 4, 5 &amp; 6.\u00a0 The magic number feature, if active, chooses a random number from 5 possible numbers to be that games magic number. This happens prior to shooting the first ball, allowing you to change your \"best set\" of numbers to aim for.\u00a0 There are only 5 possible magic numbers: 1, 7, 9, 21 or 25.\u00a0 For each card that has this feature enabled, there will be a purple box to the right of that card, which is also where you will\u00a0see the current\u00a0magic number that has been chosen for that game.\u00a0 If you land a ball in same number hole as the magic number, you will notice your final payout will be doubled! This is an essential\u00a0feature for any real \"try-hards\" out there.\r\n<p>Additionally:</p>\r\n\r\nAfter Credit #10 is inserted, no more credits will be accepted, <br/><br/>After any amount of credits are inserted,\u00a0you can start the game \r\nor cancel/refund \r\nNote:\u00a0Cancel will return all credits you may have inserted\r\nat this time you can not remove individual credits inserted.\r\n<br/> There is also a button which provides an easy way to\u00a0automatically \r\ninsert any remaining credits, until you've reached the maximum \r\nof 10 credits. This is a good way to ensure a full featured game, \r\nwithout having to manually insert\u00a0 each individual credit.\r\n\r\nRandom Occurring Features:\r\n<p><em>Regardless</em> of how many credits are inserted. there are two additional features which may be activated,\u00a0which is decided\u00a0randomly, prior to\u00a0shooting the first ball of that game.\u00a0These two features may be activated fully at the game start, or they may activate a \"roll-over\" button found on the playfield, that when hit will fully activate that feature.</p>\r\n[ Notice: Currently the UI does not clearly show whether that\u00a0feature is active or needs to be activated via roll-over button.\u00a0 If you see that the roll over button is brightly-colored that means it is not fully activated and requires you to maneuver\u00a0the pinball in a way to\u00a0\"roll-over\" the corresponding\u00a0button, which will then\u00a0fully activate that feature]\r\n<p>If the features, which are shown on the left of each card, are not active at all during that game &amp; can not be activated, the feature will show as \"disabled\"/grayed out.\u00a0 If the feature requires the roll-over button to activate, or are fully activated, they will show, in the box found to the left of the cards,\u00a0in full color\u00a0just as the other features are displayed. The roll over buttons are found low on the playfield, a yellow one, which is left of the #19 Hole, and a red one, which is to the right of the #22 Hole.\u00a0 The corresponding feature can only be fully activated, if the button\u00a0is \"lit up\" (brightly colored/saturated). While they are inactive and non interactable they show as \"unlit\" (dim/unsaturated)\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The features which occur randomly are described in the table below:</p><strong>Feature</strong><strong>Effect when fully activated</strong><strong>Corners (Yellow/Orange)</strong>Allows the numbers that make up the 4 corners of a card to count as a winning hit, which pays out the amount that card is set to pay out for 5-in-a-line!<strong>Superline (Green)</strong>Upgrades any scoring line found on the superline (superline location is\u00a0always the 4th row of a card, this is\u00a0shown in green if fully activated).\u00a0 Specifically this means, if you get 3 in a line on the superline, it will pay out the amount that card is set to pay for 4 in a line, as well as if you get 4 in a line on the superline, you will receive the 5 in a line payout.\u00a0 (5 in a line on the superline will not be upgraded, and will payout the amount for 5 in a line as normal)<strong>Pinball Gameplay:</strong><p>After you have acknowledged your current game \"set\", by clicking the button labeled, continue game, you will be shown the pinball playfield.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This part is a work in progress, as of right now, you can shoot the ball ball tapping the screen.\u00a0 If you make the ball in the bottom center hole, also known as home, your ball will be returned to the shooting area to be replayed.\u00a0 \u00a0After each ball you will be shown the cards, with any numbers you landed in, shown as hit numbers.\u00a0 At the end of the game you will be shown out the payouts received for each card,\u00a0 \u00a0and you can restart the game or exit.</p><strong>Card Payouts:</strong><p>The cards are displayed in the order shown in the table below, and the payout for that card is also described below:</p><strong>Card 1</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 20 ] ; [ 100 ]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Card 2</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 20 ] ; [ 100 ]<strong>Card 3</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 20 ] ; [ 120 ]\u00a0<strong>Card 4\u00a0</strong> \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 24 ] ; [ 140 ]<strong>Card 5</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 36 ] ; [ 240 ]<strong>Card 6</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0[ 4 ] ; [ 44 ] ; [ 300 ]\r\n<p>The first number shown is the payout for 3 in a line, the next is 4 in a line and finally 5 in a line.\u00a0</p><p>That should be all the information you need in order to play, thanks for your time and goodluck!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This game was originally inspired by the Bally pinball machine: Dixieland.</p>\n<p>- SwK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/6580de2f80d7735025c1bed98e99f55c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwK"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
