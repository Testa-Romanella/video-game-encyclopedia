The theme was '2025', so I made a game set on Mars in the near future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When humans tried to colonize Mars, they realized they were late, so they sent you to... convince the aliens to leave.</p>\n<p>The map is procedurally generated, so no two playthroughs will be the same. The game has weapon pickups, boss battles and more. Feedback is welcome but I won't develop the game any further.\u00a0</p><p>The Credits button is broken, so I'll just leave them here:</p><ul><li>Programming, Art &amp; SFX - Daniel Abeleira, a.k.a.\u00a0Delthor Games, a.k.a. me</li><li>Music - Minor Seven</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/8594ce6dcb4164d87c13b847741736db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Delthor Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
