With limitless power and possibilities, what would you do? How far would you go? These are the questions explored in \"Yes, Master\"; the story of one man's transformation from standard NPC to video game hero, or something else entirely.<br/> \"Yes, Master\" explores the ideas of control and unspoken desires of gamers everywhere. Video games are about controlling an avatar, a car, pieces of a puzzle, etc. Players do this to have fun and experience things that simply don't occur in everyday life, be it flying with a jetpack or engaging in a rage-fueled firefight through city streets. But maybe there a cost to violence for the sake of fun, even when simulated within the confines of a video game world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d5a4ae8d9a2bb43dea5e50cbae217f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Le\u00f4nidas S.
