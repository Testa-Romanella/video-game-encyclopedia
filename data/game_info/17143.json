Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit the caves, protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy explorers.<br/><br/>There are three unique episodes to the Crystal Caves saga: \"The Trouble with Twibbles\", \"Slugging it Out\", and \"Mylo Verses the Supernova\". Each episode has a unique story twist and graphics. Can you help Mylo strike it rich and quit his day job?Features<br/><strong>Alien Acrobat</strong>: Mylo can walk up-side-down - some levels have such low gravity that the recoil from Mylo's laser pistol can knock him into other dangers! <br/><br/><strong>Brave New World</strong>: Lightless levels, falling hammers, egg-dropping alien bats, free-roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien spiders, and much, much more!<br/><br/><strong>Controller Support</strong>: Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T07:06:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/136a0cb25d00eee183c79c0fc20727b3_rVGY8mz.jpg", "website": "https://3drealms.com/catalog/crystal-caves_7/", "rating": 2.25, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 325, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["3D Realms", "Apogee Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Apogee Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
