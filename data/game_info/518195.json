This is my first official game made using Pico-8. It was a lot of fun and I had a great time making a well-polished and enjoyable time waster. I know the controls are a little tricky, but I had to work with what Pico-8 gave me haha. Let me know what your thoughts are, and see if you can beat my current high-score of 417!</p>\n\n<p>Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T06:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de9209211c13916c5d816d1c91cb3e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["austin_io"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
