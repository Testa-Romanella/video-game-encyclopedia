The first levels are straightforward, while the last levels can be challenging (but hopefully not frustrating).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy goal was to create a game which is as simple as possible, while still satisfying and pleasing to look at.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-22T13:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b17947f3abcddea75932afe31139be8_czQh3hV.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["peterhijma", "Peter Hijma"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Peter Hijma"], "esrb_rating": null}
