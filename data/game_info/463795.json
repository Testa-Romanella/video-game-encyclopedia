IT WASN'T.</p>\n\n<p>How the Game works:</p>\n<p>You get money every 10 Seconds you can increase the amount of the Money you get through Upgrades and by capturing \"Towers\". The goal is to gather as much money as possible, after 5 Minutes the game ends and the player with the most money wins. You can upgrade your base/personal Stats\u00a0by pressing \"e\" near you base or the stats of your towers (also press \"e\" close to a tower that you've captured). You can kill enemys or their core, killing the player will respawn him in his base(no other penaltys for dying have been implemented yet). Destoying their core will stop their moneygeneration (Towers excluded) until the core is restored. Restoring cores and capturing towers works the same, just stand in them and if the circle arround them starts to change color you're capturing it.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah by the bay the ugly number on the bottom left are the health and ammo.</p>\n\n<p>Some Infos about the Upgrades:</p>\n<p>There are two upgrades that do not do anything yet:<br/>The Guard upgrade in the Base nad the notify upgrade in the tower DON'T BUY THEM YOUR JUST GONNA WASTE YOUR MONEY</p>\n<p>What the other Upgrades do:</p>\n<p>Base:</p>\n<p>Money + : increases the Money you get per intervall<br/>Money -: decreases the intervall time between recieveing Money(includes Towers)<br/>Health +: Increase you maximum Health<br/>Weapons: if you dont already own the weapon you will get it if you already own it, it will do more damage(if you bought a weapon once you can always get it back for free even if the price sais something else)</p>\n<p>Tower:<br/>Money +: Increases the money you get form this specific tower<br/>Turret: your tower turns into a turret and shoots enemies\u00a0<br/>Time up: it takes longer for enemies to steal your base</p>\n<p>(all of these upgrade get lost one you'r base is gets captures by an enemy)</p>\n\n<p>Controlls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D/Arrows : move</p>\n<p>LMB : shoot</p>\n<p>E: open the shop</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known bugs and stuff missing:</p>\n<p>-THE AI IS BAD AND DOESNT KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING<br/>-the shotgun shoots weird when shooting to the topright and bottomleft<br/>-There is no sound at all just yet<br/>-not a single texture was made for this game so far(thats hopefully gonna change soon)<br/>-Startscreen/Pausscreen<br/>-not playable on Mac yet i completely destroyed the AI after building for Windows\u00a0so i have to fix that before i can make a build for Mac</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f6139ab501dce75ecf5d792469f0f622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cowgummiboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
