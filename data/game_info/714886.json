The battle system was inspired by MMBN. It's basically a really simplified version of it! I was unable to finish the game in time for the jam, however.\u00a0 Hope you enjoy it regardless! Will update with credits, ending and other improvements in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8e439b6b8c8dc0ed220dd8d500a9660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["razenrock"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
