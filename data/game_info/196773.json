I have experience with game development using Unreal Engine 4, which I use for 3D games and Construct 2 for 2D games. However, up to this point I have only released levels for Half-Life 2 level design competitions, so I'm glad to say that this challenge has allowed me to release something complete!'ish; I proudly present</p>\n<p><em>Rhythm-based Twin Stick Zombie Survival Shooter!</em></p>\n<p>LD41's <em>Combine 2 Incompatible Genres</em> is actually the theme that I really wanted to be picked initially, with the thought that there would be thousands of interesting concepts one could come up with and create!... But I also found myself having no clue what I wanted my game to be, as you do. Thankfully, I dug up a ridiculous concept from the back of my subconscious - a rhythm-based twin stick game! And what better twin stick game to create than one about fighting zombies?</p>\n<p>In the end, the game didn't turn out quite as polished or... complete as I wanted, but I'm still very proud of it and very happy that I got to work on a Ludum Dare submission. Let's hope that next time, I can do even better. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc1355ecdb99f33aef7971b69d99d2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Niker107"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
