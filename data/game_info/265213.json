Colour the entire playing field until there is no white tile left. At the end each number has to be within a block, which is made of the exact tiles he states. If coloured blocks overlap, the marking will be removed.<br/> <br/>Hint: <br/>Click and hold a tile, then lengthen or widen it, until the block has the correct quantity. After releasing the tiles will darken and mark the block. Sometimes it doesn't look like it, but all games are solvable.<br/><br/>The team at FeliGames wishes a lot of fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c9/6c943bc4ca68257572c92ed4db46db91_D6Z8qaB.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Dusin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael Dusin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
