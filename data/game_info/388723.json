There's some kind of unholy commotion going on in the graveyard and it's putting you way behind on your beauty sleep. I guess that's why the property was so cheap, huh?</p>\n<p>Tonight, you've had enough. You grab your trusty pistol and set out to return peace and quiet to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING</strong></p>\n<p>This title is a pre-pre-pre alpha. It will contain many bugs. Dungeons are still pretty repetitive while I work on game features - content is a bit slower right now.</p>\n<p>It has ONLY been tested on Windows at 1920x1080, on the\u00a0Ultra preset. Results may be pretty wacky on other settings.</p>\n<p>Aside from checking controls in Options, there's no real tutorial here, so here's a few nuggets to help you along-</p>\n<ul><li>You have one sidearm slot and two primary weapon slots. The Broomhandle, Makarov, and Sawed Off Jr. are sidearms -\u00a0\u00a0the rest of the weapons are primaries. You can only hold one sidearm so you'll always swap out if you pick up a new one, but with primaries, they'll go into an empty slot if available, or whichever slot you have equipped if not available.\u00a0</li><li>You can mantle onto a ledge that's above you by hitting jump again in mid-air while looking at the ledge. Handy for climbing around on stuff you can't quite reach!</li><li>You can press Interact (E)\u00a0to climb on ladders</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T03:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c3e33283135c4c107b26ded19df8510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasozz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
