Make it yours.<br/>&amp;quot;Wave Trip is a magnificent creation that inspires and delights&amp;quot; - Kotaku!<br/>Wave Trip is a musical arcade game. You control a mysterious and wonderful geometric astronaut as she travels through worlds of unimaginable beauty and danger, saving her friends through the medium of awesome tunes. <br/><br/>All of the levels can be remixed and edited, and players can create their own levels and share them with the world. Since every object in Wave Trip has musical characteristics, creating a level is just like writing a piece of music - just easier (and with more cubist sheep).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38dfbb3723c97bcd52b8a242b08ec2b2.jpeg", "website": "http://www.luckyframe.co.uk/wavetrip", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lucky Frame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Lucky Frame"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
