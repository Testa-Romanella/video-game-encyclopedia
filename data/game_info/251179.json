The game is a lane runner that involves the player dodging on-coming traffic as it slowly gets faster and faster. The unique twist is the player is guiding the owner, who moves with a slight delay, as well as the dog and must not allow either to collide with on-coming traffic.</p>\n<p>Ross Fifield\u00a0:- Designer/Project manager</p>\n<p>Jack Hill :- Designer/Asset sourcing/Object pooler</p>\n<p>Nikola Krajnovic :- UI implementation</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc Mourey :- UI art assets</p>\n<p>Edward Smith :- Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/713a88f599919044196f8c8fa8d9e152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ed", "OrganicJuiceMan", "StickNik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
