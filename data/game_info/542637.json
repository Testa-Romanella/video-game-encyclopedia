It will definitely appeal to children and adults who have always dreamed of taming a dragon. Your task is to keep an eye on the huge egg: you need to make fire, throw wood into the fire and drive away the tirex and pterodactyl that extinguish it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If everything was done right, then soon you will become the owner of your own dragon. It is the dragon who will rush you over magical landscapes and let you touch the clouds. It is so beautiful that it astounds you!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T02:35:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/642e26891d7762f8d448e0310b4799e0.jpg", "website": "https://anvio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anvio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anvio"], "esrb_rating": null}
