Once you place it in your ship, you can't move the cargo until it reaches its destination.</p>\n<p>Make it to $1,000,000 credits to win. Run out of hull or fuel, and it's game over!</p>\n<p>(Note: There's currently no way to refuel, so that's a problem lol)<br/></p>\n<p>I will most likely continue working on this in the future because I had a blast!<br/></p>\n<p>Still definitely needs some polish, but I ran out of time :D</p>\n<p>*Note: There's no sound, because I was working on this solo and ran out of time.

Should trigger as soon as \"event pop up\" is closed if fail state (or win)\u00a0 conditions are met</p>\n<p>Cargo can no longer be moved before placing it into the ship</p>\n<p>Already placed cargo should no longer be visible when on cargo selection screen</p>\n<p>script for string_thousands not handling decimals or negative numbers correctly</p>\n<p>Fuel/hull should no longer go negative (well, it shouldn't STAY negative) xD<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1cfa9306919b4a8af517fd0907d724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RubixNoob13"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
