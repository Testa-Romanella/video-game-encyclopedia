You may play alone or ask a friend to control a second fighter on the same keyboard.</p>\n<p>There are two major differences to the original game. There are several different levels. If you manage to beat the all, the first level will load again, but with more difficult enemies! Also, enemies have a certain chance to drop goodies (or power-ups) that will improve your fighter for a few seconds. But beware of the dangerous fake goody that will kill you!</p>\n<p>The game needs a keyboard, so it will not work on touch-only devices!</p>\n<p>The background was generated using the Space Background Generator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:08:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a6d76d85d0cf6203a25d866578c4a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frunit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
