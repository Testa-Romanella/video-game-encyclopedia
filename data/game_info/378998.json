The app is FREE and does not ask for any permissions, no registration, and no advertising.  No internet connection is needed to play. This app was tested on a variety of Android devices with no issue including smartphone, 7-inch tablet, 10-inch tablet, and an Android TV. It will probably work on an Android smart-board although it hasn't been tested.
