The ludum dare link has some additional information for the debug tools.</p><p>Flip Out! is a platformer, with a similar mechanic to the game Ibb and Obb where gravity doesn't always behave how it should. I created it in a limited time frame, but overall I'm happy with the result. I wish I could have made levels, but I ran out of time.</p><p>Use the arrow keys to move, and ~ to enter debug mode. There are instructions on the previously mentioned ludum dare page for level editing and saving. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd352027e80072aed57f61c9ecd0ae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DeltaF1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
