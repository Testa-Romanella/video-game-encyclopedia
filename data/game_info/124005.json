{"id": 124005, "slug": "star-pilot", "name": "Star Pilot (itch)", "name_original": "Star Pilot (itch)", "description": "<p>   Star Pilot is a top-down star fighter game.  Collect power ups to upgrade your ship.  There are currently 4 different levels each with a different objective.</p><p>   In Ambush, you and a pair of allies must fight against the odds to fight your way out of an ambush.  In Assault, you race to destroy the target then escape out the bottom of the level.  In Team Combat you work with allies to wipe out the enemy's fleet.  Finally in Duel, you must destroy a prototype starfighter before it destroys you.</p><p>   This is the first game that I have completed.  I will add more content and bug fixes, so check back for more starfighter action.  If you find any problems with this game or have any questions or comments, please email me at StarPilotDevelopment@gmail.com.</p><strong>Default Controls</strong><p>\n<strong>Movement:</strong> WASD</p><p>\n<strong>Shoot:</strong> Space</p><p>\n<strong>Change Weapons:</strong> Q and E</p><p>\n<strong>Pause:</strong> Escape</p><p>\r\n\tYou can use the Options menu to change the controls.</p><p>\r\n\tRequires Java 7 to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e3e01f9b4e8ad96103bccbb17b7adb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3d6"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
