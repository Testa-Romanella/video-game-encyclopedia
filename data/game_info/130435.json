Just wanted to be transparent about that.</p>\n<p>On the smaller demon, you can see some white untop of his head, that is a mistake, our artist removed the white but it still remained for some reason.</p>\n<p>-If You Don't Want To\u00a0Become Def READ THIS-</p>\n<p>You should probably lower your headphones volume, just to be sure you don't become def xD.</p>\n<p>Even if you change the volume on the main menu, it won't change in game volume, a mistake on our part.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions just comment bellow!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy our game, and feel free to ask any questions you have :D</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Game Engine : Unity</p>\n<p>Christos Kalanidis - Programmer</p>\n<p>Sam St\u00e5lhandske - Programmer</p>\n<p>Malcolm Hammarstedt - 2D Artist</p>\n<p>Sofia Alice Svensson - 2D Artist</p>\n<p>Axel Stenberg - Level designer, Music Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02b16d0346d35626efe3faf01ed1ce9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christos Kalanidis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
