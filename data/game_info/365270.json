Harumi had lost her parents at the age of 7, so she had to leave her life to live on a farm where she was not used to going. Harumi was gradually understanding the cultivation techniques practiced by her grandmother Haru, but always thought of leaving the field to return to her routine. Harumi realized that her grandmother kept all affection and love for what she was doing, even though it was a hard work. A few months passed, and Harumi's grandmother had health complications, which led to her death. Seeking answers for the weakening of the city's economy, Haru realized that after her grandmother's death, her activity had a major impact on Sayuri. Harumi found among her late grandmother's belongings a book she had never seen, which contained all that was exercised by her grandmother. In addition, the book also describes the background of your ancestors and the reasons for the links between your family and the people who live there. However, most of the pages of the book were not there, so Harumi decided to find them and continue cultivation in order to find answers about her grandmother's mysterious bond with the city of Sayuri.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef17430f5acfffd042741c5def65277a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedro Paulo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
