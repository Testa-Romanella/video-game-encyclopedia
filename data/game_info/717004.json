Coming back to life every time he dies to keep the sadistic trees entertained. However, every time he dies he keeps some of the experience he gained while fighting. Your job is to guide him out of this terrible FATE.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions: Your health, experience points(XP), and stored XP are on the top right. Left click as fast as you can while moving to fight off the trees. Use your mouse to control where the hero faces.\u00a0 A &amp; D are for strafing and\u00a0 W &amp; S are for moving forward and back in the direction you are facing.\u00a0 The arrow keys work as well. Right-click to convert some XP into health(no limit). Press shift to use some xp to increase your stats(speed, defense, damage). Every time you die half of the XP you gained killing trees goes into your stored xp. Press the space bar to add this xp to your current xp enabling you to gain more health or increase your stats further. You can walk on the red path but not on the grass. Move to hide behind various things on the grass like bushes. Click to hide instructions and good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T08:51:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Defenestrat0r"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
