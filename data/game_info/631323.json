So I did, I threw together a few sprites and coded a simple game. I could have stopped there, but for some reason I didn't. I continued to make characters and took suggestions from friends. I improved the UI, made a character select screen, and now here we are at the final product. This game is too weird to exist and I apologize to anyone who decided to play it.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Player one:</p>\n<p>A - Scroll left through character select</p>\n<p>S - Select character, attack in battle</p>\n<p>D - Scroll right through character select</p>\n\n<p>Player Two:</p>\n<p>H - Scroll left through character select\r\n</p>\n<p>J - Select character, attack in battle\r\n</p>\n<p>K - Scroll right through character select\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Wait for the screen to say buff, when it does, hit your respective key. That's it.</p>\n\r\nMusic Credits:\r\n<p>Character Select: Nine Lives - Unicorn Heads</p>\n<p>Battle: Forget Me Not - Patrick Patrikios</p>\n<p>(Songs obtained through the YouTube audio library)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05f/05f7a8df9d3541e3856ea8e75441b4b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matthew \"Smooth\" Stanton"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
