You encounter various obstacles, like branches, tree stumps, rocks, boulders, streams, rivers, cars, etc. that you have to climb over, crawl under, or jump over. On top of that, you're being chased by wolves, and worse! On this Halloween there are worse fates than being eaten alive, it seems.</p>\n<p>You survive these various obstacles by <em>typing</em>. Words appear above the obstacles that you must type in order to surpass. Small obstacles have easy words. Large obstacles have hard words. There will be a few other special words as well, like \"flashlight\"\u00a0to turn on your flashlight/torch, or \"battery\" when said flashlight suddenly starts flickering, because why wouldn't it.</p>\n<p>I've started many, but never <strong>completed</strong> a game before. I\u00a0hope this is the first. I'm using Godot Engine 2.1.4.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<strong>What</strong><strong>Who</strong><strong>Where</strong>Backgroundedermunizzfree downloadGirl, Crow, Stream/Stump/Branch obstaclesrevangalecommissionFonts (Akt, Pleurisy, Sakred)Eeve Somepxfree download8-bit sound effectsartur_rezendefree downloadSkeletonReemaxfree downloadHaunted Housechasersgamingfree downloadFemurbartfree downloadBackground musicgoombajmrpaid downloadWolf howlFreeSoundEffects.comfree downloadEverything elsemehere", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d674308c4d66b02ff53547fabd957cb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Max"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
