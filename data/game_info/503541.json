{"id": 503541, "slug": "quantum-street-fighter", "name": "Quantum Street Fighter", "name_original": "Quantum Street Fighter", "description": "<p>Dear Player,<br/><br/>You are a ninja qubit balancing on precarious space-silicon which is stuck in a loop in the quantum-universe. As magnetic fields dangerously fly around you, you will have to fight for your coherence against another ninja-qubit. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to defeat the other ninja-qubit using quantum gates. You can flip them over with a X-gate punch, phase-flip them using a Z-gate phaser-gun or you can confuse them into a superposition by sending them a Hadamard-gate. As soon as the entities of the LOOP will offer you a gate, it is your task to collect it, and fire it onto the other ninja-qubit.<br/><br/>Player 1: Move left using the left arrow (&lt;), right using the right arrow (&gt;) and jump using the up arrow (^). Shoot the collected gate onto the other ninja-qubit using the down arrow (v).<br/>Player 2: Move left using the Z key, right using the X key and jump using the S key. Shoot the collected gate onto the other ninja-qubit using the A key. Gravity from a nearby star will pull you downwards.<br/><br/>We thank you for your dedicated work towards saving the fragile coherence of the LOOP\u2019s quantum bits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2da/2da4dc8c15f2f7a215cec067d4c3177b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yoghurtyam"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
