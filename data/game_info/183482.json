It's a Museum Exhibit!

I'm not working on it as much nowadays, but the original intention behind this kind of app was to have different kinds of Museums and historical information available to anyone with a smart phone, and a penchant for enjoying Virtual Reality.</p><p>As it is now there's only an apk for Android.
