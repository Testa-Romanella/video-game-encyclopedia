Dirt can be shot and destroyed, but some objects need to be yeeted into space. Once all objects are gone, the timer stops and you win.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use A + D to move Left/Right</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hold Spacebar to activate the jetpack</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim the cursor and hold the left mouse button to shoot.</strong></p>\n<p>Took 6 hours to make as I got stuck on some programming early on. Didn't have time to improve player animations or add in a second weapon, but I think it went okay for my first jam attempt. The prototype was ready in 2.25 hours but I didn't want to upload without art and sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40d90981596533de1e6b3148f339a502.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tkellaway"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
