The very same Gomamon from Digimon Adventure.</p>\n<p>This is a simple enough game. You press buttons to advance the game, talk and molest Gomamon. It is heavily inspired by My Very Own Lith and I recommend you check it out in case it is unknown to you.</p>\n<p>This is an unfinished game and will still need many resources to be completed.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>The world you find yourself in is not the digital world you know however, but a strange In-Between-World and you have to find your way out with Gomamon by your side. Talk, Molest and Fuck the little digimon however you please as you advance further to escape with him by your side.</p>\n<p>You can either be nice or mean to him, depending if you want him to be your Lover Slut or Slave Slut.
