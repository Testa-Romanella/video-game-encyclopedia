Once the fourth beacon is placed they will form an enclosure and teleport any crates within their bounds.<br/><br/>\u00a0The force fields of the beacons\u00a0can also be used as a walls that stop the movement of the crates.\u00a0 Press C to clear any pylons you have placed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/7091319486231589a31f045576277e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OwenBrush"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
