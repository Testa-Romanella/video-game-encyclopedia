Normally I don't participate in game jams, but because it's for a good cause\u00a0<em>(and the generous 30-day time window)\u00a0</em>I decided to participate.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong><strong>bout the Game:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Basically, you're having a nice vacation until you see the poor condition of the lake. So you decide to clean the lake yourself. To do this you have a nice little orange submarine, but the twist is:\u00a0you have to use a rope with a hook, attached to your submarine to collect trash.\u00a0<em>(sorry, that was the best idea I\u00a0had)</em>\n</p>\n<p>In this game you explore the lake, collect trash, collect upgrades that unlock more stuff to explore. And that's it. The game is very short. (15 - 45 minutes max). But I hope you all still enjoy the game.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong></p><p>With the new \"SubInTheSeaFixed\" version, a few minor issues have been fixed:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Power up counter now counts correctly\r\n</li><li>The drumroll sound at the end is no longer being started over again every frame\r\n</li><li>Added percent symbol to the completion percent number\r\n</li><li>Repositioned and removed a few checkpoints\r\n</li><li>Added the option to end the game if you have everything collected\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/8501f202bbb057156de547ec3f852e00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zappic3"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
