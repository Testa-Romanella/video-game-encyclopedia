This time, instead of being hunted, he has the equipment to deal with the ghosts. Your objective\u00a0is to\u00a0place inflatable wall blocks such that they will restrict their room space up to the point when they can't take it and go away from this world. Your tools are:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Inflatable walls - to block paths</li><li>Spike bombs - if you no longer need the inflatable wall, you can pop them by placing these bombs in parallel to the wall. Be careful - these can kill you too, if you stand too close! Note that the ghosts are immune from these - they are ghosts, that's science!</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse - navigate the menu</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - movement</p>\n<p>Hold SPACE BAR - throw inflatable wall</p>\n<p>Press X - place bomb</p>\n<p>Collect objects to refill your inventory!</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n\n<p>Note: you may notice that Pac's appearance has changed slightly over the years, and also he's now deaf (in this universe).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a27e50acd68b028313135b96491f10f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ssharkk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
