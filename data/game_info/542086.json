This game is very basic but I hope it shows off the idea I had. This project is designed to show off the mechanics and only these, since I'm a gameplay programmer. So don't go to hard on the level and UI design :) Also it doesn't have sound as I didn't get round to adding it.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Twitter: @_Scuttman_</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a7d94088cc7865d39773bec88b1318d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scuttman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
