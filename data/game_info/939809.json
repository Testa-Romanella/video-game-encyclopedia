Custom-tailored for virtual reality, this game aims to deliver a unique, immersive experience. <br/><br/>No setup required, no difficulty levels, no loading times - just click play and dive straight into the action. Whether you are an experienced archer or a new player, the game will automatically adjust to your skill level, aiming to provide the best experience for everyone. Easy to learn, hard to master!<br/><br/>Each run gets progressively harder and unlocks more and more features with every level that you pass. Every run is also uniquely different, meaning that you never know what to expect!<h3>World</h3><br/>The world of the crystal riders is big and diverse. One moment you're in a peaceful forest and the next you find yourself in a dreamy magical place that twists perception. Then you're back in the forest and soon enough - in the middle of a scorching desert. There are many environments and with each game, you only get to play some of them. You'll be able to spend hours playing before you've seen them all (if ever).<h3>Crystals</h3><br/>Crystals are everywhere! They come in a variety of shapes and elements. More action means more crystals and more crystals means even more action! Destroy crystals to unlock all kinds of spells and powers. Proper usage of these powers will get you far in this magical world.<h3>Elements</h3><br/>Every crystal gives you the power of its element. You can utilize these powers to shoot all kinds of magic arrows. Each of them has its unique utility and advantages.<h3>Powerful Spells</h3><br/>Keep up a good combat streak and suddenly your bow is imbued with arcane power that amplifies every elemental spell. Take down entire hordes of enemies with a single loose of your bow!<h3>More Crystals</h3><br/>Look out for mysterious shapes and elements. The powers that these special crystals release might greatly improve your odds.<h3>Hand Combat</h3><br/>Need to take a break from your bow? You can unleash lethal forces directly from your gauntlet.<h3>Menacing Creatures</h3><br/>In the mayhem, you might find yourself crossing strange lands. Keep yourself vigilant because the local creatures might not always be very welcoming.<h3>Endgame</h3><br/>Your battles will gradually become more chaotic and take you through stranger terrain. Are you ready for the ultimate challenge? Can you reach the endgame?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T03:50:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/894/89473560ce2d27d41b6f0cc7d11672a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikola Grunchevski"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nikola Grunchevski"], "esrb_rating": null}
