{"id": 1984, "slug": "unepic", "name": "Unepic", "name_original": "Unepic", "description": "<p>Unepic is a 2D platformer game with role-playing elements. The story follows Daniel, a sci-fi, and video games geek that one day was teleported into a fantasy world and found himself in a giant castle. The game\u2019s dialogues, storyline, and aesthetics heavily relies on humor with a lot of geek-culture references and mocking on sci-fi and fantasy clich\u00e9s.  <br />\nThe gameplay can be described as a mix of 2D Metroidvania and role-playing game. The RPG elements in the game include acquiring levels, skills-points, and equipment. There are many types of armor and weapons in the that require the absolute level and skills to be used. The fighting mechanics are pretty simple and don\u2019t have a lot of moves and abilities. Unlike many other metroidvanias, in Unepic you open new parts of the game world not by acquiring new abilities that let you go to the places you couldn\u2019t reach before, but rather by collecting keys that unlock doors in different parts of the castle.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2011-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T14:12:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b49f17ce8a4ec0ca0663103be8634421.jpg", "website": "http://www.unepicgame.com", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 79, "owned": 1660, "beaten": 104, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 101, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 286, "ratings_count": 244, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 250, "platforms": ["Wii U", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EnjoyUp Games", "@unepic_fran", "A Crowd of Monsters", "Francisco T\u00e9llez de Meneses"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["EnjoyUp Games", "@unepic_fran", "Francisco T\u00e9llez de Meneses", "Francis Cota"], "esrb_rating": null}
