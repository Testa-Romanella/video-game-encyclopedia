You will need to first suck up a ghost in order to be able to fire it at the others. Survive as long as possible and try to get the high score.</p>\n<p>For you to be able to kill the enemies you need to get close to them in order to gain new ammo. One button is used for both sucking up the ghosts and for firing the bullets.
