There are 4 possible endings to get, try to get them all!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>You're offered another job to catch up on your debt, but do you really want to go back to a life of crime?</p>\n<p>RATED (By me): T for Violence</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/></p>\n<p>Click to move through dialog and to choose choices</p>\n<p><strong>Making the game</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the TPS Game jam, so I didn't have a lot of time to make it. I originally wanted to do a longer game but time constraints forced me to size it down. For the jam, I was given a week, but due to life stuff, I was only able to work on it for 3 evenings. If there is significant interest, I could work on a longer and more polished version.</p>\n<p><strong>Things that were cut</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gunfight with Tiger</li><li>Original Music</li><li>Drivable getaway car</li><li>Playable gunfight at the end</li><li>City traffic and pedestrians</li><li>Lot's more xD</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you for reading!
