{"id": 817897, "slug": "bloodloss-blaster", "name": "Bloodloss Blaster", "name_original": "Bloodloss Blaster", "description": "<p>Welcome to Bloodloss Blaster, a game where your health is your ammo. Stuck in a dungeon, doomed to fight off a never-ending hoard of zombies, you bear the titular Bloodloss Blaster - a powerful weapon that consumes it's user's blood in exchange for firing devastating cannon balls.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move , space to jump (tap again to double jump)\u00a0and mouse to look. Press and hold the left mouse button to charge the Blaster, and release to fire!</p>\n<p>After firing the cannonball, you can \"suck it up\" by holding left mouse button again! If the ball fully returns to you, you'll regain half the health you lost.\u00a0This won't expend any additional health, and you can still damage enemies, so use it often :)</p>\n<p>If your projectile gets stuck, or you just want to fire again right away, press the right mouse button to recall the ball! This will NOT regenerate any HP like \"sucking up\" the ball does, so use this sparingly.</p>\n<p>No matter what you do, no matter how much blood you sacrifice, ultimately, with no way to regain all your lost health, you may just be doomed to die in these dungeon walls... So take as many zombies with you as you can &gt;:)</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I updated the game to fix an issue where enemies would stop spawning after a period of time. The original version of the game is available to download below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T16:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d960724f547fe4afa716aa8c6cf4963a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pefeper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
