It's like a fever dream where the only way to wake up and escape is to fight strange monsters that aren't really there. It features bite sized levels, precision jumping, combat, and some light puzzle elements. It was created with speedrunning in mind, and as such, the game can be beaten in one session (around 45 minutes of gameplay for me).<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Mark Gavin.</p>\n<p>Follow me on twitter or visit my website for information regarding future projects.
