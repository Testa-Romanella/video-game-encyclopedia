If only I had never entered that </em></strong><em><strong>Forest.\"\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>People already have a habit of going missing in the night near that Forest, but this case is a bit... <em>different</em> than the others. 21 women missing. The only evidence washed away in the rain. The village is divided between a select few that desperately want your help and a majority that will make sure you stay out of their affairs, even if you have to be the next one to disappear. Was it kidnapping, murder, or something much more dreadful?\u00a0Who can you trust? Why was the railway project really abandoned? And what are those strange noises coming from the subway grates? This game will ask many more questions than it will answer-<em>but that never stopped you before, did it now?</em></p>\n<p>Features a dismal story, lots of custom art, one ending and a handful of ways to die with unique scenes!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game focuses less on puzzles and gameplay, instead having a heavy emphasis on\u00a0exploration/investigation and storytelling. It's roughly a half hour long depending on your playing speed. There are save points, but it is recommended that you play the entire game in one sitting.\u00a0This game is set in the same universe as the other two, but the order you play these games in doesn't matter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f4580d7487998f51b5a1164eff88b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michaela Thisten"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
