Are you wave or particle? <strong>It doesn't matter, just run!</strong></p> <ul><li> Exploring a new gameplay for infinite runners  Infinite runner games are the funniest at the end of the game, when the gameplay is faster and the player starts feeling out of control.  In Photon Rush we added a twist: The player will be on the dark and won't see the path unless he decides to spend light energy. Thus, the player has to balance the gameplay, deciding whether to use the light energy at the beginning, making the first moments of the game easier, or save it for latter, when the game is faster.  In this way the gameplay should be challenging for both novice and seasoned players during the whole run. </li><li> Where are we?  We are releasing a stable version in mayor desktop and mobile platforms. </li></ul><p>Visit the official website for more info</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e61cb411c32cc1c7f9810570930fc63e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Corta Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
