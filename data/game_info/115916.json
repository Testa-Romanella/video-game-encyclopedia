{"id": 115916, "slug": "muffinquest", "name": "Muffinquest", "name_original": "Muffinquest", "description": "<p>Play as <strong>Muffin</strong>, an independent little girl exploring her world: befriend beetles and salamanders, sneak into a wizard's tower, help a distraught boglin, discover the truth about fairies, face a dragon -- and more!</p><p>20,000 words, with <strong>three different final quests</strong> that depend on your earlier choices -- very replayable.  Good for grownups who like ridiculously adorable characters and for young kids who like adventure stories.  Super for grownups to play through <em>with</em> their young kids who like adventure stories.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> there are one or two points where the piece of text you get will be longer than the game panel's height.  itch.io makes devs set a height and width, and I set that to accommodate phones about as well as I could, but it also suppresses scrollbars -- so if you get more text than one screen's worth, it looks like the game just stopped.  Pressing your middle mouse button/wheel and scrolling down that way seems to work for everyone; scrolling down with a laptop touchpad works for some people; clicking to select the text and dragging down works for some people.  The story's worth the tiny inconvenience, I promise!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49fa41dbc5c7ed3b55ed461b16d00c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Otaara"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
