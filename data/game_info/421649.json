You must escape...</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>: A/D or LEFT/RIGHT to move. F to kill yourself and return to the last rested spot. O to attack and control descents (will be necessary as fall damage is brutal) You can press Esc at any time to return to the Main Menu, but please be aware that the game has no saving or persistent checkpoint system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:39:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pad-3"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
