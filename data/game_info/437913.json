Goal is to collect as many points as possible by shooting\u00a0zombies with potatoes\u00a0:) It gets quite challenging so you have to spend earned coins wisely and upgrade your potato gun. Oh yeah... and always check you don't run out of potatoes!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This little game was my experimental project which over time became a thing, so\u00a0I decided to share it with everyone.\u00a0Planning to build more levels, maybe a small campaign even, or multiplayer when I have more time... Future is\u00a0uncertain, but\u00a0in the meantime... Have Fun !!!
