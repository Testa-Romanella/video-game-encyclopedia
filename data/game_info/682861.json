And they've been making videos with it for ages, so you'll have to forgive them. The truth is that as long as you don't use it as a gun-wielding monster and wear a teddy bear as a boombox, you won't be shot. (As in 'we need our guns on account of their being tethered to our heads', as this video shows.) We'll give them some of this money, but keep in mind that even if they're not bluffing, the fact that you've never heard of them is probably not going to discourage them from continuing.<br/>\nThis might seem like a silly point, but to understand what's really going on we should look at what's really going on in the real world. And I'm sure that's not the context of your future thoughts. But the main point is that there are actually huge problems with gun control not being done at all in the US. And to understand why, we look at the horrific reality of people farming wild animals at the point of a gun in Australia.\n\nI'd like to start by saying, though, that I'm not anti-gun. I'm pro-gun ownership in my private capacity. I've gone to events professionally and personally with people who advocated for the right to bear arms.
