Water is replenished by standing in rivers and streams, and your size changes with the amount of water you've collected.</p>\n<p>In liquid form, Drate is able to run left and right, jump, and looses water while standing on a dry surface. The constant loss of water forces players to navigate quickly though the level while dashing in between water sources.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In solid form, Drate can move, but he \"freezes\" at different sizes depending on how much water he had. While frozen, Drate continuously melts. Although this doesn't allow water to evaporate, it does revert him back to his liquid form over time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In gaseous form,\u00a0 Drate can fly and pass through some objects. However, he also loses water much faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is unfinished, but we wanted to submit the work that we had done over the course of the jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Arrow keys to move and jump.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5cfe9173a5b25b5df9da86bd69f470.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lynwo", "futureforge", "chaendizzle", "Richitt10", "savvymann"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
