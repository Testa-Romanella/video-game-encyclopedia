Each rescued girl increases the brightness of your light, making it easier to see your surroundings. Monsters lurk in the forest which attempt to steal rescued girls from your party. Each time you play, the level is randomly generated so each playthrough is different. This game was made at a Game Jam at Ritsumeikan University in Japan, and won first place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a81/a8177d96f0a7ae3bfa1efebdd6316a6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan Glick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
