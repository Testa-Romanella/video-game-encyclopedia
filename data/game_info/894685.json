It also helps with little kids around the home that find your physical deck of cards and decide to mess up the state of the deck or lose cards altogether.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- You can create campaigns with their own unique deck that remembers the state of the deck, the history of the deck and any prompts you want to associate with a card draw.<br/>- Customize each campaign's deck to match the ruleset from the game you are going to play. Need to remove jokers? Easy. Need to remove only the face cards from your deck? No problem!<br/>- You have the option to manually or auto shuffle when the deck runs out of cards to draw.<br/>- Easily edit the information for your campaign and also edit the prompts entered for any previous card draws.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T08:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1befcb7faa7bf126ca870a1b75c79dd9_YPB1lh6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nerd Room Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Card"], "publishers": ["Nerd Room Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
