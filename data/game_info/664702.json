Created for Unity development course at GameDev.tv.</p>\n<p>-Movement is WASD<br/>-Mouse to look<br/>-Hold Left-Shift to run<br/>-Space to jump<br/>-Left mouse fires staff<br/>-Right mouse zooms in, increases distance slightly<br/>-Head shots are one-shot-kills<br/>-Grab white orbs to increase light capacity<br/>-Grab purple orbs to increase ammo of equipped staff<br/>-Ammo indicated by colored bars in UI<br/>-Scroll mouse wheel to switch elements<br/>-Hit Q to quite the game</p>\n<p>Very brief level balanced to force the pickups. It'll get dark quick if you don't go for the lights, and you'll get killed if you don't go for the head shots. <br/><br/>There is no difference between the staves at this point, this is a very very early prototype. My goal in this project was to work out satisfying combat responses. <br/><br/>*All assets are home brewed or used on Single Entity License from Unity Asset Store<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/127aa3a0ef5a886c030d5eb85449ea16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games From The Meep"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
