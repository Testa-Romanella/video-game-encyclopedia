Each team has its own strengths and weaknesses, you'll not only have to master your abilities, but also learn how to work as a team in order to endure and emerge victorious.<br/><br/>The overall gameplay in Lightphobe blends match-based shooters and zombie shooter games in a classic point capture mode setting; where both teams must race to capture an objective point. With only one team being able to capture the objective at any given time, Lightphobe is full of chaotic fun as both teams fight to establish their dominance!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The last thing a soldier wants is to be stuck in the dark with lightphobes sitting on their tail! A soldier must protect the target from the oncoming hordes of monsters. This means knowing when it's best to reload, getting a good feel for weaknesses that enemies can exploit, and moving strategically to best protect themselves and the target.<br/><br/>Soldiers can choose from 5 weapon options for different play styles. Choose your style and stop the offensive with your partners!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Lightphobes must capture the objective by entering the capture zone, which is bound to be heavily defended by Soldiers. How they go about this is up to them to decide. They could fight head-on and overwhelm the Soldiers with an unrelenting assault, or they could instead opt for a stealth approach and use the blindspots of the Soldiers to sneak around unseen.<br/><br/>However, that's not all! Lightphobes also possess a natural invincibility in the dark, and must be exposed by a special light source before they can be killed. This additional game mechanic adds an extra layer of complexity that both teams must be aware of at all times.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Lightphobe is currently experimenting with neural networks and is expecting that there will be improvements to the AI of Lightphobe enemies in the future. The recording of datasets for the purpose of improving the AI is optional and turned off by default. Datasets are also only ever recorded and saved on a player's local computer and never shared without the recording player's permission.<br/><br/><strong>NOTE: Lightphobe can support up to 16 players in a single match, and playing with multiple players is recommended.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T07:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910b7df8b0b38e2aed46101557137bb7.jpg", "website": "https://www.lightphobe.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mutant Realm Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Mutant Realm Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
