Drawing LARGE inspiration from games such as\u00a0<em>Astroneer</em>,\u00a0<em>Minecraft, Wrought Flesh,</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Stardew Valley</em> to make this sort of large exploration, resource farming, top down shooter amalgamation. This is my first game in the genre, so it will be unbalanced.</p>\n<p>Controls in game, but for those who are to lazy to read it in\u00a0 project, and instead have taken the time to scroll all the way down and read this dumb thing HEY DON'T YOU SKIP ME YET: Mouse to rotate and shoot, W/S to move forward and backward, E for map, and Space for autopilot. Autopilot locks your rotation and moves you forward.</p>\n\n<p>Art, Code, Sounds, and Music are done by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T06:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90bcc491417a8723ad2e76560ea644e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fries09"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
