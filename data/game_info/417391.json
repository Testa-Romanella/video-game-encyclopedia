Meanwhile, radars are scanning you and sending defense baloons loaded with explosives. Nothing you can do against so you rather focus to destroy antenae first and then lower building levels to flat the city and have a soft landing. Levels increase number of defenses and strength of buildings, so you will need more efficiency. The sky is cloudy, so you will need to guess where are you while crossing the clouds layers. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:01:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/072a4bcd65187b59b7241676b8413489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["agnuca"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
