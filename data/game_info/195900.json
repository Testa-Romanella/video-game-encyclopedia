Making the middle number void. you do this by adding fire or water to the number. you will know which to add by colour. 2. You also get points for solving the equation at the top. all you have to do is click the Store Number button. this will make one of the question marks equal the middle number. Once all the question marks are filled if the 2 numbers equal the end number your score will go up by the end number. 3. You also get points for gambling. if you press the Roll Dice button the dice will decide whether you gain or lose points/time. Hope You Enjoy My Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/478d033ee6ee2f9760e947a192316dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N.O. games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
