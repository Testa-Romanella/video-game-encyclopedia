I decided to keep it relatively simple with a catapult that launches a ball which leads to a bunch of dominos being knocked over, followed by a bowling ball ending! In the future, I want to try building AI elements and building full-fledged games using Unity. I am excited to see more of the tools it offers!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T18:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/2094e72601b79b5fecac89baa37ee3eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shugo16"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
