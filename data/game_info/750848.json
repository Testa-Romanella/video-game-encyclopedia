Beat the final boss to get your very own gamer license*.<br/></p>\n<p>The browser version of the game -should- be fully playable from start to finish. Browser performance takes a hit in the later rounds, so I strongly recommend you download if you want to be a winner. Also both cardamom and flytrap had some internet problems and couldn't make it to html5 :(<br/></p>\n<p>This version (1.0) is free to download, but that won't be the case forever! 1.0 was released to gauge interest and see what people think of the game. A tip is always greatly appreciated** - and feedback is super helpful moving forward!</p>\n<p><em>*advertised gamer license not actually included anywhere in version 1.0. you were directly lied to. deceived, even.<br/>**this, however, is completely true.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T05:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/446/446f0d2cd893073e11ad1507cc718ed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["2sDan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
