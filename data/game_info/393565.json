After fighting off a wild beast, he realizes that he is an adept fighter. He walks for days with no memory of the life he left behind. Does he have a family? Are they worried about him? How does he survive this expansive desert?<br/><br/>In distant shores, an older brother goes off to find his sister. \"She's probably off playing on the cliffs again,\" he thought to himself. \"When is she going to grow up and stop being a little kid.\" As he finds her he yells, \"Koko, we have to gather flowers! It's grandmas birthday tonight, and grandma loves flowers!\"<br/><br/>\"Grandma is senile and she can't tell a flower from a fern.\"<br/><br/>\"Why are you being such a brat? Let's go!\"<br/><br/>The children had not come home and it was well past dark. Their mother set out to find them. \"Rambunctious children,\" she thought. Suddenly, she heard light steps in the distance. She had more experience than most in the art of stealth. \"Come out,\" She demanded. \"Your steps are like falling trees. Your breath like a storm. My shuriken could find your heart in the pitch black.\"<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Expansive Story</li><li>Original Music by Acclaimed Musicians</li><li>Original Pixel and Traditional Art</li><li>An Innovative Experience, Calling On Classic RPG Elements</li><li>Game+ Mode for Multiple Replays and End-game content</li><li>Episodic Format, The Story Will Continue at a Later Date After Purchasing the Base Game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e502bce16b411db74e23a618cf7ae5.jpg", "website": "https://familiarpg.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Abraham"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joseph Abraham"], "esrb_rating": null}
