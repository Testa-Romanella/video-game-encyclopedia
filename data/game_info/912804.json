Inside dreams<br/>often evoke a sense of confusion and disorientation. The dream world is a realm of<br/>the mind that is not bound by the laws of physics or reality, and as such, it can be<br/>challenging to make sense of what is happening.</p>\n<p>The characters, settings, and events\u00a0in the dream may seem illogical and disconnected, leaving the dreamer feeling\u00a0bewildered and uncertain. Additionally, the emotions and thoughts experienced in the\u00a0dream may be difficult to understand or interpret, adding to the confusion. Overall,\u00a0the feeling of inside dreams can be unsettling and perplexing, leaving the dreamer\u00a0questioning their own reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, no compulsory instructions require players to do certain things, as in<br/>dreams, people tend to feel aimless. However, the players are free to kill the cubes by\u00a0bumping into them and walking or jumping around while exploring the environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Techniques</strong></p>\n<p>The assets in the scene are made in Maya and textured with PBR material; the terrain\u00a0is built and textured in Blender. The environment and level design are created in\u00a0Unity; also, the lighting and rendering are done in Unity.</p>\n<p>The gameplay techniques are\u00a0made with C sharp in visual studio and visual scripting of Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:06:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd131bb06621bc65155a0090c55c02fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WenyunduoLi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
