But it won\u2019t be just any old story. It\u2019s going to be different, because it\u2019s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let\u2019s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other\u2019s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out \u2013 the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone \u2013 they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That\u2019s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.</p>\n<p>What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities \u2013 she can run fast, he can sneak \u2013 but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there\u2019s nothing in the world that can stop you.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>\u2022A moving story about friendship and love in dangerous times</p>\n<p>\u2022Beautiful, sketch-like graphics inspired by na\u00efve art</p>\n<p>\u2022Pair mechanics: take control of two characters with different skills and abilities, or control them as a pair</p>\n<p>\u2022A grotesque tale mixed with bittersweet humor</p>\n<p>\u2022The events shown in the game are based on actual stories from war</p>\n<p>\u2022A dialogue system built around the language of symbolic pictures</p>\n<p>\u2022Various logical puzzles in 2.5D</p>\n<p>\u2022A story that offers deeper meaning, set in historical realities</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T21:42:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d91dc907f641f1a770429a501da594e.jpg", "website": "http://mymemoryofus.com", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 300, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 67, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "iOS", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Virtual Programming", "Crunching Koalas", "IMAGINATION", "Juggler Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["IMGN.PRO", "Crunching Koalas", "Virtual Programming"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
