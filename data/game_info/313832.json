That said, Eldervale is much more than paying respects to the classics : It puts it's own twist on the genre, making it more accessible to new players as well as nostalgic for veterans. I hope you will enjoy, so I can continue putting hard work in for a genre I love.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/0721641f93c9abe96fbcd8a2add222e2.jpg", "website": "https://eldervale.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solkitte"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Solkitte"], "esrb_rating": null}
