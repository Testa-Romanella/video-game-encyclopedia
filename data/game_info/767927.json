The idea is to increase your size by eating smaller objects and also increasing your score in the match-3 game in the smaller screen, hence using the theme Big and Small for the increasing size of the circles but also having to manage and big and small screen.</p>\n<p>The goal is also to avoid the black circles because if you collide with them the game ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions: Move around with arrow keys and click on matches with mouse.</p>\n<p>This game was is unfortunately not finished since it is missing a few things due to college and work:</p>\n<p>-Enemy AI</p>\n<p>-Increasing size when score increases</p>\n<p>I will come back and complete this though even after the jam so if you like the game or think it has potential look out for a update in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c388a181c8be435e2c57eba3fdebea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ntellect Gaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
