But watch out there are other things falling as well, If you are hit with anything other than food it will add to your hunger and if it fills up completely then you lose. Finish the game by surviving all 16 levels.</p>\n<p>Left Arrow=move left\r\nRight Arrow=move right\r\nZ Key=O Button/Jump\r\nX Key=X Button/Main Menu Instructions</p>\n<p>Author's Note:</p>\n<p>This is my first decent game created with pico 8 and I am not a skillful programmer. So I apologize if you looked at my messy code. It is definitely not optimized, full of bugs and will give you headache if you read it. So be warned. I do plan to refactor this in the future but for now please bear with the game and I hope you enjoy it.
