I also woke up on time, but fell back asleep losing a <em>crucial</em> 5 hours, so that didn't help much. \r\nAt least half of my time was spent on getting the dice to roll properly, I was \u00a0definitely ready to give up pretty early on but I stuck through it. The HUD was another massive pain point, I basically didn't end up using it except for the suspicion indicator (the red screen). \r\nDespite all this setup for failure, my first foray into the realm of the 3 Dimensional has been quite successful. Luckily for me, before I fell asleep, I came up with the idea for  the game. I wanted rigged dice, turning their inherent randomness to your own benefit. Seeing as the main way to rig dice was through weights, I could practice Unity's physics AND 3D environment. What a perfect project! I am actually quite surprised at how easy the transition was. This isn't to say there weren't any challenges\u2013there most certainly were\u2013but this was an <em>amazing\u00a0</em>learning experience.\r\nHope you had fun and I've intrigued you somewhat with <em>Rig the Dice</em> I'm very excited to see everyone else's games!\r\nCredits:\r\nDice 3D Model<br/>\r\nPoker Chip 3D Model\r\nDice Logo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b169c2e2e083734b91f3bef85717709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TaLc"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
