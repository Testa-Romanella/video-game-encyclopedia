You must remember which      planets you have already visited, otherwise it will take longer.</p>\n<p>Set your expectations: this      was created for a Game Jam, so it is a prototype of a single gameplay      loop.\u00a0 I know the lighting,      textures, fog, and many other things need lots of polish. Also, this is      basically a single level Time Trial, so re-playability is limited, but it      is a tech demo of the core gameplay mechanic.</p>\n<p>Works with PC VR on Windows,      tested with Quest 2 via Air Link and Valve Index with Index Controllers.      It may work with Vive wands (using the touchpad in place of thumb sticks),      but I could not test that.\u00a0 It uses      OpenXR, so it will use the default OpenXR runtime on your system (either      Oculus or SteamVR or something else).\u00a0      All the assets are low-poly, so it should run on low-end VR-capable      PCs.\u00a0 I did not have the time to get      a native Quest 2 port working, and I did not have the time to get teleport      working (so smooth locomotion is the only option, sorry about that!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T11:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/730c88d88d129bd6379626ae07d0af47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoddledSoftware"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
