We also see this as good for our customers which in turn increases the value we provide to them.\n\nTo take the idea of 'Wanted' further we have created a website to show the game and play it in full HD on your Android device, with WP7 and higher compatible devices.\n\nWe are planning on Raidou Namikawa, the creator of 'Wanted', to be our Executive Producer, but ideally with a mix of experienced and young development talent.\n\nSo, we are eager to hear your feedback and you can ask us your questions on our website and email us at info@yoichuismedia.com.\n\nIf you are ready to download 'Wanted' and enjoy yourself you can download it from the Google Play store for free.\n\nPlease feel free to follow us on Twitter @yoichuismedia and on Facebook.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0aba17ef062aa1bd5b31c654e70cd9bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
