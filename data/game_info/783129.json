A game that took me 5 years to finish and\u00a0that I always wanted to play, but didn't exist. The game objective is simple: reach the highest scores by eating lots of donuts. For that, you should be surprised with the amount of possible builds and strategies to try out. Be creative!</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>The soundtrack was produced by Marcos Mello.
