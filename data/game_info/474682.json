This means it's time to go back to work after a long break. But wait a minute\u2026 It seems that some townspeople have gone mad during their isolation! Now, freely going out into the streets of the city, they leave the sewer hatches open for you to fall into them, throw things out of the windows so that they fall on you, run through the streets, shout if you come close to their children, and are just ready to beat you for what you\u2019re here. So now, if you want to get to work on time, you have to overcome all obstacles and survive in this crazy post-quarantine city.\u00bb\r\nCREATORS\r\n  \r\n<strong>Ksan</strong> (coder/author of idea)\r\n<strong>Tim DN</strong>\u00a0(artist/animator)\r\n<strong>Freesound.org</strong>, <strong>Internet</strong> (sound effects)\r\n  \r\n<strong>Oscar Owl </strong>(music)\r\nThe game is made for <strong>My First GameJam</strong>\r\nPOST SCRIPTUM\r\n  \r\nPerhaps, the game will be improved over time.
