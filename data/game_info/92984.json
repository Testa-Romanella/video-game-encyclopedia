The goal of the game is to create a \"cross\" of same-colored tiles to clear them from the screen, which gives you points and refills your time meter. Keep on swiping and race against the clock!<br/></p>\r\nWhat's a cross?\r\n<p>A cross is a<strong>\u00a0full row and full column of the same color</strong>. You build crosses by moving tiles horizontally or vertically. You can learn more in the tutorial!<br/></p>\r\nHow do I move tiles?\r\n<p>There are a lot of ways to play CROSSNIQ - your mouse, a controller, or even your finger if you're using a touch screen laptop/ultrabook. Simply click/tap and drag, if you're using a mouse/finger/stylus. If you're using a gamepad, make sure to check out the tutorial for controls. <br/></p>\r\nCan I lose?\r\n<p>Yeah, if you run out of time. To keep the time bar full, keep making crosses! Careful, it'll get fast and faster as your level increases.<br/></p>\r\nSweet, where can I play?\r\n<p>Right here! The game window should have loaded right above this section, if you're viewing from a desktop browser. If the game isn't loading or is having performance problems, you can also download CROSSNIQ to play offline! Windows, Mac, and Linux are currently supported. Currently CROSSNIQ does not support mobile devices, but check back soon for more information! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cd/3cd9551ec15646d4fe4dcd031ab4e833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Max Krieger"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
