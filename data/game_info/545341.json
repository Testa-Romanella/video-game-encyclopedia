But someday after an accident he lost his sight. With losing his eyes, his sole purpose became to see again. And with this he lost his peace. And after a few unlucky meetings later a woman named sakura said she can help him. And with accepting this he lost his freedom. For 5 years he became the experiment toy of sakura. In the end he never gains back his sight. But now he doesn\u2019t need it. Because now he can see electricity. He can see the back of the walls, he can see the electricity cabals and even light. And this makes him the most dangerous hitman alive. With losing his sight, peace and freedom now his sole purpose is killing everyone who works with sakura and save everyone who is being an experiment like him.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T04:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6afed365246ee1f90d9c8d7846b59d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ssumo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
