I highly recommend trying to beat the game without <strong>IDLE-MODE</strong>!<br/>After that you can let it <strong>IDLING</strong>... Its up to you!<br/><br/>Norega is a game where you play as Kurt, a Knight in training, and your task is to feed up Kurt's stats so that he can improve in Strength and be able to defeat the tougher monsters found on the outskirts of Norega.  You must click the <strong>GATES</strong> (Button) and the Gates can take you to 5 diffeent locations and is up to you to decide whats best for you at the moment as long as you defeated the previous stages.<br/><br/><h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li>Fight Enemies<br/></li><li>Alchemy<br/></li><li>Jewelry<br/></li><li>Sharpen Equipment<br/></li><li>Master Talents (HALLS)<br/></li><li>Bank<br/></li><li>Smith(Craft weapons)</li></ul><br/>Thanks! =)<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T02:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/527f7a3d6328042fee3e756cc59a475c.jpg", "website": "https://www.pixelabor.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixelabor", "Renan Miguelote Vianna"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Renan Miguelote Vianna"], "esrb_rating": null}
