You find a message there - and with it, the opportunity for one last conversation.</em></p>\n<p>I Knew You Would Find This is a short interactive fiction Twine game experimenting with the mechanic of spelling out a message using individual letters as links, as opposed to linking to new passages. I'm very excited to share it with the world, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Thank you to Grim Baccaris for Twine coding help, Riley CJ Kenway and Anna Webster for playtesting, and AK Fedeau and Xalavier Nelson Jr., for listening to me yell about this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27e/27efe0d00910a4e92a6be20a0370bb1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nessa Cannon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
