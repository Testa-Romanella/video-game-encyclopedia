This was a solo project by me. Herding regular white sheep will give you 1 point and 4 additional seconds, rarer black sheep will give you 1 point but 10 additional seconds. Super rare gold sheep will give you 5 points and 10 seconds!</p>\n<p>Sheep and Dog assets: Omabuarts Studio</p>\n<p>Nature assets: JustCreate</p>\n<p>Music: Vertex Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d7bef771a123fc2ea1a68805d25f5e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ericklatshaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
