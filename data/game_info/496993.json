The theme was \"Glide\" and I decided to create a riddle themed paperplane game, where you can place various items to get to the goal. It is my first game ever created and I hope you like it. Please give good feedback so i can better myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE!:</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to drag the camera to the position you want.</p>\n<p>AND important play this game in fullscreenmode so the inventory does not take all the space. Sorry for the inconvenience but i messed up at the build and I dont have that much time for the submission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ceadf9f1d00092f453807f540e86eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hydropic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
