You can have up to 3 spells equipped at once. There are 15 spells to make! Made in\u00a0 9 days for Jamcraft.<br/><br/><strong>TIPS<br/></strong>- Enemies have a percent chance to drop an element depending on the difficulty. The higher it is, the higher the chance to drop!<br/>- Remember, to equip spells after you press \"Craft\", go to the spellbook in the other corner of the room.\u00a0<br/>- Spells you cast can also hurt you, so be careful!</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Carbon_4444 for the 3D models, and lunaticchild for the sounds!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93bf33aa49498791554a233ba71c85a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Junglerally Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
