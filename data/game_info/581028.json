There is no one else, it's a single player game.<br/>\r\nThe ambiance in the game is calm and relaxing, with a pleasant and modern indoor architecture style.<br/>\r\nAs the name indicates you should play the levels many times to get better lower times, it's a race but in a walking simulator mode.<br/>\r\nJust find the keys and the exit.
