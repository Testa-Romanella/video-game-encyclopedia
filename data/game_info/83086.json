Other Top Gear apps include the Who is the Stig app, the Top Gear Stunt School and Where\u2019s Stig. We\u2019ve also launched the Cool Wall app for the iPad. <br/><br/>And now, it's time for the Cool Wall App... <br/><br/>We listened to your feedback, on Facebook, twitter and in the app store, and since you all wanted you own personal Cool Wall and a lot of cars to put on there, we updated the app for you. Now you can create your own Cool Walls, as well rearrange the show Cool Wall itself. <br/><br/>Using over 350 cars, you can place the cars where you think they should be on the Cool Wall and find out in an audio sound bite if the presenters think you've got it right. If your favourite car's missing, you can even add it into the mix. Just take a photo, input the name and stats and place it on your wall. All the images of the cars are complete with stats. <br/><br/>Be warned though, the car stats are highly suitable as slightly dodgy pub facts, but use sparingly when you need to win an argument. Where there was more than one model, we simply picked our favourite. For the most accurate stats, the car reviews section of www.topgear.com/uk/car-reviews is still the place to go. <br/><br/>What\u2019s new in the two latest versions: <br/>- Original 350 from first version added back in, as requested.<br/>- Personal Cool Wall added with drag and drop feature <br/>- If your favourite car's missing, there's the ability to add it in.<br/>- Ability to load the full wall from the show to place the cars where you think they should be<br/>- Quiz aspect is replaced by audio/graphic from the presenters telling you where it should be whether you agree or not! <br/>-----------------------------------<br/><br/>Some new user reviews:<br/><br/>***** Great:<br/>\u201cGreat app for any Top Gear fan\u201d<br/><br/>***** Brilliant:<br/>Great app.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Stay up to date on Top Gear news:<br/>Website: www.topgear.com<br/>Like us: www.facebook.com/topgear <br/>Follow us: www.twitter.com/BBC_TopGear <br/>Sign up for the Top Gear newsletter: http://on.fb.me/arpMAP <br/><br/>This app is produced by BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC.
