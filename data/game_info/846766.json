Follow Scarlet Games for updates!\r\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Made within 1 week for Whisker Jam 2022!</p>\n<p>Race through the city streets against up to 9 other cats. Drift through tight alleyways to claim first place! <strong>You can use either keyboard/mouse or joypad!</strong></p>\n<p>Choose from 3 breeds of cat, all with their own stats!</p>\n<p><strong>Note: As this game was created within 1 week by 1 developer, bugs and unforeseen issues are expected.</strong></p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Big crashes into lamposts and walls can force the player to fall through the floor. If this happens, just press the reset button.</li><li>AI can sometimes experience the above issue, but are unable to reset and will be missing from the race.</li><li>There is no pause menu during the race.</li><li>Joypad support in the main menu is a little buggy. Consider using a mouse for this.</li><li>The AI are sometimes a little too unforgiving on easier difficulties.</li><li>The game size is over 1GB which is a little too big for what it is. Will try to reduce this in future.</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to Whisker Games for hosting Whisker Jam 2022!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681943b8d660f58b5e4721ea03f0ad14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scarlet Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
