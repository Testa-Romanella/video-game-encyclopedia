Playing either with mouse and keyboard or with a VR headset, you can blow on your microphone to interact with your environment. Moreover, we wanted to convey a dreamlike atmosphere with strong emotions, so we opted for more stylised graphics, taking a painting-like aspect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, we start in a surreal black and white environment. A young child's figure stands in front of a fragmented house. As we approach him, he wishes to find his lost parents before blowing on a dandelion. In doing so, the child disappears in a wave of seeds which reveal to us his colourful memories. We are then invited to explore his family\u2019s afternoon, where we discover what tragedy took place.</p><p>Lukas\u00a0Sabaliauskas</p><p>Vincent Carpintero<br/></p><p>Alexis Parent</p><p>Jonathan Tcheutchemi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/76758f04a7761ae9cc209e2c5d1ba2a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vincenten3D"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
