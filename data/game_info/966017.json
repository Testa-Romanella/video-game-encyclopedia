Although officially 'for amusement only', used for gambling nevertheless. Eventually banned in many states all over the world. They proved to be too addictive, too dangerous.<br/><br/>Those who know Bingo Pinballs \u2013 maybe even had the chance to play them \u2013 will appreciate the realistic game play. Those who don't know them may be surprized: at first glance it looks just a kind of flipper pinball. But they will soon realize that to score the highest wins, hard decisions have to be made with many possible strategies to follow. No, there's no money involved in the simulations, but can prove to be very addictive still. And no, they have nothing to do with that other bingo game, often played in senior homes...<br/><br/><ul><li>Look and feel of original Bingo Pinball machines<br/></li><li>All sounds sampled from real Bally and United Bingos<br/></li><li>Large, crisp graphics<br/></li><li>Ready to use in a two screen Virtual Cabinet (PinballX and Pinup Popper compatible)<br/></li><li>Interface to connect to a real Bingo Cabinet<br/></li><li>Available for Windows and Apple OSX<br/></li><li>Bally Show Times included, free to play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T04:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d178bb52c3eec9158ff13820370bf74.jpg", "website": "https://www.bingopinball.nl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["J.M.L.
