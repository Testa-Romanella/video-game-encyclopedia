This may be the most unfair pong game ever created, with enemies using weapons such as rockets and lasers to defeat you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unlock new player characters</strong> and go from a classical pong pedal to shooting at your enemies with dual machine guns. Advance on the progression system to get more and more choices.</p>\n<p>A\u00a0<strong>random\u00a0event system</strong>\u00a0in the simulated environment prevents fights from ever being the same. The more you play the more random events you unlock.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight multiple bosses</strong>\u00a0to claim the throne of the ultimate pong master. But even then, there may still be hidden\u00a0<strong>secrets\u00a0</strong>waiting to be found...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Get your friends to help you out!</strong>\u00a0Supports local coop multiplayer with up to 4 people.
