Click and drag to move ships into the correct docks. Unload the cargo, then leave. Avoid crashing into other ships. <br/><br/><h3>Dock and undock interesting ships in interesting locations</h3>Carefully bring in an LNG carrier along the canals of Port City, while making sure the other ships are waiting for their turn to cross this tight canal. For those who love to multitask, this is Port of Paradise for you. We currently have 3 beautiful maps and are working on more.<br/><br/><h3>Doodle your routes</h3>Channel your inner creativity. Doodle around and watch your ships moving in the most cringe ways. Hey, maybe that doodle will actually result in a higher score.<br/><br/><h3>Manage close calls with clever multitasking</h3>Expertly manage your ship routes to avoid close calls. Just another regular day at the harbor (or as the Brits call it, harbour). Reduce risk of collision by planning your routes way in advance, keeping view of all ships coming in and out of the harbor.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T12:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77d9ab4d840c32fba10c8d6e47b48cf8.jpg", "website": "https://www.urbanisotope.com/game/harbor-captain/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Urban Isotope"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Urban Isotope"], "esrb_rating": null}
