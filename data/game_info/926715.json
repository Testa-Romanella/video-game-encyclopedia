Move with left stick, move camera with right stick. You can dash with LB.<br/>\r\nThe rules are simple! If you defeat all the enemies, you win. On the other hand, if your HP is reduced to zero by the enemy, you lose.<br/>\r\nPlease be careful as you cannot pass through the wall of light.<br/>\r\nThe current work is unremarkable, but based on your feedback, I will make improvements and update it as a real work on February 28th. Thank you for your cooperation.<br/>\r\nAttacks can hit even if the enemy is away because they generate shockwaves. Currently, there is only one stage, but as more stages are added in the future, it will become an \"equal game\" that can be achieved through player skill and practice, without any skill ups or item equipment.<br/>\r\nAlso, based on your opinions, we will promptly and accurately update to provide a better successful experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T04:35:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dc4a679d0bf37278cbad1e4e8f2f8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FightContinue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["FightContinue"], "esrb_rating": null}
