Taking inspiration from traditional first-person dungeon crawling games of yesteryear, Crawl breathes new life into a classic genre by introducing a verb system and action-timing combat. Throughout the game the player will traverse incredible dream worlds, fight bizarre infections, and reunite memory fragments. Crawl is a student project and is in some ways heavily flawed; however, it is an impressive demonstration of how far the Game Maker engine can be stretched.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T00:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/967/967c9cea1cdc2942c8e2ed9982e14673.jpg", "website": "https://www.indiedb.com/games/crawl1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
