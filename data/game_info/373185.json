{"id": 373185, "slug": "evol-circuit", "name": "Evol Circuit", "name_original": "Evol Circuit", "description": "<p>Evol Circuit is a cellular automaton, which is a grid system of cells that abide by a set of rules and interact with each other. Even just a handful of rules can create stunning results, the most famous example would be Conway's Game of Life. This simulation is inspired by Wireworld, a similar variant which allows for easy digital circuitry.</p>\n<p>White cells will generate Red electron \"signal\" cells. Those signals will fade over time and if they bump into another one, they both cancel out. The Black cells can be considered wires that carry the signals.</p>\n<p>The background grid is infinite. It will allow you to place cells anywhere in the grid on positive X and Y values. The game runs very fast for this kind of program. In fact, it might be the fastest cellular automaton because of a unique way of handling the grid system. But I digress.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left Click: Paint Particles</p>\n<p>Right Click: Delete Particles</p>\n<p>[\u00a0 ]: Change Brush Size</p>\n<p>Shift: Accelerate Camera Movement</p>\n<p>Scrollwheel or\u00a0- +: Zoom In/Out</p>\n<p>Number Keys: Quick Change palette</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Select items on the menu</p>\n<p>WASD: Pan the Camera</p>\n<p>Control + 0: Reset the Camera</p>\n<p>Other shortcuts are shown in the bottom left when highlighting menu options.
