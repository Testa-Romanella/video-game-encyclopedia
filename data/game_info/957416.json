In sinsational you are an angel that has fallen from heaven due to indulging in the 7 deadly sins too much. All your virtues except humility have been stolen by the sins. Now to prove yourself and become an angel once again you must take the last virtue: you have humility and defeat 3 sins and reclaim your virtues before it is too late and you remain fallen forever. You will have to fight each sin one after another in this boss rush out of hell. You may choose which sins to take on in any order you like. Each boss will be a unique puzzle or fight that you will have to shoot or think your way out of. The puzzles and fights may not involve one big bad guy but will involve the theming of the sin example sloth you move slower the longer the fight occurs for. When you begin the game your only weapon is a pistol called humility. Your goal is to kill 3 sins to rise back up to heaven before it's too late.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Shooter- One of the main 2 gameplay modes is a top down shooter. When you enter one of the sin\u2019s rooms you may have to use your pistol humility to defeat an onslaught of enemies or one hulking foe in order to slay the sin.\r\n</p>\n<p>Puzzle- The other main style of gameplay is a puzzle. Where instead of using your brawn, you must use your brain. These puzzles can range widely from having to choose an item based on hints or follow a pattern of tiles. These puzzles will greatly test the players wit and skill.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Choice- When you first start the game 3 doors will be in front of you each corresponding to a sin allowing the player to choose which sin they would like to fight first. After defeating each sin you will be sent back to this room allowing the player to take on the sins in any order they so choose. This room will also allow players to test the mechanics in a safe environment.\r\n</p>\n<p>Goal- As stated before in sinsational your main goal is to defeat 3\u00a0sins in any order you so choose.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T20:26:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2d70050a7a0eb2787ebb2fc3ccc755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GTG Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
