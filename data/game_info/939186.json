I landed on the design for Smash Captains after binging\u00a0Summoning Salt's speedrun videos and reading about the strange story behind\u00a0Todd Rogers's alleged Barnstorming high score. I wanted to make a game where you race against the clock, that had a retro influenced style, and that felt firmly modern in some ways. I had been tinkering with voxel art visuals for a while and was eager to make something using Magicavoxel and in 3D. The result of all of this was Smash Captains, a colorful voxel art racing game.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY<br/></strong>Hold space to give your wobbly plane thrust as you race to the finish line.
