I LOVE my connection. By the way, the theme was \"Out Of Control\" and, in this game,\u00a0you have to fix the rails to\u00a0NOT let the train go \"out of control\"!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>The gameplay is very simple. You just have to click when you see a rail out of place and keep it pressed until you have positioned it correctly. The green arrows indicate the rail you can click on, be careful to click ONLY the rails out of place! If you play the game, remember to share your best score in the comments below :)<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:43:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/773b54d4d725f79c4d31522cecbac069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MonteDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
