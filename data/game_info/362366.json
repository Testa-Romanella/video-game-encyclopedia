The only way to free 1, is by using 1's own mass as a\u00a0centrifugal force. 1's only ability is to repel or attract its mass to and from the wall.\u00a0 If 1 is not careful, the wall of dark matter can\u00a0engulf the integer in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>There is currently no ending to this game as it\u00a0is endless and becomes increasingly harder to progress.\u00a0\u00a0The point system is in\u00a0\u03c0, a half rotation (180 degrees).\u00a0The current record is 138\u03c0,\u00a0Do you have what it takes to beat the highscore?

However, one\u00a0of the motivations for the creation of\u00a0this game was the exprimentation with sound. As I have never really used Processings Sound Library. I have most reacently become facinated by what music can do to enhance visual content. With the main contender being Hans\u00a0Zimmer's score for Dunkirk. Where the use of Shepard Tone can make the movie expirence so much more intense, just by the use of audio. So I sat out to implement the Shepard Tone\u00a0this for the simple game concept, trying to give the sense of endlessness, eternity, struggle and dispair.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T02:53:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbde6727cec5c4c2e02340aa77cb9a2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkPhlox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
