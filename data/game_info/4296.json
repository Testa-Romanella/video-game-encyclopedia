Amihama\u2019s downtown area has slowly been converted to a \u201cLittle Britain,\u201d complete with European-styled buildings, occupied by an influx of adventurous foreign settlers.  Not everyone welcomes these new residents though, and three distinct factions with opposing ideals begin to take shape.<br />\nYou must take on the role of a master-less samurai looking to establish yourself in this conflicted land of opportunity and uncertainty.  It is up to you to decide which faction to support in an almighty conflict amongst the region\u2019s three powers, and so direct the course of Japan\u2019s history.<br />\nWill you aid the shogunate pro-government in their attempts to keep the peace and establish cordial relations with the foreign contingent?<br />\nWill you help the nationalistic isolationists in their attempts to exile this potential threat to the Japanese way of life?<br />\nOr will you ally with the foreigners directed by the British Navy in their attempts to establish silk trade and foster cultural exchange?<br />\nWho will you support? Who will you betray?  Become the ultimate bastion of virtue or the ultimate disgrace to humanity, and do it however you&#39;d like.
