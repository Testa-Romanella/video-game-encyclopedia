By constantly transforming, you can manipulate how these two powers interact to slay your enemies and complete your mission.</p>\r\n\r\nKickstarter\r\n<p>I'm the sole developer for Arbiter and in addition to my own savings, I'm currently funding its development through <strong>Kickstarter</strong>! \u00a0The game pretty much lives and dies by the Kickstarter's success, so please consider supporting it if you're interested!</p>\r\nSUPPORT ON KICKSTARTER\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n<p>The demo is a polished, fully playable tutorial level that will most likely appear in the final game. It's about 15-20m long, filled with various enemy encounters and a boss at the end. \u00a0The game is currently only supported on <strong>Windows (PC)</strong>.</p>\n<p>I recommend playing with a controller since that was the tutorials are specified for. The game is still fully playable with keyboard and mouse, however, and you can see the control layout for those here.</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Jumping on top of multiple enemies will get you stuck falling between them.</li><li>Small terrain piece sticking out in Wolf's arena, to the right of the grey wall.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Feel free to play the game, stream it, record it, whatever you wish! \u00a0I'd love to get as much feedback as possible to help make it as good as it can be. \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n<p>Twitter: \u00a0@jordy_j_s<br/>Facebook: \u00a0/arbitergame/<br/>Email: \u00a0jordyjs.biz@gmail.com<br/>Website: \u00a0https://arbitergame.ca/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-17T10:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c473f379416b9f3c424b18de47355f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JordyJS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
