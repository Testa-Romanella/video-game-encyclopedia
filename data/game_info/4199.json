{"id": 4199, "slug": "littlebigplanet-karting", "name": "LittleBigPlanet Karting", "name_original": "LittleBigPlanet Karting", "description": "<p>LittleBigPlanet Karting is an arcade racing game developed by United Front Games in collaboration with the creators of the original LittleBigPlanet, MediaMolecule.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In LittleBigPlanet Karting, the players compete with each other on several thematic tracks. The objective of each race is to get to the finish first. During the race, the players can pick up such weapons as thermal-guided missiles, EMPs, grenades, and so on. These weapons can be used both for offense or defense. For example, the player can shoot the rocket coming onto them with his own rocket and evade the attack. There are also boosters on the track, such as Nitro or Autopilot. The game features a grappling hook from LittleBigPlanet 2, which is used to pass obstacles during the race. It is also possible to hit a rival with it if they are close enough.</p>\n<p>Unlike most racing games, LittleBigPlanet Karting puts a heavy emphasis on the number of game modes: Battle Mode, Waypoint Races, Treasure Hunts, Score Attacks and much more modes are available to the players.</p>\n<p>Like in the other LittleBigPlanet games, the community-made content plays a vital role in the game&#39;s philosophy, which is described as \u201cPlay, create, share.\u201d The players can customize their characters, edit the tracks or create their own maps from the ground up. It is possible to set up your own rules in the track creator. The game features asynchronous multiplayer and tracks made by the community which were included in the main map pool.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T04:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/7494d29011ddec57b1aa5896dd4bf266.jpg", "website": "http://www.littlebigplanet.com/karting/", "rating": 3.09, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 753, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 74, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 148, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 148, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "United Front Games", "Media Molecule"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
