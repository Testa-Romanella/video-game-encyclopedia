I worked on this game with a team of 3 other people (Matan Botansky, Sean Brill, and Justin Kelly). My main role on this project was creating the UI and integrating it into gameplay, as well as handling the game over and extra life states. I created a shader for the side meters using Unity's Shader Graph system, and in order to upload this I had to recreate the model for the inner tube bumpers, which were not properly uploaded to our version control.</p>\n<p>There are some known and unfixed bugs in this project that will remain unfixed, including the ball occasionally clipping through the plungers and quirks of the custom gravity handling my teammates developed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd8301f54b022ad2c2787ae5c3935e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benhommrich"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
