It put me into mood for some deep thoughts. So as usual I picked up my guitar and started playing some improvisation on We Were Promised Jetpacks to keep the thoughts flowing. I was just sitting there alone playing, thinking and then I decided to capture the feeling of the moment (and to test some Unity lighting features as well).</p>\n<p>And this came out.</p>\n\r\nYou can interact with everything except the coffee and the cookies.\r\nAnd be sure to check out that friend of mine who's comic is featured (with permission) in this \"experience\".<br/>\n<p>It's all in Russian so be warned. But again, the imagery and animations are international so you can still take a look even if you don't know the language.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ec2bf88ca04959ce816d9a3645f56d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dashing Ashes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
