Like any good horror film, you're not alone. </p><p>You'll need to navigate through the various parts of the rig in an attempt to reach the radio tower to call for rescue. At the same time you'll be dealing with a life threatening wound suffered prior to the start of the game. This wound requires the player to constantly compress it to prevent the loss of blood. Letting go of the wound will allow you to use both your hands, but you will lose blood more quickly as a result.</p><p>Made by 6 VFS Game Design students over a three month development cycle. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b386fc7189be8b73c0f869325f30942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daffodil", "TrashCastle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
