The gameplay is really hard and tedious, but the player is constantly rewarded by a voice encouraging or provoking them to go further ! We tried to have a really mesmerizing mountain, quite dreamy, to push the player to advance and discover what's at the end of their task !</p><p>Game Design, some of the art and the sound design on this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba442dff99d4cdeb8720d06607a9c549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hadrien Basch - Game Designer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
