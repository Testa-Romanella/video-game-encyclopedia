Standing between you and your horse is a treacherous forest filled with beasts and guards attempting to stop you in your path!\u00a0\r\nYour only weapon: Elemental Magic\r\n<p>Combine two of the four primal elements to cast spells and defeat your enemies. But be careful, as the elements are unstable to wield. You only have a limited time to create your spell every time you summon the elements, and if you fail to combine elements in time, they will backfire in your face and hurt you. However, should you succeed to create a spell in time, you'll be able to cast a wide variety of different spells with varying effects.</p>\r\nTwo Game Modes\r\n<p>Unfabled has two game modes that play largely the same, <strong>Adventure</strong> and <strong>Survival</strong>. In Adventure mode, your goal is to complete all 20 waves of enemies to save your horse. In Survival mode, your goal is to survive for as long as you can.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p><strong>LSHIFT</strong>: Open the element menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>: Select your elements.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>LMB</strong>: Cast your spell.\u00a0</p>\r\nHave fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/647e24e43c18128effc2c1cacb7c5299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kwiper", "KybreX", "coelakan", "chip2222"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
