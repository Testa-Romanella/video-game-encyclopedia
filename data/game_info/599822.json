The Alpha Male Squadron", "description": "<p><strong>Plot:</strong></p><p>Ryu, Ken Chun Li, Cammy, and the others have been trying to finish off M.Bison and his evil Shadaloo organization for years, and they have\u00a0never seemed able to finish them off for good. Even though their intentions are noble, their inability to rid the world of evil has only\u00a0kept evil coming back, bigger, stronger and more ruthless, with the general populace having to pay the price every single time in blood.</p>\n<p>This gave rise to a new popular movement within the general public. One which wouldn't rely on ineffective heroes to save them from evil forces.</p>\n<p>This group of ambitious individuals called themselves the \"Alpha Male Squadron\" to accentuate their superiority and utter manliness.</p>\n<p>However, in secrecy, this was just a devious plan to get rid of both Shadaloo and their opponents to grab all the power in the world for themselves.</p>\n<p>With these secrets known to Ryu, his friends, and even his enemies, they pledged to set aside their differences for now and team up against this new foe.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>- 21 Characters from the Street Fighter Universe</p><p>- 21 New opponents for our protagonists to face</p><p>- A total roster of 42 characters to choose from</p><p>- Every character has their own unique stage, even the Alpha Male Squadron fighters</p><p>- Lots of memes, ironic humor, and personality goes into each fighter</p><p>- 2 Separate Story Modes:</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- A 1 vs 1,\u00a0 14-match story mode where you play as any character to help\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the Street Fighter characters\u00a0defeat the Alpha Male Squadron</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-A 2 vs 2, 10-match team story mode where you play as any characters to\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0help the Alpha Male Squadron defeat the Street Fighter characters</p><p>- Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series lol</p><p><strong>Character List:</strong><br/></p><p> Street Fighter Characters:\u00a0</p><p>Chun Li, Cammy, Ryu, Ken, Zangief, Dhalsim, E.Honda, Blanka, Guile, Balrog, M.Bison, Vega, T.Hawk, Fei Long, Sagat, Kolin, R.Mika, Ibuki, Juri Han, El Fuerte, Sakura, Dan, Dudley, Rolento, Q, Cody, C.Viper, Rashid, Poison, and DeeJay.</p><p>\u00a0Alpha Male Squadron Characters:</p><p>DIO Garfield, Dio Brando, Jotaro Kujo, Inferno Cop, Pingu, Peter Griffin, Shaq, Fat Albert, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Ronald McDonald, Colonel Sanders, Demitri Maximoff, Shadow the Hedgehog, Ragna the Bloodedge, Sans, Beavis, Butthead, Annoying Orange, EAT PANT/Bartman, Michael Jackson, Pepsiman, Niko Bellic, Claude Speed, The Imposter from Among Us, Dee Bee Kaw, Dink Smallwood, and Dante from the Devil May Cry Series.</p><p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br/></p><p>-In the character select screen there are two options for both Dio Brando and Jotaro Kujo. This is because one is a playable version of them, that the player can control, and the other is an AI enhanced version that does not allow the player to control it.</p><p>- This game is pretty much just a shitpost, so alot of the roster choices were just memes that I thought would be funny if they fought the Street Fighter characters.</p><p>-Despite being a shitpost, I did put in the effort to find the characters with the best AI to put in the game. The Street Fighters have pretty difficult AI, and the Alpha Male Squadron characters also have pretty difficult AI as well. After testing and tweaking, I ensured it was plenty difficult to pose a challenge, but not too challenging.</p><p>-Also this is a mugen game, and I the authors of the characters are credited in their respective def files in the char folder.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Hopefully, you find this game of mine interesting, as I had fun making it, as I do with all the shitposty games I make for fun. If you like it, download it, and have fun and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bf75ce0301aeaab6e699943e9abece9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nicaea Trabzon"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
