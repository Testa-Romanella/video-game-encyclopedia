You can get some score and copying it as a number, in case you need to know your high-score (this game doesn't save any data).</p>\n<p>There are 14 variations of fruit, you have to\u00a0discover them!</p>\n<p>You need to be careful though, fruit can fightback too, they're going to wait and rush to you with big speed to damage you. If your health reaches 0, you lose.</p>\n<p>When you destroy some fruit, with 25% chance you can get a healing bonus from them, just like in real-life, fruit is healthy for you.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Arrow keys: move</p>\n<p>Space bar: shoot</p>\r\nThat's the whole game, pretty simple, but enjoyable\r\n<p>Enjoy playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T11:31:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/608390ab42a11b96dc8fbcfc0e9615bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DevRodasToo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
