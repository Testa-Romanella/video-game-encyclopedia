I have learned a lot since then. This is the first good game I have published to a community. Hopefully you like it.</p>\n<p>I am not finished with this game and it will continue to get updates. However I am now also working on another game, the prequel to this one, so get ready for that, well okay it wont be ready for a while, but look forward to it!</p>\r\n\r\nControls: \r\n<ol><li>White Circle: Controller 1, or WASD.</li><li>Red Square: Controller 2, or TFGH.</li><li>Green Square: Controller 3, or IJKL.</li><li>Blue Square: Controller 4, or Arrow Keys.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nObject:\r\n<p><strong>White Circle: </strong>Catch the other players before the time runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>Colored Squares:</strong> Run from the white circle until the time runs out.</p>\r\n\r\nOdd Colored Round Circles:\r\n<p>Running over (grabbing) these will make you mostly invisible for about 15 seconds.
