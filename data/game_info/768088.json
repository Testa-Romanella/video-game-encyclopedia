Large publishers have ignored this genre for years so we are picking up the torch! BangBang PewPew features 25+ lightgun shooting challenges. We have created unique original challenges that push the genre in new directions like infinite running, driving and curling with a gun. We have also updated and redesigned many of the classics: skeet shooting, sport shooting and on-rails combat.<br/><br/>BangBang PewPew was successfully funded on Kickstarter and is coming to Steam in Spring 2022.<br/><br/>BangBang PewPew is build from the ground-up for lightguns and it supports mouse input as well. We strongly recommend a lightgun and it has been tested on the Sinden Lightgun, Aimtrak, AE Lightgun and Gun4IR.<h3>Features in the Initial Release</h3><ul><li>25 challenges<br/></li><li>Unique shooting challenges like infinite running with a lightgun, driving with a lightgun over your wheel or poker with a gun.
