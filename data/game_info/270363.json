Run through levels, collect coins, diamonds and other power ups. Jump on top of enemies to defeat them. Dive into the water to find hidden areas!\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a complete remake of the PC version originally released in 1996 for MS-DOS. The game is nearly identical, but some small changes have been made. This version does not use separate buttons to walk slower or faster, some levels were modified a bit to make everything work well with the constant walking speed. Also, there have been some small changes to make the game a little easier and less frustrating. And now there is also background music!</p>\n<p>[Left] and [Right]: walk<br/>[Up] / [Space]: jump<br/>[Down]: in some places Charlie can dive into the water</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/cae080285f33a69bd307c67acc7f5b19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wiering Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
