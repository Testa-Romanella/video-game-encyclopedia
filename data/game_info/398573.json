Anyway this is something I would like to receive feedback. How the dissiculty scales and when It starts to become easier as there is too much empty space on the map.</p>\n<p>I would like some feedback about the level generation and how the games feels aswell.\u00a0</p><p>https://itch.io/embed-upload/1843093?color=333333<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:26:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1571d3571dfba1363468f2b17c3f4fa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dukebot"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
