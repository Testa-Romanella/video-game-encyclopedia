Eliminate a specific combination of ghosts every 10 seconds to keep playing. You must eliminate the combo ghosts in order, from left to right, without touching or hitting any other ghosts in between. Otherwise, your combo will reset. To eliminate ghosts, swat them with your Cyber Broom, run against them, dive kick on them or vaporize them with your Cyber Blast.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Movement \u2013 WASD \u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump and Double Jump \u2013 Space (Hold OK)\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Attack with Cyber Broom \u2013 Left-click \u00a0</p>\n<p>Cyber Blast \u2013 Right-click \u00a0</p>\n<p>Divekick \u2013 S (in air) \u00a0</p>\n<p>Wallclimb \u2013 Hold A (left wall), Hold D (right wall), Hold Space (ceiling)</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>\n<p>1. Try cleaning the arena a bit before eliminating combo ghosts. This makes it easier to navigate the arena.</p>\n<p>2. Use Cyber Blast to clear the way. Eliminating ghosts with these abilities won\u2019t reset your combo. It does have a cooldown though, so be careful!</p>\n<p>3. Use Double Jump, Wall Climb to navigate to hard-to-reach ghosts.</p>\n<p>4. You can collect your combo with Divekick, and it doesn't reset your combo either!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T13:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f1/0f10d7381f535d3ea975979c3acd84de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LoHii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
