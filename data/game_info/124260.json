Good thing is it's very extensible and easy to add new block types. Apologies for the unclean presentation aspects of the splash menu and others.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>To run the game you need L\u00d6VE2D 11.0 and execute love lgj18.love. It is important that you execute the .love with the levels folder near it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0cc74d72c569e593c156a048766e5f28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["alesegdia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
