These beings recreated themselves so many times, so then the earth didn't have enough resources for both humans and\u00a0Olids. War broke out between both factions and somehow the human race lost and was forced to the southern hemisphere of the planet, while the\u00a0Olids occupied the northern\u00a0hemisphere. The Olids used so much\u00a0natural materials from their part, they had to make flowing cities that flout from the ground to keep the population alive.</p>\n<p>While some\u00a0Olids are against humans, some believe that they are the most important species on the planet and that they need to be treated equally. So some\u00a0Olids went to the south to protect the human race and bring them safety. There were\u00a0also rumours of a so-called \"Star Knight\", an Olid with cosmic powers that would come and ends the\u00a0northern\u00a0Olid's reign across the planet.</p>\n<p>This is Ella, the main character of the game, in the story, she is the so-called\u00a0\"Star Knight\", we will follow her through the game, and we will see her becoming her own\u00a0Olid that can make her own decisions.</p>\n\n<p>This is Uno and A\u00f1os (And yes, they were inspired by Unus Annus), they are twins that have completely different personalities, Unes is smart and competent, he tries to get A\u00f1os out of trouble and makes sure that no one messes with him. While A\u00f1os is optimistic and shy, he tries to make sure that everyone is falling great! He also has a big crush on Ella.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't give a name to this one or an official render, so il use this art that I made 2 years ago. She is a mentor/guide for Ella, showing her how her power work and how to control them.</p>\n<p>The game would have more characters if it was a full game.</p>\n<p>Through the game, we would see the earth on both\u00a0hemispheres, showing the good and bad intentions of control they have...</p>\n\n<p>I still want to continue the game, but not in the way I made it, but il keep that in mind for the near future...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T13:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07d/07ddcd074f6ed02659ee7ee9a13054ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blue team"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
