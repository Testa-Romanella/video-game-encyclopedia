Any enemy that is touched by the tether will be destroyed and earn you points, but if any block on either side is touched by an enemy or bullet, it's game over. Also keep in mind that the tether does have a length limit, so watch out or you might get stuck in some jank.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>The blue square will be controlled using WASD, and the red square can be controlled using Arrow Keys. If you don't have arrow keys or simply want to use a mouse to control the red square, enable it in the in-game pause menu (Press tab or escape to get this pause menu).</p>\n\n<p>Types of enemies:</p>\n<p>Rhombus Boys - The square lookin fellows are hard headed and will just charge at your straight on, destroy them for a hopefully\u00a0easy 25 points.</p>\n<p>Mines - These are the hexagonal looking blocks, while relatively unmoving and dormant, these will explode when touched and cannot be destroyed by the tether. Watch out as they will slowly start to overtake the screen.</p>\n<p>Circle Ones - These ones are annoying and even I hate them.\u00a0They just kinda shoot little bullets at you which are slow enough to dodge but fast enough to catch you off guard.</p>\n\n<p>Credits!</p>\n<p>Any art (or lack thereof) is made by me</p>\n<p>The in-game music is made by my neighbor</p>\n<p>Sounds effects are from mixkit, zapsplat, and from Harvey656's 8-bit sound effect collection.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab011d400b17055bc333135df3066d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yeperdeedooda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
