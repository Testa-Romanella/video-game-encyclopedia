{"id": 747788, "slug": "run-me-my-money", "name": "Run Me My Money", "name_original": "Run Me My Money", "description": "<p>Run Me My Money is a short 2D platformer built around sharp, fluid movement and a combo-based combat system.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong></p>\n<p>The primary movement mechanic in this game is Kicking. While touching a wall\u00a0or over a kickable object, you can press jump and hold a direction to kick in that direction. If you do this multiple times, your momentum is conserved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>\n<p>The player has access to different directional attacks both in the air and on the ground. Each attack has its own\u00a0unique knock-back angle, strength, and damage which allow the player to string them together into combos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Combos</strong></p>\n<p>We wanted to encourage creative combos,\u00a0so enemies have too much health to be killed with any single move\u00a0and will recover quickly unless they are kept in hit-stun. Enemies are also kickable objects while they're in hit-stun so you can do some really crazy stuff with enough practice and precision.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:31:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02a/02a252ec191778b1250c4b589b5dd2e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Harryacorn2"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
