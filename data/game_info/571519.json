As you can't really see what is going on, use your senses to be able to decide who to let in, who to reject. While Blind Bouncer: A Story has no branching narrative, it has several different endings.   </p>\n<p>You will probably not reach the desired ending the first run.\r\n </p>\n<p>The story has many alternate fiction elements and some references that would help players visualize scenes by referring to their movie and book memories.\r\n </p>\n<p>The game is developed by a single developer, me, who thought of gamifying a story that I wrote. By no means it is a fully developed game that has \"cool\" features. It is a very simple game that will catch you with its story or not.\r\n </p>\n<p>Blind Bouncer: A Story first launched on a mobile platform but the Windows and Mac port does not have any ads or in-game purchases; it is completely free.\r\n </p>\n<p>Soon I will release another game which will be a more in-depth developed game please sign up to my mailing list in-game or from the Worthy Game website.\r\n </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game.\r\n </p>\n<p>Cheers.\r\n </p>\n<p>Features\r\n </p>\n<p> - Many different endings.\r\n </p>\n<p> - Math-puzzle like advancement.\r\n </p>\n<p> - Movie and book references.\r\n </p>\n<p> - Approx. 10k words story.\r\n </p>\n<p> - Nice song.\r\n </p>\n<p> - Simple but different.\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T09:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/2030105c39bc8e31b73c2abf019b3d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["worthygame"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
