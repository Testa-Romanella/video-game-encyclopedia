In a good manner, you steal the truck to drive through the hell-highway that is the Swedish E10. While escaping from the angry hunters, whose truck you stole, you collect goodies, avoid obstacles and hit the poor fools who decided to cross your path. Survive your ride from T\u00f6re to Kiruna!\r\n</p>\n<p>You control the car by pressing Left and right (or A and D) on your keyboard. Your goal is to reach Kiruna while dodging the obstacles like the potholes and roadconstruction signs. Get hit too many times and you trash the car, making you lose the game. To make things more spicy, you can drive over the pedestrians to gain extra points. You can also run into the grass, however don't stay there too long. You lose points otherwise!\r\n</p>\n<p>Hit n Run is a game developed in the Arctic Game Jam 2021. The theme presented in this jam was \u201cNorrland\u201d which is the northern part of Sweden. The game was made during the weekend of May 7th to May 9th.\u00a0When making this game we chanted to make it with a hidden meaning. With the E10, we joke about how for example northern roads aren\u2019t prioritised and how we humans just run animals over. The game engine used was Unity. The group working on this game consisted of 8 members, each working with different parts of the game.
