{"id": 284725, "slug": "tanks-on-the-eastern-front", "name": "Tanks on the Eastern Front", "name_original": "Tanks on the Eastern Front", "description": "Tanks On The Eastern Front is an arcade tactical game. Can you win in deadly circumstances of World War 2 on the eastern front? Or will you end up as a charred corpse in burned down tank? ... while trying not to be hit or, if that fails, to be hit.<br/><br/>Everything a real tank can destroy with its gun or its tracks can also be destroyed in the game world \u2013 trees, buildings, cars. You start with basic German tanks but with time and resources you can get better ones (such as Konigs Tiger) to fight the deluge of Red Army tanks.<br/><br/>Tanks On The Eastern Front was born of the desire to make a game that utilizes tanks in isometric view allowing player to resolve tactical problems with better God-like vision of the battlefield. <br/>As a persons intrested in ww2 games, we felt a lack of that kind of game. In addition threre are so few games about war on the Eastern Front where so fierce and large battles took place. We wanted to create a game that allows player to fight both arcade and tactical, yet with the lighter toon and low-poly style. Tanks On The Eastern Front is our attempt at achieving this goal. Tank driving skill and utilization of environement in battle rule the day. No random deaths - there is always a way out, for the skilled player!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5ceb8037abbc08545539ae61293784.jpg", "website": "http://tanksontheeasternfront.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grippen's Castle"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grippen's Castle"], "esrb_rating": null}
