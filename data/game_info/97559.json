All options can be changed from within the game. I plan to patch this tomorrow</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This morning you woke up in less pain than usual. You decide to use these precious spare spoons to clean the house - or at least to make a start. With your cane in your left hand, you only have one hand free to carry things.\u00a0 Stack things in your free hand to minimize trips and get the house as clean as you can.</p>\n<p>As a sufferer of chronic pain, your life is made of concessions and small victories.\u00a0 Make today's small victory a nicer living space for yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>I Do This Every Day is a short game based on my experiences both as a spoonie and as a cane user. I made this game to vent my frustrations and to make my condition and the condition of others like me understandable to non-spoonies.</p>\n<p><strong>What Are Spoons?</strong></p>\n<p>Spoon theory is the idea of limited energy of people with chronic illness.\u00a0 A person has a limited number of metaphorical \"spoons\" that are used up by completing simple tasks such as cleaning a plate or even walking. When spoons are expended, they can only be regained by resting.</p>\n<p>Co<strong>ntent warnings:</strong> This game features food and food waste.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> This game has no voiced lines and no time limit. Nothing is dependant on colours and the keys are remappable (hold shift on startup).
