Use the dynamic nailing system to come up with creative ways to defend yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>This demo is in beta.</strong> The gameplay features are all implemented but I am still polishing mechanics and finding issues. Let me know if you find problems or think something should change to improve gameplay. Once I\u00a0fix major issues and polish some mechanics I will start developing more content (lots more weapons/tools and bigger levels) to eventually release an early access version onto Steam.</p>\n<p>Steam page:\u00a0http://store.steampowered.com/app/682140/Undead_Development/</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Pausing the game when enabling controllers can cause both hands to map onto one controller. Restart the game while both controllers are already turned on.</li><li>Some colliders will not line up with the art making nailing awkward.</li><li>You can lose items to the floor a bit too easily.</li><li>Pushing the nailing system to its limits (however small) and you'll probably get some weird stuff happening.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7dbf04db5e548a62f84d9ecfb228fc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ladrik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
