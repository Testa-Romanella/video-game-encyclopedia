{"id": 552045, "slug": "1-ctrl", "name": "1 CTRL", "name_original": "1 CTRL", "description": "<p>This my submission to the Blackthornprod \"Less is more\" GameJam!</p>\n<p><strong>Concept</strong>: the game is a very short puzzle-platformer in which you control a small robot - 'Minus' - through a set of simplistic test chambers. The twist is that you can only press one button... the CTRL key. The player must therefore hit the button a certain number of times in order to tell the robot what to do, which is challenging due to timing and coordination.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> When I first saw the theme of the GameJam, \"Less is more\" I innitially thought of some sort of time-based trial, where taking less time allows you to do more. After exploring this idea a little, I decided it was too obvious of a take. I instead experimented with taking away mechanics. My idea for this game was to introduce mechanics and puzzles, all with only one actual input. In this way, the game uses 'less' to do 'more'.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Art &amp; Design:\u00a0</strong>obviously, I stuck with a very simplistic theme for the art in the game. It was interesting to make a game which was only black and white (except for the occasional pale yellow) and I think I did a pretty decent Job.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Process</strong>: This was my first ever GameJam, and I had a great time participating. I have a lot going on at the moment, which means\u00a0the project is largely unfinished and buggy due to running out of time, but\u00a0I'm still looking forward to seeing feedback and\u00a0improving my developing skills in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:22:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb1ba3cee6e766918c2c9ac856e751d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PyroHazard"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
