The game is evidently inspired by the Atari classic, even containing its own white-outlined chunks of space rock that subdivide when shot by the player. Unlike Asteroids, however, blasting Bezier's meteoroids will release a triangular 'Firefly', which follows and fights alongside the player. In this and a dozen other ways Bezier elevates Atari's initial concept, transforming that elegantly spartan shoot 'em up into a thrilling kaleidoscope of breathless mayhem.\" - Rick Lane, Bit-Tech</p>\n<p>\r\n\"It's a hectic twin-stick shooter that has effortlessly swallowed my entire morning, and is probably going to eat up most of the evening too.\" - <strong><em>Christian Donlan, Eurogamer</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Bezier is a shiny twin-stick shooter, complete with all the explosions and mayhem that entails, and it's very good at that. What it adds on top of that is a story told only in snippets at the beginning of each stage. At least, to start with. When it starts reinforcing the story through gameplay, the cruelty of the villain becomes more than just words.\" - \r\n\t<strong><em>Lena LeRay, Indie Games</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\"It all makes for a captivating, unique and slightly unhinged experience. And I love it so very much.\" - <strong><em>Rob Fearon, Retro Remakes</em></strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"The soundtrack itself is worthy of praise. I paid the extra few dollars in order to get it, even though I had no idea if it'd be any good, and I'm glad I did. It's phenomenal.\" - \r\n\t<strong><em>Tyler Selig, MediaDetour</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Bezier is a fast paced twin stick Geometry Wars-Style blaster full of varied enemy design, frantic gameplay and more visual flair than a burning Lamborghini filled with fireworks and glitter.\" - \r\n\t<strong><em>Calum Fraser, AlphaBetaGamer</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It's beautiful and more than a little wacky.\" - <strong><em><em>Ben Barrett, Rock Paper Shotgun</em></em> </strong></p>\n\r\nLinks\r\n<p><strong>Bezier Official Site</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Follow Niine.Games @ Twitter</strong><br/></p>\n\r\nPlayer Feedback<br/>\n<p>\"Outstanding. Here's an example of a game that both quintessentially represents, as well as broadens its genre. If you enjoy dual stick shooters, this is unmissable.\" - <strong><em>Gabrienb @ Steam</em></strong></p>\n<p>\"Gave the game a try. Just wanted to take a quick look as I didn't have enough time to really get into it. Felt like I wouldn't be able to stop playing unless the world ended. This game is awesome.\" - <strong><em>Germaximus @ Steam</em></strong></p>\n<p>\"Great fun. I've been waiting for this game for ages and it doesn't disappoint. Very fast moving and addictive. There's no time to rest, there's enemies to kill!\" - <strong><em>ash @ Steam</em></strong></p>\n<p>\"Is it that good you ask?...why yes..yes it is. This may well be in the top 5 twin sticks I've played and yes I've played alot over the past 35 years of gaming starting with Robotron at the age of 4.\" - <strong><em>Fishsticks @ Steam</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"All I can say in the end is it reminds me of all those days I spent playing away on the machines at my granda's old arcade. That alone makes this wonderful for me.\" - <strong><em>GeT_JoYe @ Steam</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"Gorgeous Neon effects hectic action and LOTS of enemies to take out followed by an epic soundtrack. If you like twin stick shooters like Geometry Wars you'll love this. I've only been playing for 1 hour (lol) at the time of typing this and I already know I'm going to get a lot of enjoyment here. Do I recommend it? I most certainly do :D 9/10\" - <strong><em>TheEndlessVortex @ Steam</em></strong></p>\n<p>\"Beautiful game with a fantastic soundtrack. I'm a sucker for twin-stick shooters and this tried to bring something different to the market with the story.\" - <strong><em>fnminman @ Steam</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"Interesting twin stick shooter with slick graphics, fun, tough gameplay and great music.\" - mojoxrisen @ Steam Greenlight</p>\n<p>\"The game is really, really amazing - looks great, sounds great (soundtrack is on Bandcamp if you'd like to preview it) - loads of original ideas etc. Can't recommend this enough\" - shrewdlogarithm @ Steam Greenlight</p>\n<p>\"I seen it for 30 sec and bought it and let me tell you is pretty amazing.. it brings an excitement games of this type do not have. Vote for this game I highly recommended. Music is pretty awesome too.. One of the best sound tracks I heard this year.\" - Knight-Crawler @ Steam Greenlight</p>\n<p>\"I bought it on Desura and I would buy it again on Steam to support the developer. This is unabashed old school gaming madness!\" - jcaracc2003 @ Steam Greenlight</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Holy crap this game is great This is the twin stick shooter evolved Took a few minutes to get my head round it, but once I did - OMFG Beautiful art style, OUTSTANDING soundtrack and really tight gameplay - Love it to bits\" - Midian808 @ Desura<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Just played the demo.

About to purchase...\" - IronSoldier @ Eurogamer\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Love it!\" - kirkblack70 @ Desura\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"A really fun and beautiful game, that you seem to have really well polished during your 6 years development process.\" - MrModeste @ Desura\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Read about this on Rock Paper Shotgun and had to check it out, and I'm very glad I did. Great looking, amazing music and quality voice work. I love the visual design.\" - alffly @ Desura\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Holy crap this game is great. The soundtrack alone is enough to justify a download\" - DYFE @ Desura</p>\n\r\nThe Blaster Is A Dying Heart<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tBezier is a dual stick blaster set inside a vast computer built deep underground. The story traces the principal's escape from this \"Noah's Ark\" gone wrong. A simple shooter on the surface, the deeper narrative pulls in his relationship between evolution and god, family and love. These themes question his motives, force him to confront what is real and lead him to salvation.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPowered by the BezierSynth traditional rendering is renounced in favour of a fluid aesthetic guided by story elements, player interaction and the audio engine. An eighty minute soundtrack blends together orchestra, synthesizers and many ethnic instruments to drive the drama through fifteen zones. Almost one hundred different enemies, voice acting, reward based achievements and different game modes make Bezier the mindless blaster with a big heart.\r\n</p>\n\r\nSupport\r\n<p>If you have any problems with Bezier then firstly, I'm very sorry that has happened. It is certainly not supposed to. Secondly, please get in touch with me at <strong>contact@niinegames.com</strong> and I will do my best to sort that out.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: The game on sale here is the Steam version only.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c96e28429bc85537b283be921877b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["niinegames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
