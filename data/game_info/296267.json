With this Augmented Reality  App, bring the enemy into your home and then make him sorry he showed up! This is a wave-based defensive format with waves of enemy attacks that get progressively more difficult. AR Drone Commander has multiple weaponry options, 6 unique levels and each level has 10 waves and ends with a boss just like the arcade style games that we all love. Use the scaling function to play on a table top, an open indoor space, or scale up to max in an open outdoor area for maximum size and effect. Performance may suffer on some older devices.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d476a659383402ada79ffd7db43bf9_LOGYKNg.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHvOleM9GHU&feature=youtu.be", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Applings Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Applings Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
