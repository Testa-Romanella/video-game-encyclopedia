I worked on this game specifically for the 2022 Otter Jam on and off over the course of two weeks. This is the first complete game that I've made, as well as the first game jam that I've entered. It's something that I'm really proud of, and I'm excited for everyone to see what sort of creatures are lurking in the deep!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T23:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d80f5deb1b9fd8a4cfede50bcba015a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The \"George\""], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
