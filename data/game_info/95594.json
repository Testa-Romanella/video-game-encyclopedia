Trapped in\u00a0an alien maze, you're forced to survive as long as you can. Run around collecting keys and vaporizing all the baddies that get in your way. The longer you stay alive, the more bad vibes you crush, the higher your score when you win.\u00a0<strong>BAD VIBES</strong> is pure shooter madness, the way it was intended to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----</p>\r\nTOP 20 HIGH SCORES\r\n \r\n \r\n   \r\n          Name\r\n          Score\r\n          Date\r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n1.

It features original music from the archives of Richard Jonas (released under Creative Commons license) and sound effects created with sample packs available for free from Legowelt. A sprite asset from a free\u00a0<em>Wolfenstein 3D </em>mod,\u00a0<em>Planet Nexion</em> (2008), and another from\u00a0<em>Catacomb 3-D</em> (1991)\u00a0were used in this build.\u00a0Aside from any bug fixes, there are currently no plans to continue developing the game, but any feedback is greatly appreciated all the same.
