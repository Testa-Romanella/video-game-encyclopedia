A mysterious man known as <em>ROTH</em> has been rebuilding the Chaos Core, and his ultimate plan arises: The <strong>Metanet Terminal</strong>! His goal is to launch the monstrosity and cause havoc across the land! With the help of the rogue cybernetics distributor <em>IZUKA TEAM</em>, they've sent more Chaos Orbs across the land, and some are even guarded by much bigger threats!
