There are also 6 ready made characters for you to use in your own TTRPG games, stories, or cosplays. The rest of the creation pack can be used to further personalize them. The prompts and tables are setting neutral, so you can use them with any setting, though not every detail will fit every situation.</p>\n<p>Story comes in many forms. It can be expressed through a myriad of colors in a painting, a song rich with feeling, a dramatic voice speaking to an enraptured audience, or countless other methods. This is for any character with a story to tell, a need to be creative, or a drive to inspire others. I\u2019ve kept a loose definition of bard, because there are many ways to be creative and expressive. A bard can travel around singing, or write stories, or express themselves through creating inventions. This supplement endeavors to help you step outside the box of the stereotypical bard, as well as add depth to your character.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T10:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/07308120aa7a200477187d8afb8384c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eliot Silvarian"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
