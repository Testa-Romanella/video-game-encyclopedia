{"id": 891305, "slug": "snoik", "name": "Snoik!", "name_original": "Snoik!", "description": "<p><strong>Snoik!</strong> is a snake-like arcade game where ingenuity and creativity are the keys to victory. <strong>Shift the snake's position</strong>\u00a0at the press of a button and blaze new trails for the highest score possible!\u00a0This project was developed by\u00a0Ash K\u00a0in association with Strangest.io.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In this dynamic twist on an old favorite, players take control of a ever-growing snake that continuously slithers forward. Much like <em>Snake,\u00a0</em>the game is over when you collide with yourself.\u00a0Unlike the classic game, <strong>S</strong><strong>noik!\u00a0</strong>grants players the ability to <strong>weave through parts of the snake</strong>\u00a0for points and clutch saves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Snoik! </strong>is a game of wit and ingenuity. The player-controlled snake will move forward perpetually, and can be steered wherever the player sees fit. At the press of a button, the snake will shift between two <em>layers</em>, allowing it to <strong>cross over parts of its body for points</strong>. When the snake collides with parts of its body on the wrong layer, the game is over!\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\r\nS<strong>noik!\u00a0</strong>features\u00a0two different control schemes, <strong>crank</strong> or <strong>d-pad steering</strong>,\u00a0for increased accessibility.\u00a0At the end of your run, the camera will zoom out to a birds eye view of your snake's route.<strong> Create neat works of art or shoot for the highest score possible</strong>, the choice is yours!\u00a0\r\n\n\n<p><strong>Strangest.io\u2019s prime directive is to empower outsider artists to tell interactive, subversive, and powerful stories.\u00a0</strong>We partner with independent artists on all of our projects. We believe that the best stories and ideas come from the fringes of our society. We are not here to make things that have been done before. We are here to break the mold, leave a mark, and feel good about the work we do.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T03:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f854bae46e8814385add520bbe575555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ash K", "Strangest.io"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
