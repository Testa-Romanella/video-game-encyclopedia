{"id": 105960, "slug": "cis-gaze", "name": "Cis Gaze", "name_original": "Cis Gaze", "description": "<p>In May of 2014, I had a bad experience related to my gender transition that I decided to make into an interactive story. It was surprisingly popular, and is still one of my most-played games to date.</p><p>It's a year later now. I've developed a lot as a woman, as an author, and as a game designer. My transition continues too, but it's very expensive and with other financial pressures still looming, I can't afford to get treatments that help reduce and manage my dysphoria.</p><p>It's with that in mind that I created a remastered, polished version of Cis Gaze with original CSS, art, and music for purchase only. All of the money from the sale of this game will go toward my transition expenses, so please consider donating more than the dollar minimum.</p><p>Thank you so much. &lt;3</p><p>Caelyn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/91429f58999ea5cca53774aae9a0803c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caelyn Sandel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
