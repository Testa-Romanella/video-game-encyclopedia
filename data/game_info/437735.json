You play using two buttons, one to jump and one to place blocks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The levels begin really easy, but get much more difficult as you progress. There are only ten levels at the moment, but I might add more in the future. I've tried to set up each level so you encounter and 'master' each obstacle as you progress through the short courses -- which I'd love to hear your thoughts on!</p>\n<p>Feedback is encouraged and appreciated!\u00a0I hope you guys enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f9468564ae2267edab678b2b507450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skulez"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
