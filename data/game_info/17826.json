{"id": 17826, "slug": "rigit", "name": "RigIT", "name_original": "RigIT", "description": "RigIT is a 3D computer graphics animation tool that automatically rigs skeletons from an animation library to 3D meshes from 3D mesh libraries. RigIT is a fast, high resolution, near pose, automatic rigger that can rig skeletons to meshes with or without well-defined interiors. It allows you to import skeletons and animations from Motion Capture (.bvh) files and automatically rigs them to objects imported from Wavefront (.obj) files that contain a single object mesh.  These rigged meshes can then be exported to a Collada (.dae) file.  RigIT is designed to decrease time to market costs by reducing the time requirement for, and simplifying the process of, assigning animations to computer graphics. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSystem requirements: <br/>\r\nOperating system: Windows 7 or later<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey product features: <br/>\r\nAutomatic rigging of skeletons to meshes <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo see tutorials on how to use RigIT see: <br/>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIiRDJPsojFIja_cDgUwjQw<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor more information see our website: <br/>\r\nhttp://www.rigitgraphics.com/ <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo download Blender for free visit: <br/>\r\nhttp://www.blender.org/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d10bd9eb30c2087c12c35f66d5e9ea11.jpg", "website": "http://www.rigitgraphics.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RigIT"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["RigIT"], "esrb_rating": null}
