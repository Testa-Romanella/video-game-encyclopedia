{"id": 807762, "slug": "shift-for-playdate", "name": "Shift for Playdate", "name_original": "Shift for Playdate", "description": "Shift for Playdate\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Shift is a deceptively simple match-four game for Playdate that requires a little strategy, a small amount of luck and occasionally a deep breath and a fingers-crossed gamble.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            Your task is to shift tiles around the 4x4 grid to get an entire row or column of tiles to be the same color. Tiles will move until they are no longer able, be that by hitting the edge of the grid, or another tile.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            Tiles can be shifted left, right, up and down. When a match is made, the tiles in the match are removed from the grid and the entire grid shifts in the direction you moved to make the match. New tiles are then added to the grid.\r\n          </p>\n<em>The main game screen.</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nRules\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          You start the game with a maximum five segments of <strong>Energy</strong>. Each time you make a <strong>Move</strong> that results in a <strong>Match</strong>, you'll gain half of a segment of <strong>Energy</strong>. You'll lose half a segment of <strong>Energy</strong> if your <strong>Move</strong> does not result in a <strong>Match</strong>.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n<strong>When you run out of Energy, the game will end!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>The screen you'll see when the game has ended.</em><br/>\n<p>\r\n          Each successive <strong>Match</strong> increases your <strong>Streak</strong> count by one. Each tile is worth one point, multiplied by your <strong>Streak</strong>. The higher your <strong>Streak</strong>, the more points you'll get! If you make a <strong>Move</strong> that doesn't result in a <strong>Match</strong>, your <strong>Streak</strong> will be reset to one - but you'll collect bonus points worth the <strong>Streak</strong> multiplied by ten when it does!\r\n          </p>\n<em>Making a match.</em>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Auto-matches</strong> (matches made when the grid adds new tiles, or after they shift) do not generate <strong>Energy</strong>, but they do increase your <strong>Streak</strong>. Try to make matches in a direction that will result in an <strong>Auto-match</strong> to maximize your points!\r\n          </p>\n<em>Creating an auto-match.</em>\n<p>\r\n          Making a <strong>Match</strong> of more than four tiles - for example, two <strong>Rows</strong> or two <strong>Columns</strong>, or intersecting <strong>Rows</strong> and <strong>Columns</strong> - will refill your <strong>Energy</strong> bar.\r\n          </p>\n<em>A double match.</em>\n\n<p>\r\n          To maintain a <strong>Streak</strong>, you can use the <strong>Crank</strong> to shift tile colors through a <strong>Row</strong> or <strong>Column</strong>. Colors will wrap around in both directions. This costs an entire segment of <strong>Energy</strong>, so be careful! You may not use the <strong>Crank</strong> if you have one segment or less of <strong>Energy</strong> remaining.\r\n          </p>\n<em>Using the crank to move colors to make a match.</em>\n\n<p>\r\n          When you're down to half a segment of <strong>Energy</strong>, you have the option of giving your Playdate a hearty <strong>Shake</strong> if no matches are within reach. The grid will clear, and when the new tiles appear and any of them <strong>Auto-match</strong>, your <strong>Energy</strong> will be refilled. If nothing matches, the game ends.\r\n        </p>\r\n      \r\nControls\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n           Moves the <strong>Row</strong> and <strong>Column</strong> selector. <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> select rows, and <strong>Left</strong> and <strong>Right</strong> selects columns.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n           Shifts a <strong>Column</strong> down and a <strong>Row</strong> right.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n           Shifts a <strong>Column</strong> up and a <strong>Row</strong> left.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n           A clockwise 90\u02da turn will shift tile colors in a <strong>Row</strong> to the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Column</strong> tile colors <strong>Down</strong>. A counter-clockwise 90\u02da turn will shift tile colors in a <strong>Row </strong> to the <strong>Left</strong> and <strong>Column</strong> tile colors <strong>Up</strong>.\r\n        </p>\r\n      \r\nMiscellaneous\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          You can restart a game from the <strong>System Menu</strong>.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n          You can also enable <strong>Dark Mode</strong> from the <strong>System Menu</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n          The top five local <strong>High Scores</strong> are displayed on the <strong>Main Game Menu</strong>, <strong>Game Over Screen</strong> and when the game is paused.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n          If you have a game already in progress, you can continue by pressing the <strong>A</strong> button on the Main Game Menu, or start a new game with the <strong>B</strong> button.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>The main menu screen.<br/></em><br/>\n<em>The pause menu.<br/></em><br/>\n<em>The game in dark mode.</em>\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install the Game\r\n<p>\r\nNot sure how to sideload games onto your Playdate?
