You can freely travel between different locations, read theories about Submachine and observe how things work inside this network. There are locations that you might recognize from previous games, there&#39;s a lot of new yet undiscovered content, there are even locations that you think you know, but they&#39;re somehow different. Surely worth a look. The best part - it&#39;s an open project, which means I can add more locations later on and it will all work together smoothly. So, tinfoil hats on and start exploring if you dare, because there are some dark places inside.<br />\n[meanwhile, seven years later...]<br />\nIn January of 2017 this project stopped being &quot;free online&quot; and morphed into &quot;free downloadable&quot;, and here we are.<br />\nPlease keep the file structure exactly as it is after unpacking. The main game file (subnet.exe / subnet.app / subnet.swf) needs the &quot;sub_loc&quot; folder along side it in order to work properly. Otherwise you&#39;ll just get a black screen after hitting the play button as the game won&#39;t be able to load any location (&quot;sub_loc&quot; folders contains all locations of this project).<br />\nIf you downloaded a new version and want to use your save file from previous version, you have to keep the game in the exact same folder on your hard drive as the previous one. I know, it&#39;s kind of strange, but hey, there&#39;s flash for you.<br />\nFor this new,\u00a0December 2017 update:\u00a0I STRONGLY suggest starting a new game, since there are extensive changes to animations all over the place, which might mess up your previous save (some doors can be half-opened and inaccesible).<br />\nIf you feel like it, maybe consider supporting it on Patreon.<br />\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mateus...<br />\nPlease also notice that this is work in progress.<br />\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s unfinished, bugged, or pre-alpha. On the contrary.<br />\nIt only means that it&#39;s expandable, and new content is being added regularly since June of 2010.<br />\nThat means new locations, new puzzles, new storylines might appear in the future.<br />\nCheck back from time to time to see if there&#39;s perhaps new version of this Universe for you to discover.<br />\nSubmachine Universe is a companion exploration project tied to the Submachine series of point and click games.<br />\nhttp://www.mateuszskutnik.com/..<br />\n[IMPORTANT]<br />\nBefore comment: please make sure you don&#39;t spoil any locations to other players. Don&#39;t post location numbers, ok?
