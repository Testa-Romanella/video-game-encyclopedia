Your fields can be cultivated with machines from CLAAS and even your animals have to be taken care of. <br/>The complete Agricultural Simulator allows you to ride many genuine CLAAS tractors. Choose between many different models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm bigger areas. As striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to maximize the crop. Don\u2019t kick over the traces or you won\u2019t be able to upgrade your farm and buy more land.
