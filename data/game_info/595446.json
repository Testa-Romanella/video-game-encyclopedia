Unfortunately, you arrived too late - it's already armed, and about to drop. Decode \"passwords\" and hit a target score to stop it momentarily. Beat a set number of rounds to blow it up fully! If you take too long, the bomb will fall deeper to the planet's core. </p>\n<p>Watch the timer to the side for your countdown, and try to solve the scrambles for words anywhere four to eight letters long. Of course, if you figure out an eight letter word, that's the highest score!</p>\n<p>You can play in two ways currently - with the mouse, or by directly typing on the keyboard. Typing is faster, but both are possible. Clicking on the game should focus the keyboard on it.</p>\n<p>The dictionary that WordGeddon uses is in English, with just over 12,500 eight-letter words alone. It's quite possible that some may be unfamiliar, but if so - don't worry. Just try to solve for a smaller word inside it! WordGeddon has a total dictionary of 41699 words!</p>\n<p>Note: At the moment, the full core game loop is running! However, everything else is still on a to-do list, including some polish... and audio. There will be\u00a0updated later versions but this one is being left as-is!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd7706c9a9c483ddcd94c035c435df5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DevMerlin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
