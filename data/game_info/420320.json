This is a silly game based a little bit around my own experiences, but mostly it's about being in your early twenties and your best friend wanting to go join the circus. Make a new friend, if you can, or maybe just try and have a great night with your bestie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two secret endings, both silly and fun, but giving a little lore on the characters. I hope you enjoy this game and perhaps I'll make a sequel, if people like it. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7f3c495495c2b9e5aa1e8fbe816c93a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lovesickcircus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
