Or you can directly use the <strong>touch input</strong> on the display. Just swipe up or down on your side.\r\n </p>\n<p>Do you like fast rallies and excitement. Then the <em>ACTION</em> mode is right for you. If you prefer a more deliberate and calm approach, then choose the <em>STRATEGY</em> mode.\r\n </p>\n<p>Looking for the ultimate challenge? Then play with the <em>BUMPER</em>, which literally gives the ball a new direction - no one can be sure if you choose <em>RANDOM</em> mode. The ball gets faster and faster - how responsive are you? If you want a break press <strong>[ESC]</strong> or <strong>[P]</strong>.\r\n </p>\n<p>Customize your game: determine the size and speed of the paddles, set the points you need to win.\r\n </p>\n<p>But the most important thing remains: Hit the ball with the right part of the paddle - so that it becomes unreachable for your opponent. This is how you master <strong>ULTRAPONG</strong>!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc5ff232e26b41d4e8b5d91eefda735d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DragorGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
