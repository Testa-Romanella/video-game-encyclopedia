{"id": 967327, "slug": "ioo", "name": "IOO", "name_original": "IOO", "description": "A minimalist pixel-art single-player game focused on the exploration of a procedurally generated world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTry to finish the goal of surviving 100 days in this unknown world while you gather rare resources from any of its 30 biomes. Fight against the wildlife, find isolated villages where you can trade for medicines and supplies and help IOO live outside the gold mines for as long as she can.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a game designed to be enjoyed at your own pace. You can save your progress daily by going to sleep so you can take a rest and resume later and you can also decide how many in-game days you want to play at once. Enjoy the pixel-art biomes, the wildlife sounds and background music but be aware of your supplies and health if you want to make the long run, and always keep an eye on your surrondings to find each biome's rare resources and avoid getting a surprise attack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you really make it to 100 days? Get the game and find out!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T03:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/9449ba503955398b28a8bcf3f713716d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Fisch"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio Fisch"], "esrb_rating": null}
