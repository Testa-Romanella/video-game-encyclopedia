Player criticism encourages me to continue. I have not been so lucky with the judges. But we make games for the players after all.\r\n<p>Feedback  IFComp<br/></p>\r\nBrilliant setting. Engaging. Funny\r\nLoved having to listen to left or right to figure out where the monster was- that was a cool mechanic!\r\nOk, so this game is a fresh one butI dont like to fight and die in a choice based novel. Sound effects are good and efficient to create an inmersive history.\r\nDear Oscar, Thank you for your game \u2018At Night\u2019 which I enjoyed playing. The sounds were very well integrated into the game and the breathing was particularly creepy. I hope you\u2019ll return to a future competition with a longer game. Best of luck with your next IF project!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e26d036a086c20292aed81dfa806ff06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oscar Martinez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
