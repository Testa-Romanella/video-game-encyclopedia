A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat\u2026 aggressive.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><br/> <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T13:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec61c59635f68781424429d6480b7f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eko Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Nacon"], "esrb_rating": null}
