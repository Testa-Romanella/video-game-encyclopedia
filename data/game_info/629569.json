You need to connect all pieces to create a seamless road. It's quite simple but anyway you need to FIX the road and FIND the way how to move pieces correctly.</p>\n<p>Click on road pieces with Left or Right Mouse Buttons to rotate them.<br/></p>\n<p>Look out - some pieces are rotated by others!</p>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy this little prototype.
