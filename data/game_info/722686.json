But though madmen and tyrants fall to his blade, never will he claim that his battle is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the tsurugi he wields is cursed Muramasa, which five centuries ago brought ruin to the land, and innocent blood is the price it demands in exchange for its terrible might.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Where there are demons, I slay them. Where there are saints, I slay them.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThese words are an oath, the unbreakable Law binding him to his armor.
