We are 17 yo\u00a0students from Warsaw. And this is our first Game Jam and first fully and succesfully completed game. I hope every next game would be better and you guys would enjoy it :)<br/></p>\n<p>Theme for the jam was:\u00a0<strong>Stronger together</strong>, so our first idea was ,,Portal\" like game, with small child and his dog. He could control dog to solve puzzles etc. but the game was too ambitious and too hard to make for us in a week, so we started searching for another idea. When I was in the church i got that idea. How it\u00a0 connects to the jam theme? People in bunker have to work together to survive longer. For ex. cook can make food, but when attacked by bandits he needs a soldier to defend.</p>\n<p>I know this game is not perfect (like my English :)), but i really like it, and learnt a lot while doing it, same as my graphic designer Wiktor. This is my first game with Unity Event Systems and Wiktor's first font ever made. So i hope you will enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/6817aeb245e69ca0ff12dcfb1cbc68f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DonPierogov"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
