Lucky wants to avoid this so they can stay up at night reading their new book! Help Lucky collect sticks to stoke the fire, peas to sate their hunger, and water to moisturize their skin. If Lucky goes into hibernation they won't be able to finish their book until they wake up!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Collect resources and bring them back to the book. Keep an eye on the weather (top right), it affects the rate your resources drop (bars on the bottom). You take a break collecting resources at night to read, watch the day/night timer in the bottom right. Try to delay hibernation as long as possible to read more pages.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Windy Weather: Dehydrates you faster (need more water)\r\n</li><li>Cold Weather: Lowers your temperature faster (need more sticks)\r\n</li><li>Hot Weather: Increases your metabolism (need more food)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys\r\n</li><li>Jump/Skip Reading: W or Up Arrow or Space bar</li><li>Fast Fall: S or Down Arrow</li><li>Reset to start of first day: R</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:<br/>TheBookSnail - Code/Art/SFX<br/>Erica - Concept Design<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 days for Ludum Dare 50.
