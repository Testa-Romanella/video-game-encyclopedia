Plus an animal companion of your choice.</p>\n<p>- tactical combat with different weather and status effects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- no random encounters. You can see enemies and (try to) avoid them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- the option to skip battles! Though this is really not recommended you can skip battles completely if you just want to explore the world. This includes boss battles.</p>\n<p>- three boards where you can play \"Roll'n'Rumble\" if you want to take a break from battling.</p>\n<p>- alternatively if you want to battle more face the Ancient Caves, 40 levels of dungeons filled with random loot and enemies. You do start without equipment and at level one, though better save before you enter!</p>\n<p>- potion crafting. Gather plants and parts of monsters to create a variety of potions.</p>\n<p>- a fast pace. Even though there's quite a lot to do a single playthrough should take 15 hours at most. But with different routes and different decisions to take you may want to play through it more than once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T01:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b15ef16739151b0587800b2b3dd42c4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calumnius"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
