If you're able to make a crash landing on the soft rainbows, a treat awaits you!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This was my first ever game jam, and though I had a lot of issues in actually making something for it, it was fun! I had originally planned to make it using Godot, however after getting started and making a lot of headway in the project, Godot crashed, completely and utterly, so much so that i couldn't even open godot back up to check if the game was saved, as it immediately crashed upon launching Godot. With that having taken up most of my time, I ended up switching over to the only other game software I had any sort of experience with, Pico 8. I made the entire game pretty quickly, reusing ideas for an old game i had made, and since I knew well enough how that one worked, I was able to make this passable game pretty quick. It's kinda bad, but it's my second game i've ever made, so i'm pretty happy i at least finished it.</p>\n<p>The limitation was easy, considering that pico 8 practically only uses 8x8 graphics. As for the theme, i'd already been planning something in space, and what else does anyone think of when considering cats in space, but nyan cat! So, that's essentially the entire reasoning for nyan cat :P.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b65ad13030666f522c03c4e9127d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theElementalF0rce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
