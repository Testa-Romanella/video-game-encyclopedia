Each day, the player will assign their tribe members to tasks such as scavenging, crafting items, hunting and foraging, or defending the camp. As your tribe members gain experience from accomplishing tasks, they will level up. It will be up to the player to build their tribe members into competent fighters, craftsmen, hunters and scouts if they are to survive this dangerous world. Speaking of danger, your characters will have to survive against the many threats of the current world, such as horrifying wildlife, hostile opposing tribes and bandits, as well as natural events such as dust storms and the cold. Every location and event in the world is procedurally generated, causing a different playing experience on every single playthrough.</p>\n<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PostNomad </strong>takes place hundreds of years after an apocalyptic event wiped out the majority of mankind. Humans have lost knowledge of the old world, and your tribe is just one of many trying to survive. You have no concept of rebuilding humanity, you only want to bring your tribe through to the next day. However, those who came before you passed down the legend of a promised land far to the east, where crops are able to grow on a large scale. As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to this promised land to secure your continued existence. Will you survive the journey?
