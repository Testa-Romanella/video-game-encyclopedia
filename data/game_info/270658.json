{"id": 270658, "slug": "eurobi-racing", "name": "Eurobi Racing", "name_original": "Eurobi Racing", "description": "Eurobi Racing is a simplistic \"run\" type game where you aim to get as far as you can. The game gets increasingly difficult as time passes, and puts your reactions to the ultimate test. Once unlocked, upgrades will greatly help in getting you farther than ever before, and will make the later levels of the game a little easier (on your soul).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n     Look forward to additions, including but not limited to: Coop and Versus modes, full soundtrack, new power-ups and mechanics, several new playable vehicles and maps, and (hopefully) a mobile version using touch controls. I will also be working closely with community input and suggestions to make this first game of mine not only<br/>\r\nsomething I can be proud of, but something players can see grow and change based on their own feedback. I'm also excited to admit I have multiple other projects currently in progress. I plan to continue working on them after I can officially take this out of early access, so be sure to look forward to those as well...
