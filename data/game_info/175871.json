At first, I really hated my game, but in the past weeks, I'd started actually liking it. I felt like the name \"Self Esteem Simulator\" got my point across well, I liked my progress bar idea, I made a start and end screen, everything was great. Then, however, the actual making of the progress bar took literally hours longer than I expected it to, and I didn't leave enough time for last minute troubleshooting. As of the time I write this, I can't get my \"done\" button to work, and my progress bar is wonky. Let it be known that both of these things are very simple to fix - I'm chalking at least some of it up to my computer being really fussy lately. Anyway, I don't think I'm going to stop working on this project for a while, but after it's turned in, I'm definitely gonna take a break to think more about what I want out of this game.</p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>All the concrete bugs have been fixed, which is awesome!  I still didn't get to do everything I wanted, like re-do my pixellated tools (lipstick, blush brush), but I'm still pretty satisfied.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf28063590f2eb0afadabf8b86084ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cat_efalls"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
