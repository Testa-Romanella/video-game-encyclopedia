R1 to accelerate, L2 to brake. When you can see a \u201chijack\u201d indicator on an opponent, press the hijack button (triangle/Y) once to start a jump, and again at the right time (when the red ring reaches the circle in the centre) to land it. If you miss the timing you fall and lose. Also, if a foe hijacks you (should only happen with other players) you will get a chance to get them back by \u201clanding\u201d again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Keyboard alternates: space to accelerate, Z to hijack. )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a11381dbb07ffd3f21c8fae5089e7826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jason RT Bond"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
