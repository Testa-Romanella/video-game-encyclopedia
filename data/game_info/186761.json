Big ones, small ones, ones that climb on fences, All the Cats! Explore and solve some mild puzzles in a simple minimalistic world.<br/></p>\r\nGame Description\r\n<p>This game was made using the Bitsy game engine which is a very simple and easy to use tool for creating simple and small games, allowing you to focus on just a few core ideas and designs. <br/></p>\n<p>The CONTROLS are only the Arrow Keys, or, alternatively, WASD on your keyboard.  <br/></p>\n<p>You move your Avatar/Character using those controls, and you can interact with objects by walking into them.</p>\r\nAfterword\r\n<p>Sorry if there are any bugs! Feel free to point any out. I may get around to fixing any that pop up as well as possibly adding some more Cats and Rooms if I find the time.</p>\n<p>Alright then, have fun people!</p>\n<p>~Ripple</p>\n\r\nSpecial Mentions\r\n<p>Bitsy Game Engine by Adam Ledoux: Thank you for creating such an awesome and easy to use tool!!
