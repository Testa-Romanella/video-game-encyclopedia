This time, they've shifted their running route across the tortoise nesting ground, despite protests.</p>\n<p>Help the tortoises band together in solidarity and create a blockade to prevent the hares from stomping on precious tortoise eggs. Stack up on top of each other to prevent the hares from leaping over.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for #StaySafeJam. Theme: Solidarity. Screenshots, video, and instructions coming soon.<br/></p>\n<p>There are only 3 levels so far.

If you finish building before the time is elapsed, then press the 5 key to speed up time.</li><li>Tortoises can be in one of two states: mobilized or fortified. Toggle mode by clicking or dragging the mouse across them.</li><li>Mobilized tortoises will move based on your WASD or Arrow keys.</li><li>Fortified tortoises stay put to the best of their ability, even if they are stacked on top of another tortoise. They are harder for hares to knock over / push.</li><li>Aim a mobilized tortoise at a closeby tortoise of the same size or larger to allow stacking (you'll see a blue dotted line connecting the tortoises if it is stackable). Press space to stack. You can't stack on top of a smaller tortoise.</li><li>Tortoise eggs are extremely fragile. Even the lightest touch from a tortoise or a hare will destroy the egg. If you lose all of your eggs, then you lose the level. Do not step on the eggs with your tortoises.</li><li>Survive the hare onslaught for a set amount of time without losing all of your eggs to complete the level.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity, Blender, Audacity.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> Rite of Passage by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com).
