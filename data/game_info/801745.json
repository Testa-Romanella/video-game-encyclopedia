Also, there is no death and instant  return to the last checkpoint. Instead, mistakes can lead to falling back  down to certain points on the map. So there's a real consequence to your  actions. But I might be the tiniest bit of evil there as well... :) <br/></p><p>I plan to build in an extra mode, where you can return to your last standing point.</p><p>Have Fun.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T08:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d108002cf41a02f0178684c44fd42c48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lenzer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
