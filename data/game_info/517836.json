Except this time you don't need a pencil, paper or a D6. And it is a little harder to cheat by keeping your fingers in the previous pages.</p>\n<p>The setting and style of the adventure is very reminiscent of classic British sci-fi TV shows of the 70s and 80s. It is a bit spooky, but not graphic. There are literally no graphics anyway.</p>\n<p>Have fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T04:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e74fe01b7f54a5b2ef106393f296125b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChocolateOcelot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
