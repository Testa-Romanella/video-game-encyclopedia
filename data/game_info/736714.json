As well as the awesome community that's built up in that twelve months.</p>\n<p>The actual date was a fortnight ago, but I\u00a0started this game a day or two before and didn't get it done in time. Planned to finish it by the next episode a week late. But nope haha. Have added to it a bunch in those times I didn't quite hit me deadline so it's probably better for it.</p>\n<p>Iv'e tested through this a handful of times but there's may be the odd bug or spelling mistake due to me usually working on this late at night or early in the mornin'. Will update the game if problems are found aaand if I\u00a0need to add anything.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0may play around with the visuals for the background more, mainly with the portrait images during most of the game. They're a bit...jumbled/blurry/something and I played around a lot with making 'em clearer with contrasting and outlines etc. but it's hard to have things be both clear and within the tile limit to have dialogue added too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I ended up going back a few steps after that and ended up with stuff that ain't too clear with facial features and such, but has a kind of Feel\u00a0The Magic/Rub Rabbits look to it that's grown on me and I really like haha. So a lot of that might stay the same.</p>\n<p>Buuuut yus; hope y'all enjoy this 'game' (kinda more of an animation with gameplay bits\u00a0than anything haha) and I look forward to celebrating the twenty four month milestone next haha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much love y'all and keep on keeping on, nothin' but a good thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac1f02dc418109528aa581ae643ef20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["GameBuoyGames - Michael Towns"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
