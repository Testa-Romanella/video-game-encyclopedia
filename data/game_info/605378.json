Its a 1 month GameJam like project I did for myself to learn Unity. The idea came after a friend of mine talked about a game where you rotate a stick and he couldn't find it so I decided to make my own prototype and here it is!</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave comments, im glad for constructive criticism but if you like what you see you can also tell me in the comments :)</p>\n\n<p>Im thinking of maybe adding some more Levels but the time limit I set to myself is 1 month so I probably won't update much to the game. If you find bugs you can report them to me and I will look into fixing them.</p>\n\n<p>In the tutorial it shows you gifs how the game is played, but sadly those aren't showing up in the web version so either you download the app or ignore the white canvases. If some knows why they aren't displaying feel free to contact me! :)</p>\n\n<p>PS.: The Highscore feature probably only works local so feel free to share your Highscore screenshot to compare your time with others!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T09:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/338fce1597a5534d0dfe56ed4206ba8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["B0bby4k"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
