Will I like this?</strong><br/>Yes! We've taken all the great bits that our fans loved about the original, smoothed out the rough edges, and expanded on it. While we've added some extra complexity around combat and orders, we've also made the systems quick and easy to use, and included a smart set of defaults if you just want to go with the flow.<br/><br/><strong>What are some of the new gameplay features?</strong><br/>You have more control over how your survivors breach and investigate locations. You can also equip your survivors with a weapon that they will always use.<br/><br/>Some orders have more granular options - if you notice zombies massing to the north, then you can focus your barricading efforts on north-facing entrances.<br/><br/>We've also overhauled many parts of the interface so it's easy to see what's going on. The most obvious example is the location layout, but you can also easily check your survivors' skills, injuries and special modifiers.<br/><br/><strong>Are survivor relationships important?</strong><br/>Absolutely. We've refined the system so you can have more ways to change relationships. In addition to the rumour system, we\u2019ve added a new option: redemptions. <br/><br/>This involves one survivor being asked to do certain tasks to 'redeem' themselves in the eyes of another, which removes a prejudice. It's also more obvious what might happen to relationships during a dilemma, so you can tactically choose an option that improves relationships.<br/><br/><strong>Is combat still brutal?</strong><br/>Combat is still the most dangerous aspect of the game, but you have more control over breaching. For example, you can equip survivors and select how cautious they should be while breaching. Furthermore, survivors are more likely to flee if things are looking pretty grim. If you still find it hard, then you can tweak the difficulty settings.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c76ee45951b1a4ed42bd8646ce3cc2fe.jpg", "website": "https://www.zafehouse2.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Screwfly Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Screwfly Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
