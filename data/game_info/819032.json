The platforms on which the player jumps are randomly generated only just before the player reaches them, thus placing him in pressuring situations which require quick thinking and reactions. The purpose of the game is to help ZO stay alive for as long as possible and therefore achieve the highest score you can, while at the mercy of RNG.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>A/D or arrows to move horizontally</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>Esc to pause<br/></p><p><strong>Game made by</strong></p><p>https://itch.io/profile/eternitarian</p><p>https://bluegalaxy4012.itch.io/</p><p>https://itch.io/profile/dummage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac7/ac7c340d57419497af2b9d03e036788a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["azert9526"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
