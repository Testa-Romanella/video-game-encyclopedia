When the beat ring reaches you (and turns teal), you can shoot perfect notes dealing lots of damage! Shooting off the beat will only shoot out pitiful rests.\u00a0 Fighting to the beat will give you a combo so you can rack-up points!</p>\n<p>NOTES/DEVLOG:</p>\n<p>This game is a WIP and this demo build in no way reflects the finished product! Corners had to be cut in order to meet the deadline, updates will follow with a more stable build of the game with more intended features. Sorry for the inconsistent level design.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Art by @DefectiveDr0id</p>\n<p>Code by Steven Beller</p>\n<p>Music by Christopher Wood</p>\n<p>Help from\u00a0@blockops</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20bfe45f52c2e5c5566587ac4eea5cd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DefectiveDr0id", "Steven Beller", "CDWpod"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
