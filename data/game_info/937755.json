This testing version will always remain free to play as I add weapons and enemies, though donation functionality will come into effect later down the line for those who wish to support the project. This version of Paradyne, however it may change, will always remain free of charge.</p>\n<p>After this testing version of the project is complete development may begin on a paid, story-driven version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paradyne is a learning project. There will be errors and issues as I learn how to implement everything to a widely-accessible degree.\u00a0 Feel free to notify me of any bugs, or anything you feel could be better (within reason).<br/><br/>Thank you and welcome to Paradyne A.I.<br/></p>\n<p>We Test the Best.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>[W,A,S,D] Lateral Movement<br/>[Space] Jump<br/>[Left Ctrl] Toggle Crouch<br/>[Left Shift] Sprint (hold)<br/>[Rmb] Zoom (hold)<br/>[E] Interact<br/>[Esc / Enter] Pause Game<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Patch notes\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p>0.0.2<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Stopped walk noise while jumping</li><li>Updated HUD health indicator</li><li>Main Menu UI updates</li><li>Misc UI updates for resolution</li><li>Soundtrack volume fixes</li><li>SFX volume fixes</li><li>Fixed damage overlay not restarting</li><li>Added numeric health indicator</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6aa5b1da88caa52694563198a911ccd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AegisApplications"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
