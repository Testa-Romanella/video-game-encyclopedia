There is no solo, but you can play it alone to train all you want.</p>\n<p><strong>After weathering a passing asteroid, not-so-friendly astronauts have to go outside the space station to repair. It was then that their board computer announces that there is only food and oxygen left for one person. The astronauts will therefore settle the score to know who will survive.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left stick : Orientate the character<br/>A : Speed up<br/>B : Slow down<br/>RT : Fire (hold to burst fire)<br/>X : Reload<br/>Start : Go back to title<br/>D-Pad : Select options in main menu</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The controls are controller-only</strong>.<br/>You need an Xbox 360/One controller.
