{"id": 733094, "slug": "halope-demo", "name": "HalOPE [DEMO]", "name_original": "HalOPE [DEMO]", "description": "<p><strong><em>HalOPE</em></strong> is an exploration game with light puzzle elements, made in\u00a0<em><strong>RPGMaker VX Ace</strong>.</em> It mainly makes\u00a0use of the<strong> key items </strong>system. This\u00a0allows you to 'equip' items and use them on objects and NPCs- for hints, solutions, or maybe just some fun flavor text.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as an angel who has woken up in a mysterious white space, with an unexplained hole in their chest. Your goal isn't entirely clear, but all you can do is continue on. A series of small and colorful worlds will help guide you on your way. Currently, the story rests in an incomplete state, but perhaps something is lurking just outside the next door... So to speak, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>The demo covers the first two 'chapters' of the game. This should be about half of the full experience. The demo will not be being updated with new content, but it may receive the occasional\u00a0 patch here and there!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>an item system that allows for unique interactions with NPCs, attempting to add a bit of spice to the \u2018fetch quest\u2019 formula</li><li>two full areas to explore, each based off of specific themes</li><li>around 1-2 hours of gameplay</li><li>original pixel art and music by myself. is that a plus? maybe!!</li><li>just a pinch of esotericism! the game has quite a few secrets to find! or ignore entirely, if that\u2019s more your style...</li><li>a lot of symbolic storytelling with a few spooky elements-- make of it what you will!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>0.5 -\u00a0</strong>The initial demo release!<br/><strong>Current version: 0.5.1\u00a0</strong><strong>-</strong> includes a small bug fix.</p>\n\r\nContent warnings\r\n<p>This game covers quite a few sensitive topics, which you may want to be aware of before playing.
