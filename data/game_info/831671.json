Just tap the direction of the lane you want to switch to and you'll be moved there automatically.<br/></p>\n<p>* If your fingers are fast enough, it is possible to stay in the space between lanes for a short while. That will help you avoid seemingly impossible obstacles:</p>\n\n<p>* You can often squeeze through very tight gaps. Take note of the size of the character's hitboxes:</p>\n\n\n<p>* In the first stages of the game, a heart spawns whenever you get 1000 points. Don't forget to collect these extra lives, as their spawn rate decreases in the later stages.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I made this game by myself during July 2022. The game was completely made in Pico-8, a fantasy console that's limited by design. You can learn more about it here: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to grab the Pico-8 cartridge for this game, you can do so from my profile on the Pico-8 BBS: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=45642&amp;mode=carts\u2282=2#m<br/></p>\n<p>What inspired me was Krystman's (https://krystman.itch.io/) Pico-8 Shmup tutorials on the Lazy Devs YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs), especially when he demonstrated how to create a parallax scrolling star field. You can see that I implemented that sort of thing with the bubbles in this game. I ended up not making a Shmup, though, but I think I'll try it out someday in the future.</p>\n<p>The main song of the game is a rendition of Misirlou, a folk song from Eastern Mediterranean countries. I wanted it to sound more like Dick Dale's arrangement of it, which is quintessentially surf rock, but I don't think I've succeeded in capturing that impression. The song is still catchy, though, but some people may feel like it doesn't really fit a marine setting.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing! I made this game for the fun of it, but consider making a donation if you enjoyed this little toy I've put together for you.<br/></p>\n\r\nLicense\r\n<p>This game is released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
