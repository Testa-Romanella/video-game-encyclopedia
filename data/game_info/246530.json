This game can be played locally with a shared screen, over the internet, or any combination of the two with up to seven friends (8 players total). For the best experience, plug in an Xbox controller. If you don't have one, the game will revert to keyboard controls.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has two modes. Play until all players have been struck by a bike or until two minutes have elapsed. Players can tell the moving dragon in the sky when to drop berries or bikes. Catch the berries to get bigger and dodge the bikes. Players can move and jump to their hearts content, but they must use their rechargeable energy to make the dragon drop things. If a player is dodging all the bikes you drop, try blocking him off by standing in his way!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nJump, run, and eat your way to victory!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/91746f1b10749edbcb1ff71ee7d9d61d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2 Barrel Arts"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2 Barrel Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
