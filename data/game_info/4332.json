{"id": 4332, "slug": "spec-ops-the-line", "name": "Spec Ops: The Line", "name_original": "Spec Ops: The Line", "description": "<p>The Line is the tenth entry into the Spec Ops series, as well as a modernized reboot. Following the worst recorded sandstorms in Dubai, Captain Martin Walker was sent to investigate the events that took place in the city, after it was cut off from all transport and communication. So now the squad of the elite soldiers has to discover, what was meant by the last message they received from the dense wall of raging sand.<br />\nSpec Ops: The Line places the attention on the squad mechanics, where players can give orders to the NPCs, accompanying the player during the game. Aside from the single-player story campaign, players can join the multiplayer matches, which may vary from the solo/team deathmatch to \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d type matches. Cooperative missions for two players have been added shortly after the game release. The single player campaign allows players to experiment with the weapons, carrying two at a time and use the environments to their advantage, using hazardous sandstorm to clear-out the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2012-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b49/b4912b5dbfc7ed8927b65f05b8507f6c.jpg", "website": "http://www.specopstheline.com/", "rating": 4.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 495, "owned": 7046, "beaten": 1831, "toplay": 187, "dropped": 333, "playing": 38}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 151, "ratings_count": 1875, "suggestions_count": 532, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 1896, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Yager"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Missing Link Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
