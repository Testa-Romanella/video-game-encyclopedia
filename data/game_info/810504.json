Will you have a sarcastic or teasing relationship? Playful and flirty? Or down-to-earth and chill? You decide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, nothing you will choose will give you a bad ending. So there is no need to feel like you have to make a choice purely to be in the good graces of the love interest of your choosing, like many other romance games.</p>\n<p>There will be four routes in total \u2013 one for each love interest and the last being a polyamorous route. In this game, you can romance two males and one female.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Reader Gamer</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free-to-play with the option of donations &amp; with future NSFW DLC (which will cost $3.99) where the time will set a year after the characters graduate high school</p>\n<p><strong>Release Frame:</strong> When the timing is right</p>\n<p><strong>Rating:</strong>\u00a0Teen (Base Game), Mature (DLC)</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows and Android</p>\r\nGAME INFO/FEATURES:\r\n<ul><li>The game will take place over an in-game month.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The branching paths will be selected when choosing a partner for a school project.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>On the weekends, you can choose to go on dates with varying options/locations filled with fun and sweet moments.
