You have to get creative if you want to wake this Santa up - he is a very heavy sleeper and keeps taking naps!<br/></p>\n<p>Use brains and the element of surprise to solve the puzzles and wake Lazy Santa up in 4 unique levels so he can deliver his presents on Christmas Eve.</p>\n<p>The game works on both PC and mobile!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the ARROW KEYS, or the on-screen arrow buttons if you're on mobile, to move, climb and jump.</p>\n<p>Click / tap to interact with nearby objects.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>I made <em>\"Lazy Santa\"</em> in 48 hours for Yogscast Game Jam 2020 as a solo developer. All the gameplay, art and music was made by me during the 48 hour time limit. I used Construct 3 to make the game, Photoshop to make all graphics and art, and LMMS to make the music. The sound effects are taken from various royalty-free sources.</p><p>The jam theme was \"Surprise\". My idea is that Santa is so lazy that he can only be woken up by being \"surprised\". I also achieved the \"Brunch Club\" modifier by including some throwable food in the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5f5c84932ab472408ba76ea7d177a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheoClarke"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
