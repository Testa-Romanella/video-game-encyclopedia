Roll around you (with WASD or the arrow keys), jump (with Space) and choose a good place to take root (with Enter).</p>\n<p>While you are a tree you can plant the seeds in your inventory by clicking on the terrain. Right clicking removes the plants you created, and the Delete key removes the first seed from your inventory (at the top of the list).</p>\n<p>You can then turn into a seed again by pressing Enter, and you'll see that when going through vegetation you collect new seeds.</p>\n<p>The terrain is shared with other players so feel free to collaborate and create beautiful vistas !</p>\n<p>(If needed mute/unmute the game by pressing the M key)</p>\n<p>Made by David \"Kyrmaal\" Zennaro for the Global Game Jam 2023 (theme : Roots)<br/>Built using Unity 2021.1.3f1 &amp; Coherence SDK 0.10.8</p>\n<p>External assets used :<br/><br/>Toon Fantasy Nature by SICS Games for models, textures &amp; vegetation shader (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/toon-fantasy-nature-215197)<br/><br/>Morris Roman font by Dieter Steffmann (https://www.dafont.com/fr/morris-roman.font)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T20:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fade79c6359854af54c732bea8a76ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyrmaal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
