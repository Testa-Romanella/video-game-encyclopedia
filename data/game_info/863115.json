The longer you survive the higher you score.\r\n</li><li>The game will pause every 10 seconds to allow you to sell towers and modify the timeline. Toggle autoplay if you want it to keep looping over your current configuration.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Reactions:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Barricade = Earth + Steel = Stun for 1 tick</p>\n<p>Blind = Steel + Light = Slow\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Circulate = Air + Electricity = AOE electric damage\r\n</p>\n<p>Convection = Air + Fire = AOE fire damage\r\n</p>\n<p>Corrosion = Water + Steel = Damage over time\r\n</p>\n<p>Electrolysis = Water + Electricity = Damage over time\r\n</p>\n<p>Evaporate = Water + Fire = Increased damage on hit\r\n</p>\n<p>Gloom = Air + Dark = Slow\r\n</p>\n<p>Humidify = Air + Water = AOE water damage\r\n</p>\n<p>Judgment = Light + Dark = Increased damage on hit\r\n</p>\n<p>Melt = Fire + Steel = Increased damage on hit\r\n</p>\n<p>Overclock = Electricity + Steel = Deals large AOE on kill\r\n</p>\n<p>Poison = Earth + Dark = Damage over time\r\n</p>\n<p>Smite = Electricity + Light = Decreased enemy resistances\r\n</p>\n<p>Wealth = Earth + Fire = Increased gold on kill\r\n</p>\n<p>*Diffusion* = when there are too many elements that do not react with each other, they might diffuse and not react at all.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69fa929f2763b22747b0b6000fdd1ff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MightySmack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
