After they hear about a developing medical facility that pays for new patients, they swiftly drop her at the bottom of the driveway of HAVEN HOSPITAL and collect their check. </p>\n<p>\tThe doctors seem friendly at first, walking Janet through the halls showing their founder\u2019s portraits and telling the stories of how the hospital was formed. A group of scientists wanted to push the capabilities of the human body, especially those who have repressed anger and pain from a young age. In doing so, they discovered powers hidden within the human mind, but once those powers were activated, their minds collapsed. </p>\n<p>\tAfter discovering this, Janet attempted to escape but was caught and experimented on. By some miracle, she survived the activation and realized that she could outwit the doctors. Some doctors used the same strain of experiments that Janet was given, and gained powers for themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Team Members:</p>\n<p>Thomas Newsom: Producer, Sound Designer, Programmer</p>\n<p>Denis Besic: Programmer</p>\n<p>Colin Yoon: Background Artist</p>\n<p>Alec Reyes: Animator\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alex Illukin: Game Designer, Programmer</p>\n<p>Michael Barcroft: Garbage Programmer\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0afda1dcb55ea0b949375f390d9546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MichaelTheMotorCycle", "deni294", "Tom Newsome"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
