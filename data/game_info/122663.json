As you help the world around you to thrive, \r\nyou receive vital energy(Prana) in return. During the <strong>Autumn</strong> season, \r\nwhile the trees are shedding their leaves, orbs of Prana are released \r\ninto the air, which you can absorb. Your own Prana can be utilized to \r\nhelp and change the world around you and to obtain spiritual <strong>teachings</strong>.</p><p>More than levels, puzzles or in-game progressions, Autumn's focus is \r\non the growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the\r\n chair.</p><p>There are no time limits, no enemies to defeat, no goals to reach\u2026 \r\nexcept the ones you set for yourself. <strong>Relax, learn, grow</strong>\u2026 and enjoy \r\nAutumn.</p><p><strong>Now on STEAM!
