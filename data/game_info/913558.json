{"id": 913558, "slug": "deerhunter", "name": "Deerhunter", "name_original": "Deerhunter", "description": "<p>This is our first game jam entry, and also first game ever!\u00a0Thank you for playing.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE WHEN LOADING THE HTML5 VERSION. THE GAME IS LOADING WHEN SCREEN IS BLACK. After the jam is over, we will have an update that cleans up a lot of the bugs, and also polishes up the existing features. One thing is during the reload sequence, you have to click the text prompts rather than what the prompt is saying to click. The game ends when going to your truck, when the final\u00a0animation plays.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Fire</li><li>R - Reload</li><li>F - Interact<br/></li></ul><p>SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING:</p><p>The ending's still a little confusing in version 1.0 (Jam version). An animation hasn't been implemented in yet where the player is capture from behind when getting close enough to the truck. This then transitions to the ending scene where you are tied up in the cave (the animation for the cannibal in the cave still needs to be added, currently he's just t-posing over the player). One other thing to be added is the third deer shot will have the blue paint on the texture, slightly foreshadowing the player's demise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T07:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b56bcc6563c4b1b6cd1224bf7117dfcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jimbow"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
