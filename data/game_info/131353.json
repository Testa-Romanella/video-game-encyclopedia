I worked on this project on my own. Graphic and music assets were scrounged from the game environment itself and random places on the internet, but I designed the game play, wrote all of the dialogue, and scripted all of the events/programming logic that controls the flow of the game. There are three different sets of endings depending on how much of the game you complete. Average play-through takes just under 20 minutes. If you are a fan of this style of game, give it a go!<br/><br/><strong><em>spoilers </em></strong>- I have a full play-through here if you get stuck -</p><p> </p><p><strong>My Contact Info:</strong></p><p>email: mike@xosoftware.com</p><p>linked in: http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerjarsenault</p><p>facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mikerjarsenault</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a70e7812ea43de3a941ed9e79051051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XOSoftware"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
