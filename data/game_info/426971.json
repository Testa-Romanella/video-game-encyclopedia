Help Carrier and Fighter do their job of rebuilding bridges between islands and finally rebuild human relations to resolve any conflicts.</p>\n<p>How did we interpret the topic \"Reconstruction\"?</p>\n<p>Our game interprets the theme of game jam very literally with a slight touch of metaphor, because focuses not only on the construction of the bridge itself, but also on the reconstruction of human relations by the protagonists in the form of robots. In the game, the isolation of people has led to conflicts and the possible destruction of bridges, which makes the game interpretable in many ways.</p>\n<p>Game Jam Website:\u00a0https://zostanwdomurobgry.pl</p>\n<p>Bridgebot's Github Repository URL:\u00a0https://github.com/TheMatiaz0/Bridgebot</p>\n\n<p>The game was created by <strong>C</strong><strong>yberevolver_Studios</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>TheMatiaz0 (Mateusz Kusionowicz),</li><li>Biegus (Micha\u0142 Biegaj),</li><li>kurroneko (Rad Szwugier),</li><li>w4ty (Bruno T.).</li></ul>\n<p>#shooter\u00a0#retro\u00a0#roguelike\u00a0#action\u00a0#strategy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b03c13a8d35929f81de9be37b0cf5f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyberevolver_Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
