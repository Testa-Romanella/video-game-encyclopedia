Think of it as a prototype!\u00a0Hopefully one day, I'll come back to this and make it what I dreamed of it to be.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (4/17/2021):</strong> It has been brought to my attention that every ending leads to the \"bad\" ending... So please keep that in mind! Additionally, during Riley's locker room scene, their sprite sometimes doesn't show up. I can not guarantee a quick fix soon, but I\u00a0<em>will</em> restate that I do plan on remaking this game to the best of my abilities during this summer :) Plot points and dialogue will remain more or less the same.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd96620032b36aaf39ade640087b0611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aure-lia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
