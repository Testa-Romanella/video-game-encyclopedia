To reveal the message, you will have to scan the room and reveal hidden switches.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Augmented Reality does not like plain or blank walls and surfaces. Try to scan surfaces with pronounced textures and\u00a0features.</li><li>You know a surface is being scanned when it shows patterned dots or small white pluses (+).</li><li>Scan walls facing different directions.</li><li>If things seem off, like dots and pluses appearing inside walls, or green dust particles appearing very far off, or switches not revealing themselves, the scanning process probably got disoriented. Close the app (kill it) and restart.</li></ul>\n<p>This is a proof-of-concept showcasing the SLAM feature of Unity's AR Foundation (Google's ARCore in this case).</p>\n<p>The game utilizes the SDK's plane detection to find walls in the room. Using a still-not-very-optimal algorithm, it classifies these walls into clusters based on their facing directions. The game then uses this cluster data to place switches in different parts of the room (which changes every time you replay the game).</p>\n<p>The game also leverages ARCore's Light Estimation and Environment Probes features to add a touch of realism to the augmented objects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:56:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc1f70b1eee0345c9e0831eeef87fa04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Vanlal Hriata"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
