You can play up to 4 characters and\u00a0play as a brave adventurer, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the mansion's walls.</p>\n<p>There are some known issues like missing strafe keys, proper character customization, and some visual elements that are still temporary like UI elements.\u00a0 Also, the game lacks\u00a0detailed playtesting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you start the game, after character customization, there is a 3-page tutorial that sums up the controls and UI elements. Consider checking it before starting to play the game.\u00a0 Also, here is the control scheme:</p><p>W, A, S, D: Movement buttons.</p><p>1 &amp; 2: Attack buttons for left and right hand respectively. These are context-sensitive which means\u00a0if there is no enemy or an interactable area in the front, they do not work.</p><p>I: Opens the inventory screen. It supports the drag &amp; drop of items. You need to place the weapons into the character's hands to use them.</p><p>ESC: In-game menu</p><p>PS: Q &amp;\u00a0E buttons are for strafe but are not implemented at the moment, sorry.<br/></p><p>\u00a0That's all.\u00a0Thanks for checking out and\u00a0have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T12:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214bf958a9d8416b1154c91e77b9601d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolSkyre"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
