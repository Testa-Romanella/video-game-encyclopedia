Watch out not to lose to some timer randomly running out on the bottomest line :)<br/>- Different <strong>difficulties</strong>: easy, normal, medium and hard. Also there is the Zen mode, which will take off *everything*, even score, so you can just relax.<br/>- A <strong>shop</strong> full of different stuff! Customize your game experience with some hand-crafted themes (huge shoutout to SVGRepo for some) and make your life easier by getting some upgrades!<br/>- Some <strong>achievements</strong> to make the game more interesting (some of them are hidden \ud83d\udc40)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46b/46b8ec21cd5ee45868e595f475fc8dff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["altered"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
