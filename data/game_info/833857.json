He tells you he's got the studio set back up again and would love to discuss a new game\u00a0project with you. What could it be?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Bodhi 'n' Friends</em></strong> is a first-person indie horror game currently still in-development. This is a <strong>free demo</strong> version to give\u00a0you a taster of what to expect in the full game. Bodhi 'n' Friends is set across 7 days and <strong>2 of those days are playable\u00a0</strong><strong>in this demo</strong>. Do expect more content + changes in the full version of the game.</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\n<p>-Explore the game studio and find out what's going on. Find keys to unlock doors, notes that may give you lore or a code\u00a0to a safe, a game disc to play, etc.</p>\n<p>-Your phone will play an important part in Bodhi 'n' Friends - and no, not your phone in real life. Your phone contains the\u00a0<strong>Travel Utility App</strong>, which gives you ease of access to your phone's:</p>\n<ul><li>Flashlight</li><li>Battery</li><li>Time</li><li>Messages</li></ul>\n<p>-Throughout the game, you will receive messages from Peter and will need to respond sometimes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Your flashlight is very useful for navigating darker areas but can drain your phone's battery faster. You can find\u00a0light switches to turn on the lights in a room to avoid using your flashlight too much.</p>\n<p>-To charge your phone, there is a phone-charging port in the Main Room where you slot in your phone and it charges.</p>\n\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p><strong>[WASD] Movement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[LShift] Sprint</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[LCtrl] Crouch</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[E] Interact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Hold RMB] Zoom in</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[TAB] Toggle Phone</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[T] Check Last-Given Task</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Esc] Pause</strong></p>\n<p><em>*Other controls will be shown in-game.*</em></p>\r\nLANGUAGES:\r\n<p>This demo currently contains 2 languages and there <em>may</em>\u00a0be more languages in the full game:</p>\n<ul><li>English</li><li>Japanese (\u65e5\u672c)</li></ul>\n<p><em>If you notice any major translation mistakes for the Japanese translations, be sure to let me know and correct me if\u00a0</em><em>possible, that would be much appreciated.</em></p>\r\nEXTRA NOTES:\r\n<p>The menu &amp; trailer music are made just for Bodhi 'n' Friends, by <strong>Shan Soley</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T08:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8245344a3f37a6036e636ba91d09ab6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Shelton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
