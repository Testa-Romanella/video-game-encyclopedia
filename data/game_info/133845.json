Will you be able to SHAPESHIFT the beards &amp; moustaches of your clients and sustain yourself in the fashionable but harsh world of hipster chic? <br/><br/>Make it or break it in BARBER BLUES: living the dream! </p><p><strong>How to play: </strong><br/><br/>- select a customer sitting on the bench in your shop <br/>- memorise his requested hairdo <br/>- try to recreate his wishes as close as possible using your trusty razor (controlled by mouse, click to shave) <br/>- once you are finished, click the button labeled \"done\" and receive payment <br/></p><p>This is my 4th entry for Ludum Dare, and the 2nd time I've used the L\u00d6VE framework. I had lots of fun making this game over the weekend, I hope you have as much fun playing it. <br/><br/>Sadly I didn't have time to implement some variety in how the characters look. I wanted to add different skin tones and clothes, but I simply ran out of time. So please know that having them all the same was not my intention! <br/></p><p>The soundtrack for this game is available on my Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/martijnwf/sets/ld35-barber-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64caea371364e6f260d9d4a4bee84fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tijn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
