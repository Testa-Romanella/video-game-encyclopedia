If you liked it, please rate the game.</em></p>\n<p>LAILA is a puzzle platformer 2D game where you control Laila, a young girl with the power of controlling time on objects. But now, a mysterious corporation has captured our main protagonist and they want to use Laila's powers to rewind VHS tapes for money(Seriously, who does this?!). In this game you will solve all kinds of puzzles in this mysterious facility and maybe(just maybe) you can escape!</p>\n<p><em>There is actually a BUG when pressing both \"jump\" buttons(W and SPACEBAR), jumping with W\u00a0is a feature most of the playtester talked about it and I added at the last minute. So please, if possible, try to jump only pressing one of the buttons :D</em></p>\n<p><em>How to play:</em></p>\n<p>Please check the \"<strong><em>How To Play</em></strong>\" section in the <strong>MAIN MENU</strong> before playing</p>\n<p>You control Laila with \"<em><strong>WASD</strong></em>\" and \"<em><strong>SPACE</strong></em>\" and you can rewind objects by selecting them with \"<em><strong>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON</strong></em>\" and then holding \"<em><strong>RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON</strong></em>\". Every object with a blue outline can be selected(if it is close to you) and when you hold RMB every selected object will start to rewind. But remember, your \"<strong>MANA</strong>\" is finite so use it wisely.</p>\n<p>All the others commands are in the main menu, in the \"How to play\" section.</p>\n<p>Thank you for\u00a0playing and feel free to give a feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d688794d2e8cebdf77fc164e83ce8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["meganinja223"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
