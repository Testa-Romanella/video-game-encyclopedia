Instead of geometric shapes, the player matches the party members to perform attacks. Through talent choices each character can contribute to the battle in their own way. Choose from 4 specializations and make your own build by picking talents and itemization.<h3>World</h3>Going on an adventure to find a mighty artifact is a lot of fun but it is also a costly activity. Especially with Troll guarding every single bridge and demanding payment. The further you go, the more expensive it gets. Luckily, you can beat the gold out of the plenty treasure chests that are laying around. But beware, you are in a strange world and not all chests are just going to sit there and take the beating.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> 5 fantasy characters to match<br/></li><li> 3 powerful specializations to choose from<br/></li><li> 24 unique talents to change your play-style<br/></li><li> 30 levels with choices along the way<br/></li><li> 3 boss battles to overcome<br/></li><li> Hard mode to challenge yourself<br/></li><li> Achievements to collect<br/></li><li> Attributes and items to make your dream build</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c438d9089ba7bea0eaf0d47c666614b0.jpg", "website": "http://postpersonstudio.com/costly-adventure", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Postperson Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Postperson Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
