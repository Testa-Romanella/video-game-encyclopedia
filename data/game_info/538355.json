This equipment allows him to transfer his consciousness to other worlds in the form of an avatar, and to interact with its inhabitants. Unfortunately this technology is not without risk, and the machine has been corrupted by malicious pirates. Each trip they make allows them to take a little more control of the machine, and if they succeed, they could trap the explorer's consciousness in one of the worlds he visits. But our character is too eager for experience to worry about the risks and is determined to find out what those worlds have in store for him. Perhaps the experience gained during these journeys will allow him to avoid the pirates and regain control of his machine?\u00a0\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Setting up\r\n          <p>\r\n            Shuffle the deck of cards, then turn it over, so that the last card of the deck is face up, and note the two keywords that are written on it, they will represent the attributes of your character.
