It weaves a heaven I see from the spiritual world of the Bible from the perspective of a not so smart but persistent angel \"Mehoo\". This game takes the mode of scanning the specific page under the camera graphics to open the son-interaction-game is not only for the purpose of delivering the health from the heaven country to the people live from far and near, but recommending some Gospel bestsellers that care for the soul. Click \"visit the website\" on the right side of the store page to browse the official post of the game to view the currently open bibliography and pages.<h3>message from the depth of my heart</h3>See the publicity video for the specific operation experience mode. Machine learning in the whole AI industry is still in the pre-school stage, and somatosensory games, as a derivative industry of AI, are no exception. Therefore, I sincerely hope that:<br/>1.\tAbout this game:<br/>-I have adopted the way that every scanning page carries out a plot. I hope that although it's somatosensory game, I still hope to ensure that it has content at least first. After all, the operation of sense of body game is not as convenient and arbitrary as clicking on the screen with the mouse, so the creation space is not so free. At present, the way of browsing the plot dialogue is only to use the virtual button, which takes a lot of time.Therefore, we should first explore the agile and flexible space interaction mode, and then gradually fill in the richness of the game.<br/>- In addition to browsing the plot, the virtual button set in the game also provides a specific page scanning display return button, which is not only designed to facilitate the return and re selection of interactive items, but also because the current stage of somatosensory recognition inevitably has misjudgment. In the game, there is a mechanism to intelligently adjust the position of interactive scenes according to the height, weight and position of the experiencer, such as If the interaction of scene position is uncomfortable due to the misjudgment of the standing position of the person, it also prevents the automatic click due to the misjudgment of the position of the hand, the return button is displayed by scanning the page to confirm that the player has the intention to return subjectively.<br/>- To sum up, I am also actively reforming the internal implementation mode as much as possible, but that's a \"ten-year strategy\" that can't be achieved overnight, so it's inevitable that there are accidents that need to be manually corrected and avoided by players. Please forgive me.<br/>2.\tAbout the industry of somatosensory games:<br/>No matter from software design or offline operation, there is not a relatively formed mode. Developers are walking on the corpses of their predecessors, just like the little overlord who went bankrupt last year. In fact, its sense of body game is quite good, but it is not highly accepted because the experience mode is too old, so we hope that we can support and work together to help sense of body game go through space restrictions and rings The winter when the environment is limited and the player's behavior mode is limited.<br/>3.\tAbout the producer:<br/>A 3D graphics algorithm deduction practitioner is dedicated to the deduction of algorithms such as graphics and image interaction, graphics rendering, geometric deformation and physical motion.
