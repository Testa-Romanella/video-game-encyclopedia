I still liked the project, so I finished it and in time for the Jam too.<br/><br/>Didn't have time to put in a tutorial, so here are the controls:<br/>Press Up Arrow to go forwards.<br/></p>\n<p>Press Right Arrow to turn right.</p>\n<p>Press Left Arrow to turn left.</p>\n<p>Press Z to shoot.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You get 3 lives, and the goal is to last as long as possible. Every lap you finish you get some extra time and some points.<br/></p>\n<p>Killing enemies also gets you points, although you can only shoot straight forwards.<br/></p>\n<p>Mine: 100 points times your lap count.</p>\n<p>Shooter Tower: 200 points times your lap count.</p>\n<p>Plus Shooter Tower: 400 points times you lap count.</p>\n<p>You get extra lives at lap 3, 5, 8, 10, and every 5 laps after 10. But eventually more and more enemies start to spawn, and different kinds of enemies start to spawn later.<br/></p>\n<p>If you run out of lives or time, you lose, but try to shoot for a really high score.</p>\n<p>After the unplayable mess that was my first LD compo, I tried to tone things down and focus on making a game that was playable and fun once you can learn it, and in all of the time practicing by testing the game I've grown a bit attached to how the ship handles, and I'm tempted to finish this project up to the state I wanted it to appear after jam. But for now, there are a few things missing that I just didn't have time for:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>More than 1 level</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>\n<p>A Leaderboard</p>\n<p>Sound</p>\n<p>A video demo tutorial</p>\n<p>And more...</p>\n<p>I hope that its not just me and you can have fun playing this one, and feedback is always appreciated.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>~MusicBlox</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79dae618bbea672ef2a180294d32eb39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MusicBlox"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
