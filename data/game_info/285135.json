It's very silly. I've been wanting to make something with lots of microgames for a while. There should be more but I've rather run out of steam for now; maybe I'll add more later.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you find any bugs. And let me know if you beat it - it shouldn't be too hard as I can beat it and I'm pretty rubbish at reaction based games. There are two difficulty levels which just give different amount of lives.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Controls ... erm ... mouse.<br/></p>\n<p>Lots of resources used from the following:</p>\n<p>www.pixabay.com<br/>https://freepd.com<br/>http://freemusicarchive.org/<br/>https://www.reinerstilesets.de/<br/>https://freesound.org/<br/>https://opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T03:48:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/721/721455890efdd4dd8363912837988b48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["fizzhog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
