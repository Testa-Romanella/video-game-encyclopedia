I tried realistic graphics, 2D graphics, different genres and different points of view. End up with this version because it was the most fun\u00a0to work with.\u00a0Not every feature was released but\u00a0experimenting was fun as hell. I hope you'll enjoy. :)</p>\n<p>(If you\u00a0die, you will have to start the game from the beginning :3)</p>\n<p>Developed by Enixoid</p>\n<p>Music by Nosoapradio.us</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4be/4be3364f8ec8c5b8348a62fab2dd9d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enixoid"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
