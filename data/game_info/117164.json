Six cats who are planning theirs mischiefs!</p>\n<p>In this single player game, you will need to carefully watch what your hooman is doing, and, in his back, steal his meal or, at the very least, pull the laces of his shoes. <br/></p>\n<p>Each cat have specifics characteristics (Chaussette being the most adorable, and Daisy the most deceitful, for example), useful to accomplish a mischief. Theses mischiefs take form of action cards ordonned by three cat'egories :</p>\n<ul><li>Mischiefs, where you go, do the mischief, and then, come back,</li><li>Sly, where you go, steal something, then, come back with your prize,</li><li>Ronron (Purr), where you will attract your hooman, releasing the passage for other cats.</li></ul>\n<p>You will need to do a maximum of these actions before the 75th turns to have the maximum of score points.</p>\n<p>Note : the prototype was not finished, so you can send your cat, but the master will not even care about it. What a lazy master! Oh and sometimes, the game will freeze (maybe tired of the mischiefs of the cats?)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147015bba368e3c9b8678cf2bb4b9bb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hellion Cat"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
