It's all about trapping and bombing ghosts to score points - either individually, or grouped together to form bigger, meaner spooks. It's a simple, fun little time-waster - proof that puzzle games don't have to be complex to be worth playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Debujin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
