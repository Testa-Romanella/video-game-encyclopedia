{"id": 963040, "slug": "typing-bullets", "name": "Typing Bullets", "name_original": "Typing Bullets", "description": "Typing Bullets is a game that was envisioned primarily as a fun way of learning how to type faster and of learning new words. Typing can be fun, and by adding enemies that come after you, you won't even realize that you are getting better at typing. And because you are stepping on all these words, it would be cool to see what they mean. After all, you can't really look in the dictionary and search for a definition while you are being overwhelmed by the enemies. After you land on a new word, its brief definition appears, and if your health reaches zero, you get another shot at continuing your run. A short quiz will appear, with three possible answers, and it asks you what a certain word you have previously encountered means. If you get the right answer, you can go on and get a higher score. Collect new weapons, upgrade your character, learn the joy of typing and learn new words.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Features</h3></strong><br/><ul><li>Typing Bullets is an endless game, where you move and shoot by typing the letters you are currently staying on. The faster you move, the more points you get, the better you get at typing, and the more words you will learn.<br/></li><li>Fight enemies that are based off of keyboard keys: Shift enemy will scramble the platform text, making it more difficult to see what keyboard key you should press; Percentage enemy gives you either a bonus or a negative effect; Pause enemy creates, at regular intervals, an area near it that slows down your shots; At enemy will make your projectiles go in a spiral; and expect all sorts of other similar enemy types.<br/></li><li>Use different weapons to defend yourself against these threats, from lasers and lightning bolts, to projectiles that bounce around the level, and many others. You can collect something that fits your playstyle. Manually adjust the angle of your bullets and shoot either by typing, or stand still and shoot manually. While each defeated enemy will spawn an Ammo pack, only after you jump on a new word will these packs accelerate towards you.<br/></li><li>Each time you reach the end of a word, you emit a powerful blast that destroys enemy projectiles and moves enemies away, giving you more space. And each time you type/move, you get some iframes, so if you keep typing, you are safe.<br/></li><li>After each successful key press, an energy bar slowly fills up, and when it reaches its maximum limit, you will also shoot out a shockwave blast. The more health you have, the longer it takes for this energy bar to fill up.<br/></li><li>Collect upgrade points as you go, which you can use to customize your ship. Increase the maximum ammo amount, increase the chances of firing homing missiles each time you shoot, increase the time you get to answer in the Quiz Respawn mechanic, and discover many other upgrades that can change each run and that fit your play style.<br/></li><li>After you land on a new word, its brief definition will appear under the keys. If your health reaches zero, you will get a short timed quiz, and if you answer correctly, you can continue your current run.<br/></li><li>Slow down time to gain some precious moments to aim and consider your next move.<br/></li><li>Learn in a fun way with a word list consisting of tens of thousands of words and their definitions.</li></ul><br/><strong><h3>NOTES</h3></strong><br/>Typing Bullets is mainly a game where you try to get a high score. While it has replay value, and there are lots and lots of words to learn, enemies to fight and weapons and upgrades to try out, it is basically a score attack game. And a typing game, that also aims to help you learn new words as well. If you think this is the type of game you would like, give it a try. I really hope you enjoy it. Typing Bullets is expected to release soon, but it is still a game in development, so expect some modifications and improvements from what is seen in the trailer.<br/><br/>And a <strong>very important</strong> note on the words that may appear in the game: games should be enjoyed by everybody, and so I did my best to remove all the bad and hateful words that I could find. I am aware that I might have missed some, so if you do find words that fit that criteria, such as words that are misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, offensive to ethnicities or offensive to religions, or in any other way affect you emotionally or trigger emotional trauma, please let me know and I will do my best to remove these words and their definitions as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Credits</h3></strong><br/><ul><li>Made with L\u00d6VE.<br/></li><li>Word list and definitions: Simple English Dictionary, by nightblade9, from GitHub (MIT License)<br/></li><li>Font used: m5x7 by Daniel Linssen<br/></li><li>Keyboard sounds: \"Type\" by Shapeforms Audio<br/></li><li>Trailer song: \"Canon in D chill arrange\" by syncopika (from OpenGameArt) (CC0)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T03:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4f24be3cfc1a6d7a93442c36d044a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cip"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["cip"], "esrb_rating": null}
