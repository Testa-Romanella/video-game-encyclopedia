After a few generations a war broke out causing most of the knowledge and technology about travel to new solar system to be lost. How evar as the leader of the group that is still living on the space station striving for peace and the restoration of past technology. When you find out that sun is on the course to explode you quickly began to travel to the planets trying to convince the residents to put down their weapons and join in the attempt to save humanity.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get 200K scientists back to the space station (the gray planet).</p>\n<p>To get more scientists you have to go to planets drop off scientists to set up scientific outpost.</p>\n<p>Green planets must have 10K on to set up scientific outpost, Blue needs 10K, Orange needs 25 and Red needs 5.</p>\n<p>The Red planet has the quickest scientist production rate. Followed by orange then blue and the slowest green.</p>\n<p>But be careful because the residence of the planet can began to attack your outpost. This is indicated by a red exclamation mark on the bottom of a planet followed by a countdown when the time hits zero any scientists that are on the planet and not taking refuge in the spaceship or on another planet will be halved.</p>\n<p>The riskiest planets ranked from highest to lowest (Red,Blue,Orange,Green).</p>\n<p>When on a planet you use the up and down arrow keys to transfer scientists ( hold right shift and arrow keys to quickly transfer ).</p>\n<p>To take off, press the spacebar. while in space you have a limited amount of fuel (the numbers under the spaceship) while in space you can either turn or thrust but only one at a time. To land just hit the planet. Avoid the asteroids and the sun if you die you will lose all but 1K of the scientists on board.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdb0016d1e528a388840c1e5cb5ad83e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TurboHenry"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
