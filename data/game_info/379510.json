At the time we didn\u2019t know better than letting it control all of our automated work force. A disaster waiting to happen as the AI went rogue.<br/><br/>In Rise of Humanity you take control of a band of odd heroes who so far have survived the onslaught that started 50 years ago. They have discovered that the robots the AI uses to do its bidding are getting weaker and this is the time to strike back.<br/><br/>Each hero (and enemy) is controlled by a deck of cards. This deck gives your characters actions during a mission. Each mission is played out on a hexagonal grid in a strategic turn-based manner. Missions are procedurally build so no mission is ever the same.<br/><br/>Destroying enemies and finishing missions gives you access to new cards for your heroes. You built their deck as you play the game! However if they die, they will lose their progress so every decision counts!<br/><br/>Will you be the one to save humanity and let it rise again from the ashes of this onslaught?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T03:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be71f7b1bdc8248899fa731ccf7ef9a.jpg", "website": "http://www.riseofhumanitygame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cybernetic Walrus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Cybernetic Walrus"], "esrb_rating": null}
