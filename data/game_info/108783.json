If you are looking for that project, this is it. It is now called Brimstone.<br/></p><p>\n<strong>Brimstone</strong> is a first person, fast paced 3D hack and slasher game, developed by a passionate indie game development team. It is inspired by old school retro first person games such as <em>Doom</em> and <em>Shadow Warrior</em>.</p>The premise:<p>\nYou're stuck in a pit in hell, and you can't get out. You're surrounded by sinners, demons, and a myriad of hellish creatures, and they aren't just there for company. They want to devour your soul, and then do worse things to it.\r\n</p>What we're planning\r\nSatisfaction:\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou obviously aren't unarmed. You're equipped with a powerful sword, and since you're stuck, you've got all day to kill. This game is pretty bloody, and definitely not for the lighthearted. Increased satisfaction with a killing spree system, and grenades.\r\n</p>\r\nHacking n' slash in style:\r\n<p>\n<em>[Not added yet] </em>You will be able to select from a ludicrous but exciting range of weapons to defend yourself and bash your enemies, from a tennis racket, a toy seagull to powerful weapons like a katana or even the buster blade.\r\n</p>Multiplayer:<p>\n<em>[Not added yet]</em><em> </em>This is a definitely planned feature, as this game was designed for multiplayer. And who doesn't like playing games with friends?\r\n</p>Variety of enemies to kill:<p>There is a planned list of hellspawn to add in. They will be challenging and very satisfying to kill. So far there are sinner's, that are weak but strong in numbers, demons that take time to kill and can shoot fireballs, and wandering soul's, that explode if you touch them.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>NOTE: Brimstone is still in Alpha stage, and uncompleted. It is under heavy testing and constant development.</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade in the Unity 3D engine.\r\n</p>Follow the gameDiscord:<p>\r\n\thttps://discord.gg/RtQ4fYx\r\n</p>Twitter:<p>\r\n\thttps://twitter.com/plectrumsoftwar\r\n</p>Youtube:<p>\r\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6mla0DqcD3gq11UgsHHneA\r\n</p>Facebook:<p>https://www.facebook.com/groups/265884343865425/<br/></p>Update Log:<p>\r\n\thttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4BGNRDUcaDqfu...\r\n</p>Email:<p>\r\n\tblackjack27304@gmail.com\r\n</p><p>\n<em>A game by Plectrum Software</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d02021094313e29ad70943c0ef1d3677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["plectrumSoftware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
