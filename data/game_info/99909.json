But the point here is that :</p>\r\n\"The more you have power, the worse the game experience is.\"\r\n<p>This is our interpretation of the topic.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if you come to the boss with full power, you one-shot it and the game stops.<br/>The only way to extend and enjoy the game is to come and provoke the boss with minimum power collected.<br/><br/><strong>Our goal is to highlight that our instinctive gamer-behaviour (the looting in this case) may not be the right moral choice (all friendly NPC die to ease your task), neither the right way to have fun.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0------------------------------------------<br/><br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/aatmo<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made by : </strong>Julian <strong>&amp;</strong> Thibaud\u00a0<strong>&amp;</strong> Julien <strong>&amp;</strong> Leonaaard<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a99a282c12b8760a7a9139e2dc284d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GamingNight"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
