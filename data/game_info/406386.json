Knights, though named intentionally to have a very similar name as the popular game \"Shovel Knight\" as\u00a0 a salutation, is actually a very different game. This is a prototype top-down, action, local pvp game developed by the leaders of the Orange Lutheran High School Game Design/Development Club two high schoolers: Xiaocong Yan and Henry Turbedsky, with the former in charge of art and animation and the latter person in charge of programming. We are now working hard to polish the game before spring and publish the official version, which is going to have so much more features and playability. Stay tuned!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art/Animation/Design:\u00a0\u00a0Xiaocong(Bill) Yan</p>\n<p>Programmer/Editor:\u00a0 Henry Turbedsky</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db8e9745fa4f2144c59998c208d0237.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xiaocong Yan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
