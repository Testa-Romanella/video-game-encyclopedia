A fledgling lil\u2019 birdy who is exploring the world to find their very own song. Navigate the levels and dodge obstacles while collecting notes along the way. When you have found your song, return to your nest and family to sing your Birb song! We wanted to combine a cute game with a peaceful, meditation-like experience to help focus and calm the mind.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Utilising 528Hz frequency music to help you find peace and relaxation\r\n</li><li>Incorporation of nature and bird sounds to help ease the mind\r\n</li><li>The cute, and appealing imagery\r\n</li><li>Simple controls and concept\r\n</li><li>Clean UI, free from distractions\r\n</li><li>3 levels that progress slightly in difficulty to help engage the mind without being too challenging\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Release Date, Platform, Price</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>22/08/2021\r\n</li><li>PC\r\n</li><li>Free!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Why Hertz Music?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The initial concept of our game was a mix of two ideas; a cute platformer where a duck had to collect food, and a game targeted at meditation where the act of collecting music brings a meditative state within the player, with music specifically chosen to help calm the mind.\r\n</p>\n<p>We have found that the best frequency our game should match would be of 528Hz as it boosts serotonin levels, enhances inner healing and calmness, reduces tinnitus, increases relaxation and amplifies mindfulness.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>By using frequencies associated with a variety of mental states, the chosen music will entrain the audience's brainwaves with a specific emotion, by emitting frequencies in and around a certain range, with the intention of achieving the brain state associated with that frequency.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each tone includes a frequency that has a particular effect on the mind and body such as healing, relaxation, balancing chakras and in general keeping the mind and body in harmony with nature.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meet the Team!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>T. I. Ritzchie Gayatri - Lead Artist, Lead Animator &amp; Level Designer\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(cloverdandelionz@gmail.com)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ritzchie has been passionate about art ever since primary school. She started pursuing her art and design dream by participating in some illustration and film projects and is currently undertaking a game design course upon finishing high school. Creating 2D assets for Birb is her first experience in doing so for a real game. Her favourite part during the game making process is animating the assets she created.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Leyla Ozluk - Lead Sound Designer &amp; Programmer</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(leylasimone@live.com.au)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Leyla is currently a game design and development student, she\u2019s had experience in film, music and games, working on previous unfinished games using C++, C# and python. Birb is her first publicly released game, and the first group produced the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Savannah Catherall - Project Manager &amp; Programmer</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(s.j.catherall@outlook.com.au)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nSavannah has been coding since 2019, starting with HTML and moving onto C++ and C#. This was her first attempt at coding a game from start to finish, she had a great experience and an even better team. A massive gaming nerd since a young age; Savannah grew up playing Warcraft II, Age of Empires, Final Fantasy 7 and Morrowind as her staples. Her favourite games of all time are a hard tie between the Mass Effect series and the Last of Us series. Mass Effect for its incredible narrative and character development. Last of Us for a lot of the same, but Part II for being so innovative in the world of UX/UI and releasing the most accessible game to date.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T04:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54935e1f08e376384110d3a2b18f0f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cloverdandelionz", "scatherall", "Frog_Features"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
