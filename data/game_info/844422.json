Collect items to craft weird weapons and useful objects that will help you traverse the world in this unplanned escapade.<br/> <br/>It was supposed to be a relaxing vacation but ditch the itinerary because you\u2019ll now need to choose your own path. Navigate through procedurally generated levels that offer the perfect balance of risk and reward. Help Giorgio and Felicie overcome their differences and work as a team in single-player or co-op. However you play, you\u2019ll need to work together to conquer the unique obstacles and challenges scattered throughout each world.<br/><br/><h3>Go it alone or find a real human. </h3>Play as either Giorgio or Felicie in solo, co-op or vs mode. Easily switch between characters to use each of their unique characteristics.<h3>Boat not included</h3>It\u2019s fun to explore but don\u2019t hang about for too long because these temples flood! Grab what you can and get to the exit before it\u2019s too late. Oh, and please don\u2019t leave your partner behind\u2026<h3>No Deja Vu here!</h3>Navigate your way through hordes of ghastly ancient creatures while exploring randomly generated temples, threats and exit locations.
