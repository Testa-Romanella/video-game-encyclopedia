{"id": 398367, "slug": "kampf-dem-virus", "name": "Kampf dem Virus", "name_original": "Kampf dem Virus", "description": "<p>Kampf dem Virus (German vor \"Fight the Virus\") is a game where players play a doctor battling infections in tissue by using pills. In every round, there is a certain amount of infected tissue and the player wins the game if all infections get cured. The problem is, in the tissue, there are tons of viruses and together, they can create new infections needing to be removed. <br/><br/>If the number of infections gets too bad, the patient dies and the player loses the game.<br/><br/>The Easy Mode is called Privatpatient (patient with Private health insurance in german) and the Hard Mode is called Kassenpatient (patient with Public Health insurance in german).<br/><br/>If you choose Privatpatient/\"Private health insurance\" mode, the game is really easy and you can save the patient without much effort. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you choose \"Kassenpatient\"/\"Public health insurance\" mode, your job as doctor will be pretty harsh and the survival of the patient is not that likely. <br/><br/>The game is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Ctrl or Space lets you use pills.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33ce6d89f203afff52d555ce27ea581a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Phoenix UG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
