{"id": 750242, "slug": "super-hero-city", "name": "Super Hero City", "name_original": "Super Hero City", "description": "<p>Super Hero city is a simply sped up story about what it takes to become a super hero. Normally an individual is required to prove their worth by helping ordinary citizens but in this city you must help the immediate 4 super heroes around you. All the heroes have lost their phones and if you collect all of them they will show you the way to hero headquarters and you will be allowed to enter. You use the normal WASD controls for movement and SPACE\u00a0 to interact\u00a0but use the F key to toggle on and off flight mode. In flight mode you have increased mobility.\u00a0 I wanted this game to focus heavily on player movement while flying as well as visually catch the players eye. I think Super Hero City portrays everything I wanted but also keeps the player involved and entertained.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In terms of making the game I think the process went well. I had some struggles when it came to depth and text boxes showing up on top of each other as well as all my sprites as a whole. Drawing sprite animations from scratch took longer and were a lot harder than I\u00a0predicted. The overall look of the game is something I wish I could improve upon. I didn't struggle too much with the mechanics of the game but the process of making it looks ok and bringing all the pieces together was difficult. Overall, the think the game came out well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d931febb0b49f445d94c338f74cc47e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sojiadenusi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
