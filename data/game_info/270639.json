The one I have right now is pretty bad and struggles to preform a lot of basic tasks. The reason why I'm now looking for supporters is because I need a new laptop, so I can continue to make more games for my followers. With a new laptop, I can continue to create games in less than half the time it normally takes with this one. My end goal would be to hopefully someday put together a full team of game developers (since I am currently the only member), and develop great indie games for many years to come!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/6934b61446aacc24dd6452c27210a58f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tythedodo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
