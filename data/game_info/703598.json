{"id": 703598, "slug": "tempovr", "name": "tempoVR", "name_original": "tempoVR", "description": "<p>TempoVR is a proof of concept\u00a0VR\u00a0rhythm game with a time based twist! Hitting the notes on beat gives you points, increases your combo and\u00a0gains you energy.\u00a0Dodge obstacles\u00a0and bombs to avoid losing your combo multiplier and points.\u00a0Once you have enough energy, the tempo of the track can be modified by holding either\u00a0the trigger or the\u00a0grip on the controller to either speed up or\u00a0slow down time. Obstacles slow you down and sap your energy and missing notes costs points and your combo multiplier\u00a0so be careful! Race the clock to complete songs, considering how a balance between speed and accuracy can net you the highest score!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game supports levels created in the\u00a0Beat Saber format, with maps able to be acquired from\u00a0https://beatsaver.com/\u00a0or https://bsaber.com\u00a0\u00a0The jam version just loads a pre-made level as we didn't have time to implement a level loader as initially planned.\u00a0 We will possibly look into adding this feature at a later date.</p>\n<p>There are a number of features not fully implemented and tuned and the game is buggy and incomplete.\u00a0The webXR build in particular has problematic controller\u00a0input. We have hotfixed this to work with rebound controls though they are slightly unintuitive. Let us know how it works for you :)</p>\n<p>It is also possible to \"preview\" the game in non VR. Though it isn't possible to play the game in non-VR, we\u00a0have implemented a fps character controller so that you are able to walk around the scene and see the game being played. The implementation is very rough so your mileage may vary.</p><p>We recommend to download the executable file for the best experience!</p>\n<p>If you like tempoVR and would like to see continued development please let us know!<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------</p>\n<p>Programming and Design: @grave-bud and @guysoft</p>\n<p>Art: @grave-bud</p>\n<p>Music and Sfx: @sonofluiz</p><p>Anthony Font Copyright (c) 2021, Sun Young Oh <hello@sunyoungoh.com></hello@sunyoungoh.com></p><p>This game uses texture resources from the Kenney Particle Pack</p>\n<p>-----------------<br/></p>\n<p>The game is also hosted on our private servers:</p>\n<p>WebXR:\u00a0https://gnethomelinux.com/files/EnergySource/</p>\n<p>Non WebXR:\r\nhttps://gnethomelinux.com/files/EnergySource-nonvr\r\n</p>\n<p>-----------------</p>\n<p>The game is open source and the code is at:<br/>https://github.com/guysoft/EnergySource<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bdbffbb22c23d11201dfe1935e0d610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Guy Sheffer", "Grave Bud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
