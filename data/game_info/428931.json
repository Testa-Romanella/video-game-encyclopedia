Make it more durable, make it faster, or switch out your harpoon for something more interesting. You'll need to choose the right submarine for you.<h3>Gotta Catch 'Em All</h3><br/>All the wildlife you find throughout the game can be caught, but it doesn't mean they are going to make it easy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:09:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/7597c6e5e0317994a1f74deab92b463c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Periodic Group"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Periodic Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
