We've barely started development, but here's what we've got!</p>\n<p>Your faves are falling in love in a coffeeshop! How familiar.</p>\n<p>Come write dialogue and stories with us on Discord!! We're planning on having visual-novel style stories for each included ship!</p>\n<p>Thank you Prie for the furniture! Thank you TricolorStar and Loop for the music! Thank you everyone on discord because I lov u\u00a0\u2661</p>\n<p>Stay updated on Tumblr!</p>\r\nHOW TO \"PLAY\" (haha)\r\n<p>So, uh, to make \u00a0coffee, you drag one of the cans to the\u00a0\u201ccoffee machine,\u201d the first transparent box. you can increase the coffee\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccoffee\u201d\u00a0stat by dropping ur barista into that box, uh, multiple times haha. you can add milk by letting your barista sit in the second transparent box. You can also see what\u2019s going on with your coffee, and how you scored last time, in the upper right corner. Each color of coffee blend has a personality! Each customer has a specific (and in this case, unique) taste.</p>\n<p>Finally, serve up the coffee by dragging you barista to the cash register area! if you did well, the customer will have a happy expression. If you didn't,\u00a0they will react with shock.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T04:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/5412ddc70500d364719d773cbba93c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Melissa Ran"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
