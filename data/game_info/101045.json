This was originally built for the Oculus DK2 in 2015 but I have updated it using UnrealEngine 4.18 and Oculus 1.17 Runtime (Thanks, Jess, for lending me the headset!)</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS - Ideally sit in a chair with no back. When the app loads up, adjust your position with your mouse to match the new body you inhabit. Once the experience begins, look all around you or just look in front of you but adjust the direction using the mouse.</p>\n<p>The experience ends when you go back into the body you were in to begin with. You can quit using the space bar.</p>\n<p>The whole thing takes around 8 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fdd2718c154e0d5ac1927e03b7b93acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeremycouillard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
