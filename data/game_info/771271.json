That when you exit the bunker, the very sun would dim in the midst of nuclear winter. Instead, you were greeted to a world devastated by what no one conceived in their wildest dreams \u2013 that all men just died out.<br/><br/><h3>EXPANSIVE SHELTER MANAGEMENT</h3><br/>Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, and neither will your base of operations. From an old, derelict safehouse to a full-blown, <strong>high-tech fortress</strong>, scour the wastelands for resources, carefully plan the layout and reach the heights you deserve.<br/><br/><h3>A WORLD FULL OF WOMEN</h3><br/>As the (possibly) last surviving male on the continent, you have more than just new lands to conquer. More than <strong>40 girls</strong> across the wastes may yet join your cause and provide bounties unheard of \u2013 listen to them, <strong>forge relationships</strong> that could outlast nuclear fire and reap the sweet rewards.<br/><br/><h3>A FRESH, UNIQUE SETTING</h3><br/>Technocrats enslave the few surviving male specimens in underground laboratories, trappers roam the green, untouched wilds and mystery cults still await the return of a promised messiah \u2013 an unshackled, unsullied Man.
