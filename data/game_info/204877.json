It was designed as a mobile game, and the computer version is a straight port, with ads removed. This game is a first step to bigger games I would like to make. \u00a0Support me if you want to see more games in this style of universe.</p>\n<p>Fill your down time by running around planets and collecting various animals. By fulfilling contracts you can collect money that you can spend on upgrading your speed, damage and other various stats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you can complete enough contracts you can earn bonus gems to get power fruits and shields that will give you temporary boosts to your next run. Keep an eye out for gardens that grow power fruits to give you a free boost. In every level there is a secret garden that grows the most powerful of all fruit, but you may need to learn to fly in order to find it.</p>\n<p>While out adventuring keep an eye out for predators that will kill you instead of being collected. Shooting them will reward you with points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e814c3ba126f01291a125e066907c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frost Dragon Empire"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
