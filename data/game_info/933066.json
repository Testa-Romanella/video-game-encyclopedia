It's my first time using L\u00d6VE2D and my first time using the Lua language.</p><p>As a result, my 'entry' is nowhere near as complete as I'd planned (not that I'd really made any solid plans, tbh - the project folder for this is called 'HelloLove'!). In all, it was a couple of afternoons' work.</p>\n<p>I was impressed by the audio functionality of\u00a0L\u00d6VE and decided to make a game based round its abilities. It fitted nicely into the theme of 'Connection', too.</p>\n<p>What you CAN do is:</p>\n<p>* Use the mouse to control the Amplifier.<br/>* Avoid LPs!<br/>* Hold the left mouse button, then release to 'shoot' a lead<br/>* 'Vanish' LPs!<br/>* Plug in FX pedals!!!</p>\n<p>Connect as many FX pedals as you can. You'll find:</p>\n<p>* Distortion!<br/>* Flanger!<br/>* Chorus!<br/>* Echo!<br/>* Ring Modulator!<br/>* Tremolo!<br/>* Reverb!</p><p>It's really not a complete and/or challenging game, though.<br/></p>\n<p>The guitar loop is by me, and I'm not a very skilled player, so sorry!<br/></p>\n<p>The graphics are also by me and I think I done alright with those :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for looking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b99c37c2bdb52a071ef19e29578db02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ric Haines Makes Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
