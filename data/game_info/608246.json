I really liked the theme for  this jam, and it was a lot of fun making this game. Since the theme is  'You are not the hero', I figured it was a cool idea if you controlled  an alien flying in an UFO, trying to zap other humans and convert them  into aliens. That's where the first wildcard, 'Transmutation' comes in.  I've also used the wildcard 'Getting Rich'. You use the aliens as a  workforce for upgrading your UFO, so you need a certain amount of aliens  for each upgrade. The aliens themselves are the currency! <br/></p>\n<p>Hope you like this game, and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569730bf44999a9553a1b4b6bd03cd76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BrownCheese"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
