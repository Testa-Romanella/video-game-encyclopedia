The game is all about clearing the fruits. Shoot the fruits before the worms eat them.<br/><br/>Gameplay/Rules :-<br/><br/>Whenever three or more fruits of the same type and color are shot together they disappear/vanish. So try to place the fruits of the same type together so that more fruits explode and vanish and you get more points. For placing the fruits you need to tap in the direction you want to place them.<br/><br/>The more fruits you shoot at one go the more points you earn. Several such fouls lead to add a new line of fruits at the top. The game would not get over until  the fruits are away from the worms so just keep on shooting the fruits of the same type and have fun while doing so.<br/><br/><br/>Features include :-<br/><br/>1) Simple UI <br/>2) Addictive gameplay <br/>3) Cool music and sound effects <br/>4) View your current score, high score and the number of moves taken anytime <br/>5) Nice animation <br/>6) No IAP, universal support and awesome gameplay!<br/><br/>Try it yourself!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/ece87e0d25dc287008752a568b589207_dDS6LL3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
