It's about killing for sport and reaping organs for reward. It drops the player in a city with only three things, a small knife, a large weapon, and a desire to take the kidneys from every human in sight. Perfect for every player, it can be played casually or strategically depending on just what the player wants from the game and every play style is rewarded.Complex IntelligenceEvery swipe of the sword and every thrust of your knife creates a complex series of responses from the complicated AI. Citizens will tell the police if they see you commit a crime and police will act on what information they provide. Gangs will leave the player alone if not messed with and attack the player or other gangs when stimulated. It gets deeper than this but past that is a secret.Procedural Generation, the Words Everybody LovesNearly everything in this game is procedural: The buildings, the sky, the ground, AI characteristics (including all physical features and mobility), gang spawns, ghosts, and a dynamic difficulty curve for police spawns.WeaponsThe player is given a small variety of weapons to choose from and to upgrade to using kidneys in the shop. Both the fast attack and the power attack weapons can be upgraded with four weapons available as of now in each category.Player UpgradesYou have the option to purchase different character abilities when you get achievements. Some of which include: more starting health, longer slow-motion, faster speed, and a few other things.LeaderboardThere is an awesome and informative leaderboard that keeps track of player scores across the world and provides a breakdown of their score!SoundThe Pillage has an amazing theme and soundtrack produced by David Sherman as well as some awesome sound effects from Vawlt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-18T19:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db2ce8745f113470b93d939d9776473.jpg", "website": "http://www.thepillage.net/", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 112, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bishop Armstrong"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bishop Armstrong"], "esrb_rating": null}
