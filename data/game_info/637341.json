I\u00a0just remember working on it during class with @ganbariley\u00a0when we were supposed to be working on\u00a0Social Studies. Back then though, we were gonna try to make a game like Hero Core by Daniel\u00a0Remar\u00a0at the time.</p>\n<p>Since then the idea evolved and sadly what\u00a0I have for you here is... well calling it a shadow of the idea would be generous.</p>\n<p>Sub-Terra has a lot more meat to the idea than I presented here. Maybe by the time I actually sit down with it, I'll know which parts to cut and which to keep, but for now the entire bloated thing lives in my head. Some of the stuff that exists in the mind version:</p>\n<ul><li>A timer, to allow the ending to shift based on how long it took (and possibly force an end game state if you took too long</li><li>Factions, who provide different weapons, and hopefully playstyles, and would also affect the ending</li><li>Multiple weapons beyond the basic blaster. Which was supposed to be a pistol.</li><li>Co-op???</li><li>An actual story, as compared to me just throwing you into the caves here.</li></ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, I\u00a0ran out of time and energy to work on this, as I had started a new job right at the start of the Jam, hah. So it will cut off abruptly, and it's probably buggy and unpolished. But I\u00a0gotta call it here for my own sanity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:32:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f9efae187585832ff4c5a9a3ea5411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RoboDusty"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
