(After voting of course :P )</p>\n<p>Things that are in:</p><ul><li>Crafting (press the \"R\" key to find it!)</li><li>A dynamic inventory, item and recipe system that makes adding more really easy.</li><li>Theoretically infinite procedurally generated terrain with two \"biomes\", trees will only grow in the grassy one.</li><li>Freely diggable terrain that is persistent, and choppable trees that wobble.</li><li>A full day/night cycle with music to punctuate.</li><li>The skeleton of a base-building system.</li></ul>\n<p>I(I may come back later and polish up this page, but I will only be uploading fundamental fixes if in the case of .exe-breaking bugs until the gamejam judging period is over)</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The linux build may, or may not, work. Sadly I didn't have time to test it before running out of time at the end of the game jam, but I've included it here just in case it\u00a0<em>does</em> work, and helps someone out.</p>\n<p>Also included is a 32-bit build of the game for Windows. Same proviso applies. Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>As for assets used</strong>:</p>\n<p>Music was created using the awesome\u00a0https://openai.com/blog/musenet/\u00a0Musenet AI. Go check it out and have a play, 10/10 recommend creating Music in the style of Bach based off the intro to Harry Potter any day!</p>\n<p>The sprites used were largely taken from or edited from the freely available:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181<br/>Opengameart as a site is a fantastic resource for game-jammers.
