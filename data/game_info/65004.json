In fact, Lenin caters to all the symptoms of depression. Worse, his mother does not understand why his son was born this way, and the whole village despises him and treats him cruelly. At school, he suffers bullying and can\u2019t concentrate on class.<br/><br/>Now, hopeless about life, certain situations seem to awaken in Lenin something that is not of everyone\u2019s reality, but only of his. Something he will discover to be part of something else.<br/>Besides, Lenin will find other<strong> species of animals</strong>, which may help him to understand himself.<br/>However, things are getting dangerous and Lenin needs to take care with his actions (your actions).<br/><br/>Traveling between normality and a strange place, Lenin will have to face his inner fears and enemies \u2013 and often, the outer ones as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lenin - The Lion is like a typical aerial-view RPGs of the SNES or Gameboy Color classics. The difference here is given by some criteria:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>There are no battles or levels:</strong> all actions taken by the player are through conversations with NPC's, puzzles and varied options.<br/></li><li><strong>There is always more than one choice to proceed:</strong> yes, though many games work with \"moral choices\", in Lenin - The Lion choices don't change the character profile, but how is the unfolding of the plot. With this in mind, there are always at least two different paths to the same part of the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>World filled with references to depression, its effects and treatments.<br/></li><li>No battle systems or levels.<br/></li><li>Lenin\u2019s backpack is his menu.
