SOUNDS EASY, BUT EACH LAP NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN A REQUIRED AMOUNT OF TIME, AND EACH LAP GETS PROGRESSIVELY QUICKER WITH MORE HAZARDS.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>TO HELP COMBAT THESE HAZARDS, YOUR ORB IS EQUIPPED WITH BOTH A GUN AND A BRAKE. THESE CAN THEN BE USED TO DESTROY CERTAIN HAZARDS AND AVOID OTHER HAZARDS.</p>\n<p>LAP TIMES</p>\n<p>AS MENTIONED, YOU NEED TO COMPLETE EACH LAP WITHIN A REQUIRED AMOUNT OF TIME. THIS IS SHOWN DURING THE GAME VIA THE CIRCLE AND A DELTA LAP TIME WITHIN THE CIRCLE.</p>\n<p>THE DELTA LAP TIME INDICATES WHETHER YOU'RE ON TARGET TO COMPLETE THE LAP ON TIME. A POSITIVE DELTA LAP TIME INDICATES THE NUMBER OF SECONDS YOU'RE AHEAD AND A NEGATIVE DELTA LAP TIME ALONG WITH A FLASHING CIRCLE INDICATES THE NUMBER OF SECONDS YOU'RE BEHIND.</p>\n<p>BE CAREFUL, BRAKING TO AVOID A HAZARD WILL REDUCE THE DELTA LAP TIME, BUT COLLECTING A BLUE PICKUP WILL INCREASE THE DELTA LAP TIME.</p>\n<p>FOR REFERENCE, IN ADDITION TO THE DELTA LAP TIME THE CURRENT LAP NUMBER IS ALSO SHOWN WITHIN THE CIRCLE.</p>\n<p>ENERGY</p>\n<p>AT THE START OF THE LEVEL THE ORB WILL BE ASSIGNED A FULL BAR OF ENERGY. AS THE ORB TAKES DAMAGE\u00a0</p>\n<p>THE ENERGY WILL SLOWLY DECREASE, AND WHEN IT HITS 0% IT'S GAME OVER.</p>\n<p>TO HELP RECOVER ENERGY, AT THE END OF EACH LAP ENERGY WILL BE AWARDED BASED ON THE DELTA LAP TIME, AND ALSO DURING THE LAP ENERGY IS AWARDED BY COLLECTED A GREEN PICKUP.</p>\n<p>PICKUPS</p>\n<p>SHOOTING A MOVING ENEMY WILL OCCASIONALLY CAUSE A PICKUP TO BE SPAWNED; COLLECTING A GREEN PICKUP WILL INCREASE THE ORBS ENERGY, WHILST COLLECTING A BLUE PICKUP WILL INCREASE THE ORBS DELTA LAP TIME.</p>\n<p>GUN UPGRADES</p>\n<p>AT THE START OF EACH LEVEL THE ORB WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO FIRE A SINGLE STREAM OF BULLETS. AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE LEVEL YOU CAN INCREASE THE ORBS FIREPOWER BY SHOOTING BLUE ORBS.</p>\n<p>SHOOTING THESE BLUE ORBS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE THE UPGRADE BAR AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE SCREEN, EVENTUALLY UPGRADING THE ORB WITH UPTO 4 BULLET UPGRADES.</p>\n<p>GAME OVER</p>\n<p>THE GAME IS OVER WHEN YOU EITHER FAIL THE LEVEL OR COMPLETE SIX LAPS WITHIN THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF TIME. PLEASE NOTE THE LEVEL IS FAILED IF THE ORB ENERGY REACHES 0% OR YOU FAIL TO COMPLETE A LAP WITHIN THE REQUIRED LAP TIME.</p>\n<p>LEVEL RECORDS</p>\n<p>TO HELP COMPETITIVE GAMEPLAY, THE BEST LEVEL COMPLETION TIME WILL BE RECORDED FOR EACH LEVEL. THESE TIMES WILL BE SHOWN ON THE MAIN MENU, AND DURING GAMEPLAY THE COUNTER BENEATH THE ENERGY BAR WILL SHOW PROGRESS AGAINST THE CURRENT BEST LEVEL TIME.</p>\n<p>A NEGATIVE VALUE WILL INDICATE THE NUMBER OF SECONDS YOU'RE BEATING THE CURRENT LEVEL RECORD, WHILST A POSITIVE VALUE WILL INDICATE THE NUMBER OF SECONDS YOU'RE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT LEVEL RECORD.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS AND KEYS</p>\n<p>A or Left Arrow - LEFT</p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow - RIGHT</p>\n<p>RIGHT SHIFT or LEFT SHIFT - BRAKE</p>\n<p>ESCAPE - PAUSE/RESUME GAME</p>\n<p>NOTE: FIRING IS AUTOMATIC</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>I HOPE YOU ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME, AND I WELCOME COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK TO:</p>\n<p>@ROBGMORAN</p>\n<p>ROBERT_G_MORAN@YAHOO.COM</p>\n<p>ALSO PLEASE CHECK OUT MY EARLIER GAMES:</p>\n<p>https://robgm.itch.io/pump-action</p>\n<p>https://robgm.itch.io/voxbot</p>\n<p>GOOGLE PLAY</p>\n<p>- BLOCKY BLITZ</p>\n<p>SPECIAL THANKS GOES TO THE FOLLOWING ASSETS THAT WERE USED TO CREATE THIS GAME:</p>\n<p>UNITY ASSET STORE ASSETS</p>\n<p>DREAMTECK SPLINES BY DREAMTECK</p>\n<p>SPACE AUDIO BUNDLE BY EVIL MIND</p>\n<p>YUGHUES FREE METAL MATERIALS BY NOBIAX/YUGHUES</p>\n<p>EMISSIVE LIGHT PANEL MATERIALS BY COLE</p>\n<p>STYLIZED EXPLOSION PACK 1 BY EFFECTCORE</p>\n<p>SHAPES FX PACK BY ORANGED KEYS</p>\n<p>SCI-FI UI_COMPONENTS V1 BY D.F.Y STUDIO</p>\n<p>SKYBOX VOLUME 2 (NEBULA) BY HEDGEHOG TEAM</p>\n<p>SPEECH</p>\n<p>https://voicegenerator.io/</p>\n<p>https://voicechanger.io/</p>\n<p>MAIN MENU MUSIC</p>\n<p>Time Rider by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>LEVEL MUSIC</p>\n<p>Alfa by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</p>\n<p>Azure by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</p>\n<p>Break Down Barriers by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</p>\n<p>HAVE FUN</p>\n<p>ROB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/594b8761ccfcf9dcabdb1f15e1128bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["robgm"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
