I did try to incorporate as many references to\u00a0<em>The Room</em> as humanly possible, while also getting the charm Tommy Wiseau radiates in interviews and his wonderful AMA on Reddit.</p>\n<p>None of this is intended to mean any harm or be anything other than a fictional game some person is uploading to expand her itch.io profile and have a chuckle with her friends. I personally love\u00a0<em>The Room\u00a0</em>and the creator, and would never want to mean any harm to him.</p>\n<p>None of this game is being used for revenue. It's an entirely personal project I make $0.00 off of each and every day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay is rather short, because sadly I have other things to work on, both visual novels and a job itself. If interest in this happens, I may consider doing another one, but for now, there is no sequel. There's a few other games based on this absolutely glorious movie out there, and I highly recommend you show them support, too!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this, nevertheless. Even if it is, uh, of debatable quality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Brianna</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2798fea6af3eb658dade9da5c0fdc2d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Briannaking"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
