Follow your players' fitness, choose your captain, matchday squads and strategies, handle the transfer windows, and make sure that your players are always developing.</li><li><strong>Try taking a trip to\u00a0Little Sicily.</strong> Dealing with the mafia is risky, but the prospect of placing <strong>illegal bets</strong> on your upcoming match, <strong>bribing the F.A.</strong> to get suspensions wiped off or getting your hands on some stamina-enhancing <strong>doping</strong> might just get too tempting at times. And don't sweat it\u2014if you're not interested in this sort of stuff, you can just ignore the mafia and play the game as a regular football manager game.</li><li><strong>Handle different scenarios! </strong>Each game week starts with up to five\u00a0<strong>random scenarios</strong>, that will affect your club and often require you to make choices. A local schoolboy might collect money for your club by selling lemonade. Your stadium might host a talent show for local boy bands, resulting in a major loss of reputation. A local fast food joint might be interested in a sponsorship deal: will you rename your stadium to \"Haggis Hall\" in exchange for money and embarrassment?</li><li><strong>Get excited about your matches and go crazy with\u00a0that late winning goal!</strong> In the match center, you can enjoy all your club's matches live, compressed into 50 seconds of\u00a0exciting live commentary.

Edit all save files or resource files easily in notepad for even more flexibility.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c878692243d18ae3aa52f7504f70cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uncultured Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
