It's really easy, but it will be <strong>a torture for your mind</strong> to complete all levels of the game because the apparent simplicity of the game is in contradiction with the complexity of the level-design. Moreover, an important point in the gameplay is if you have multiple cubes, they move <strong>simultaneously</strong> !<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li><strong>Easy gameplay</strong>, just move cubes... that's it!<br/></li><li><strong>Simplistic but not repetitive</strong>, use different elements to achieve your goal: buttons, elevators, color swappers, teleporters...<br/></li><li>The game and menus have a <strong>clean look</strong> to not disturb your concentration.
