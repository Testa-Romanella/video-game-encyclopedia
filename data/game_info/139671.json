The countryside has experienced a major power outage, and it\u2019s up to you to re-wire the grid and restore power.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially a basic math puzzle combined with a \u201cpipes\u201d style grid. You install and remove power lines and resistor towers to make sure the houses get the correct amount of power.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse only. Select a tool using the bar at the bottom of the screen, click on the grid to place it. Click on an existing piece of hardware to remove it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make something simple and polished, or, as polished as a Comp entry can be. During my last LudumDare, I overshot and ended up producing little more than a tech demo with some minor humor. This time around I wanted to make sure I actually built something I could call a \u201cgame\u201d.</p>\n<p>It may not be the most imaginative or complex thing in the world, but it feels significantly more refined than my last entry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Untested in Firefox, please use a WebKit or Blink based browser for now. Chrome recommended.</p>\n<p>In some cases a power line can be placed in a three-way connection with two generators and a resistor. This often makes it look like the lines are leading to the resistor, but are actually ignoring it.</p>\n<p>Linking a resistor in a loop to another resistor causes a power drain and drops them both to 0.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>G</strong>ame written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\u00a0</li><li>Graphic work was done in Photoshop and processed through CodeKit 3.</li><li>Music was generated with WolframTones.\u00a0</li><li>Sound effects generated with Bfxr.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebcd1f90556da15998b9d008f3e57e86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brandon Diaz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
