{"id": 704078, "slug": "a-nosferatu-embrace", "name": "A Nosferatu Embrace", "name_original": "A Nosferatu Embrace", "description": "<p>A Nosferatu Embrace is a short visual novel (set in the World of Darkness universe) following the first few days after the accidental embrace of a Nosferatu in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. The embrace, the act of creating a new vampire, is no easy thing for a Nosferatu, as the body shifts and contorts to take on a new, monstrous form akin to Max Schreck\u2019s Count Orlok from Nosferatu (1922). The agonising pain of bone stretching out of place and a new, burning hunger from within is enough to drive any Nosferatu to do terrible things to ease the suffering. Will you give in to the Beast inside you, who calls on you to drain your victims dry? Or will you resist temptation and seek the path of humanity? Do monsters deserve to suffer? Or are they too, victims of a terrible and cruel fate? And how far will you go to take back what belongs to you? Plunged straight into the deep end of this strange new world, you will have to ask yourself these questions\u2026 but in the end, the strings of fate may have their own plans.</p>\n<p>This game was a solo project, created as a part of Vampire: The Masquerade game jam 2021.
