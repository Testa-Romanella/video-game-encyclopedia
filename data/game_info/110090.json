A naive idea of love.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROL SCHEME</strong></p>\n<p>- ARROWS/WASD = walk, talk, etc.<br/>[mouse is supported but not \"guaranteed\": if you use it, sometimes you will be forced to interact with arrows/wasd!]<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>SECRETS?!</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, the game contains some secrets! But how are you supposed to find them if everything seems so straight-forward? Maybe the solution is what you can see but is out of reach, or vice versa what you can reach but is... Invisible?</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game, and do not hesitate to contact me for suggestions, ideas, bug reports and/or \"hints\"!! :D &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86b55371c7531243441c628fea27f923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Illud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
