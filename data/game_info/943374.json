Seeing as there was a drought of game jams, and I had nothing to do in my holidays, I figured I'd join.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All in all, I think it went great, I managed to implement most of what I wanted to. I <em>really </em>needed to make a good game again as well, seeing as my last semi-successful game was Ruined, made for Metroidvania Month 17, therefore about half a year before this one, which is just too long.</p>\n<p>Finishing a game is a skill to be aware of, and I'm just glad everything worked out so well with this. <br/></p>\n<p>Big thanks to the jam's host, Falcon Nova, and of course:<br/></p>\r\nHave a nice week!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T23:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea294b118c2bfa6b3fa6e38effdf6fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kaeselord"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
