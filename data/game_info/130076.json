If you combine two or more adjacent (horizontal and vertical only) same numbers, the numbers will fuse within the last discarded one. If the value of the resulting fusion is equal to or greater than 128, this number will also disappear, freeing up even more space on the board.</p><p><strong>It may seem complicated, but it is very simple, take a look at the video and draw your conclusions :P</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Features</strong><br/>\u2022 does not require internet connection;<br/>\u2022 colorblind friendly game;<br/>\u2022 optional online leaderboard to challenge your friends (android only);<br/>\u2022 totally free, no in app purchases;</p><p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Music by Eric Matyas</strong><br/>www.soundimage.org<br/><strong>SFX by ViRiX Dreamcor</strong>e<br/>soundcloud.com/virix<br/><strong>Icons made by Freepics</strong><br/>http://www.freepik.com<br/><strong>Engine</strong><br/>Godot Game Engine<br/><strong>Programming / Game Design</strong><br/>Shin-NiL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162c5f79029ad72dbc662cc3d7ccd466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shin-NiL"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
