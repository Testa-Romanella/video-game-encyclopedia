It was released in Japan on April 14, 1999, and in North America on June 28, 1999. In it, the ball is a Pok\u00e9 Ball, and most of the objects on the table are Pok\u00e9mon-related.<br />\nLike any pinball game, the main objective is to get points, using the different modes of advances to score them at a higher rate. Pok\u00e9mon Pinball has a secondary objective hinted at by the tagline &quot;Gotta Catch &#39;em All,&quot; which is to collect all 151 Pok\u00e9mon to fill your Pok\u00e9dex. The Pok\u00e9dex is saved between individual games, so it can be built up over time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T19:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81fabb67d3b6b92d2c8d3f6456156bdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 17, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 24, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 46, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 47, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Jupiter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
