Sadly... we didn't get to everything we wanted to include (our schedules didn't allow for all of those 50 hours) and also had to rush our level creation process slightly. So we thought we'd give you an insight in what we planned but couldn't add:</p>\n<ul><li>Slimey Surface (slowing objects and the player)</li><li>Bounce Pad (allowing for huge jumps)</li><li>Additional use cases for all Tools</li><li>An DnD like artwork to the right (don't even ask what our original idea was)</li><li>Particle Effects for all kinds of Interactions</li><li>Background Music and Various Sounds</li><li>Tool Hold button for those times you don't want to swap Tools</li></ul>\n<p>WARNING! A few levels have\u00a0some problematic Boomerang throws, might need some tricky maneuvers to get it right. And in Level 1-5 the end can't be reached.\u00a0Sorry</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3ddc2d414b796a63f7a3bb4954055f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marvin Keller", "KapitaenLucky"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
