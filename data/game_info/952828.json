If I were to continue developing this project, I'd like to include more puzzle mechanics and rooms to explore. In this project's current state, however, it is only experimentation on horror-level design and audio implementation in Unreal Engine.</p><p>If you want to check out the blueprints, here's the link!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc7d0ec94e10acd7a009a04fbafcfa57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.Krafty"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
