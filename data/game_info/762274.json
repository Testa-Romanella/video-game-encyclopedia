Enjoy!</strong></p>\n<p>A man is stranded in deep space, with no memories except a sense of purpose: he needs to somehow find his way back home; throughout the journey he writes in a diary as he starts to remember, with the help of\u2026 someone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>We weren't able to make\u00a0all puzzles playable in time for the jam. We will update the game after voting ends. We hope you can enjoy the part of the game that is playable in the meantime &lt;3</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips for playing:</strong></p>\n<p>If you are stuck in a puzzle, you can press the \"H\" key to skip it! So that you can sample all the puzzles and play the full story ^-^\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art and UI: catamariii, Francesco Ruggero</p>\n<p>Music and\u00a0Sound design: DeoMusicl</p>\n<p>Programming: mtrovy</p>\n<p>Narrative and game design: Lidia Santoemma</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T14:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32e3bf148a78aa42eb7f5450222089e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team SolEtude", "Mari", "mtrovy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
