It will try to survive, build and thrive, whether or not you decide to intervene.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay:<br/>\r\nThe core gameplay involves observing the AI characters as they go about their day doing what they do, and watching as they turn the somewhat sparse and barren landscape into a more lively and developed environment. The player has the option to spawn more AI (gold dependent) to increase development speed. There is only one way to spawn gold resources, a gold platform underneath the gazebo. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures: <br/>\r\nCurrently implemented features include first-person movement using the WASD keys, Spacebar for jump, F key to fly, LeftShift to sprint, LeftCtrl to crouch, and E key to spawn AI characters.
