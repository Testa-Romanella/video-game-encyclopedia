I am writing my final qualification work in nanoelectronics and at the same time I am developing my game.</p>\n<p>Why did I create this theme? I want to share the development of my game, posting the result here in the form of a demo version and screenshots every 1-3 days. I create the game alone.</p>\n<p>Now a few words about the game. This is a 3D soulslike platformer with a side view and RPG elements. The plot is still in development.\u00a0Development is on unity.</p>\n<p>The start of the project is Monday, 03/29/2021. The topic will be constantly updated so subscribe and share your opinion, tips on the game, I will be glad to any feedback.</p>\n<p>Contact with me 13371337ddd@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Devlogs -\u00a0https://itch.io/t/1292238/devlogs-rpg-3d-platformer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a3d138afe54a01d090f6c7ae503b5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loki"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
