Pick all three at random and use what you got to survive 4 stages of siege from walking coins!</p>\n<p>You only get one shot, lose to the coins and start all the way back at the house's front door.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>X, Left MB, Right Trigger to shoot</li><li>AD, ARROW KEYS, GAME-PAD to walk</li><li>F for Full-screen (and to get out of it, hit F again)</li><li>Q to exit game</li><li>R to restart (in case you get stuck)</li></ul>\r\nHow I made this game\r\n<p>Monday, April 23rd:\u00a0Long story short, I\u00a0made this game for Ludum Dare 41. I started thinking of ideas, drawing on Friday night. Nothing. Saturday did more drawing well into the AM and still nothing. Sunday morning, got my idea and have been working on it non-stop since.</p>\n<p>Oh, added bonus, I used Game Maker Studio 2 to make this (never made a full game with it yet)\u00a0and it was a fun\u00a0additional challenge coming from\u00a0Construct!</p>\r\nThere are still bugs but...\u00a0\r\n<p>If you see any let me know and I will try and fix them.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>If you start with 1 ammo (or run out entirely)\u00a0hit 'R' to restart.</li><li>If you don't get the right bullet, or health.... sorry I need to redo that later</li><li>Will be adding more for the enemy AI later this week (right now all they do is walk, but don't let them touch you!)</li><li>Gamepad UP/DOWN with left analog jumps you (I could have sworn I limited this but will do that later :D)</li></ul>\r\nWhat's Next?\r\n<p>I\u00a0really wanna redo this. It took me so long to get an idea for the theme '2 incompatible genres' that I didn't spend time on gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Add better AI (that does more than just walk)</li><li>Berserker AI (blast of coins?)</li><li>Stealth Coin\u00a0AI (sneaky snek)</li><li>Gunman Coin\u00a0</li><li>And polish to the player (camera, shake, particles, bounce, knockback, etc.)</li></ul>\n<p>Basically, now that the jam is over, I can breath and make this into a true action game! Let me know what you think :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97f/97fce8a746334db92caabcc745b8e14f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jerementor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
