Their height is indicated by their color or rather their brightness.</p>\n<p>If a tower is places on the lowest level then they wont be able to shoot over platforms that are higher than itself. There are many different kinds of tower , but you will have to unlock them while you play. Luckily the progress of unlocking is saved . ( locally per browser &amp; device ...) <br/>All controls are done with the mouse !</p>\n<p>You can view stats of towers and enemies by clicking on \"info\" and then clicking on the thing you want info about. <br/>In much the same way can you delete Towers and edit them with the \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" option. <br/>Editing Towers is only their behavior as of now.</p>\n<p>The audio might be a little too loud, you can change the volume in the settings ( menu).<br/><br/>Have fun ! <br/>and be sure to comment any ideas you have for the game or problems you have discovered.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:41:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fb4b641f858e052b89b36373cffd52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jannik323"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
