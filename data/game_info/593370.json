The mighty kingdoms of Spain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies. And there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become the most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer or a Trader?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean. And of course, trade will have a less important role to play in your rise.\n<br/>\nThe way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing your riches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of the New World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and develop the economy of the colonies.\n<br/>\nOf course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you want, letting you create your own unique and exciting story.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not alone in the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean. The Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in beautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!\n<br/>Key Features:<ul><li>Two different single player campaigns: Adventurer and Trader \n<br/>\n</li><li>Naval battles, raids, plundering and invasions await the Adventurer, while the Trader will develop trade routes and the economy to earn glory, fortune and power \n<br/>\n</li><li>16 different ship types, such as powerful Galleons or versatile Frigates \n<br/>\n</li><li>Organize trade with 60 different cities such as Port-au-Prince or Tortuga\n<br/>\n</li><li>A competitive Multiplayer mode for up to 4 players \n<br/>\n</li><li>A comprehensive trade system, with supply and demand dynamically setting the price of goods and wares, like in the real world</li></ul>\n<br/>\nPort Royale 3: Dawn of Pirates DLC<br/>\nDawn of Pirates offers you a whole new singleplayer-campaign, in which you can make some trouble in the Caribbean as a pirate. You will start your raids from your own hideout but cities may be restricted to you. Your aim in Dawn of Pirates is to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean by raiding and plundering. Arrr, what are you waiting for? Set sail!\n\n\n<br/>\nPort Royale 3: Harbour Master DLC<br/>\nWith the Harbour Master DLC you can enhance Port Royale 3 with six completely new building types, several decoration objects for your cities and with an economic adviser, who will give you useful hints. In addition you will now have more control over the defense of your cities and you will be able to build ships on your own!\n\n<br/>\nPort Royale 3: New Adventures DLC<br/>\nEverybody who looks for new challenges should try the New Adventures DLC. Five new scenarios are waiting for you, each one with unique task that will let you experience unseen and thrilling situations. So you will help the city of Corpus Christi in \u201cThe Ascension of Christi\u201d to become rich and well-respected within a short time or you have to organize the biggest party the Caribbean has ever seen in \u201cThe Big Party\u201d. For that you have to get a huge amount of resources to the Florida Keys in a fairly short amount of time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T04:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d1bb8a8d3a0a7903a3e4859e2294e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 436, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaming Minds Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
