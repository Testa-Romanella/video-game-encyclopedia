Angry, he broke the shell of the sky and with every drop that touched it, the crack increased. We could feel the fate that awaited us at the grasps of evil spirits with each drop.</p>\n\n<p>I used to say that Thunderstorm was a curse. That our greed really brought us to an end... <br/></p>\n<p>But now... Now I realize clearly that He has stolen from us our greatest connection to each other. I have never felt so connected to my tribe as I do now... Because now, now everyone is free to go their own way.</p>\n<br/>Made by:Andr\u00e9 Amaro (@Andeidara)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Level Designer<br/>Andr\u00e9e Burlamaqui (@umdree_)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Programmer and Tech Artist<br/>Cody Woods (@cody_woods_)\u00a0 \u00a0- Soundtrack Composer<br/>Daniel Bertolucci (facebook.com/RedDotDubbing)\u00a0- Voice Acting<br/>Lucca de Souza (@luccadesouzart)\u00a0 \u00a0- 2D Artist and Animator<br/>Jos\u00e9 Victor Dias (@Zoldyako)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 2D Concept Artist and 2D Environment<br/>J\u00falia Rosa (upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01cd041fc9ea820a53) - Localization PT-BR to ENG-US", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc00de9d705583f58912d40657105f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucca de Souza", "Andr\u00e9e Burlamaqui"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
