I may or may not try and make a game with it at some point if I'm satisfied with its progress. So, the fact of the matter is,\u00a0have some fun while re-inventing the wheel.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keys</strong>Movement\r\nW\u00a0A\u00a0S\u00a0D\r\nFree-look\r\n\u2191\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2193\u00a0\u2190, or the mouse<strong>*</strong>\r\nChange elevation\r\nQ\u00a0E, or\u00a0<strong>*</strong>\n<p><em><strong>*</strong>\u00a0You should first click\u00a0\u00a0on the\u00a0canvas\u00a0to activate mouse controls.</em></p>\r\nLive Demo\r\n<p>You can check out the live demo\u00a0here!</p>\r\nTrivia\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The project is named after the fact that I'm too lazy to come up with an original name, so I make up a placeholder name to keep me going until the first-ever public release of the project, by which time I had already grown accustomed to the placeholder name and it's too late to come up with a new name, so I decide to go with it thinking I can\u00a0pretend it is a deliberate choice of a name so I can make some silly\u00a0<em>backronyms</em>\u00a0with it.</p>\r\nGitHub\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>tmp3d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e472d2146b20de017b3395b595cda422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["undefbehav"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
