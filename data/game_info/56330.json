He is armed with a club, with which he can hit and either stun or kill a variety of roaming creatures. These creatures include: cavewomen, who can be dragged back to the cave as \"wives\"; food with legs, which can be roasted on the fire and dragged back to the cave to feed the growing family; and dinosaurs, predators who will eat potential wives and food, and kill Bill on contact. Bill can also die from burning on the fire if he has no food, a broken heart if too many wives leave the cave, and starving to death if he is unable to feed his family.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/996631df808ce3c6c64092bed3d788f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Imagine Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
