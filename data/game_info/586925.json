{"id": 586925, "slug": "city-of-immortals", "name": "City of Immortals", "name_original": "City of Immortals", "description": "<p><em>\"Despite the shabbiness, it\u2019s proof that humans still exist, proof that, no matter the trial, you\u2019ll continue to live so long as there\u2019s hope, determination and, if you\u2019re being honest, spite.\"</em></p>\n<p>City of Immortals is a work in progress that follows a pair of siblings after the downfall of the last city in an isolated desert somewhere no one can name. Believing the other to be dead, the two must now struggle their way through their respective situations\u00a0and hope, somehow, they'll survive.<br/></p>\r\nSo what is City of Immortals?\r\n<p>Essentially it's a science-fiction interactive book masquerading as a western. It takes place in two very different locations in this strange world, following two similar characters who think everything and everyone they once lived for is gone. Gradually, the two worlds will collide and the two main characters will finally reunite, but at what cost?</p>\r\nWhy should I care?\r\n<p>Why? Well, other than getting this for no cost--albeit currently unfinished--there are a number of current and future features to the game.</p>\n<ul><li>Completely customizable main characters: You can choose their names, skills, personalities, genders, sexualities and, later, their appearances.</li><li>Not everyone is completely human, not even you. This may not be immediately evident.</li><li>Two separate stories in two separate locations across the mysterious world the characters inhabit. One is a desert wasteland, abandoned by time and whatever Gods may exist, the other is a sprawling underground city inhabited by, you guessed it, immortals.</li><li>Where one sibling sets out to solve a mystery of mass-disappearances, another joins a revolt against the decadent ruling class who have spent centuries experimenting on those weaker and less well-off.</li><li>12 (possibly 13 depending on popularity) diverse love interests. There are a collection of male, female, and non-binary characters for each mc, and some who will change depending on your choice. There is also a poly option! Be warned though, not all love interests are equally attracted to every mc!</li></ul>\r\nSo what exactly do you have right now?\r\n<p>Right now I have a prologue and half of chapter one, in which you get a feel for the first and youngest of the two main characters and their life. There is also a full save and load system, an autosave system,\u00a0 a settings screen that doesn't currently do anything but will soon, and two work in progress stats screens (so sorry if they visibly look like That).</p>\r\nIf I want to give feedback, where can I contact you?\r\n<p>Good question! First and foremost you have the comments on this particular post so that's somewhere to start, but if you really want me to see it you're much more likely to find me on my blog. Here, there is also additional content and another game that I'm currently converting to twine like this game is.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read through all this, and I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T07:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26baa2ff420405bd3f488be8e06ae2e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Rotten_games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
