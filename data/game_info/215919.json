I didn't realize until after posting that\u00a0the only scoring metric for this jam\u00a0was good design and the whole joke of the game is how horrible the actual game's\u00a0design is. I pretty much had only noticed\u00a0the theme and didn't pay attention to\u00a0everything else he said about what the jam was about.\u00a0It's fair to say I goofed up there but I'm glad people liked the jokes. As a wise sonic game once taught me, \"Live and learn\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>EDIT 2: And of course you can also rate the game low if you thought it was hot garbage.
