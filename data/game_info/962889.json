{"id": 962889, "slug": "village-monsters-2", "name": "Village & Monsters", "name_original": "Village & Monsters", "description": "Village &amp; Monsters is a card game that challenges you to develop a human settlement as well as viruses. The settlement is periodically attacked by monsters, but the monster population is held back by a virus. The goal of the game is to reach a population of 100 people and not let the virus die.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the plot of the game, it is assumed that when reaching 100 people, people themselves will be able to fight back the monsters, without the help of a virus. With the help of combinations of two different cards, you can develop your settlement. Cards are divided into: materials, technologies, weapons and tools, permanent (social), events. There are also 3 decks: accumulated, events and for permanent cards. For viruses, everything is the same, only in the way of viruses. For example, in humans, you have to keep track of food and population, and in viruses, for DNA and the number of viruses. A special role is played by buildings that produce food and materials (for viruses, instead of creature buildings). Buildings are also built using combinations of cards and are displayed on the game map, where you can see detailed information about each building. Creatures can adapt to the virus, which will reduce the production of DNA. The more viruses, the faster the creatures adapt. It is possible to infect people, which will give big buffs to DNA and other cooler cards, but people will have debuffs in the form of disease cards. In general, you need to maintain a balance in the number of viruses. Events always have a negative effect on population or food, but this can be reduced with weapons and tools. Permanent cards provide a permanent buff, but their deck is limited to four cards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T04:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1c3885c89f3ee64bbfbabd47148fee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ilya873"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
