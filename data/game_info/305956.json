{"id": 305956, "slug": "snoozle", "name": "Snoozle", "name_original": "Snoozle", "description": "Snoozle is an addictive puzzle game that is easy to learn but difficult to master!<br/><br/>Use the touchscreen to flick the balls to the top of the screen. Match 3 of the same color to clear them from the screen. Clear 10 to advance to the next level. Each new level adds a new colored ball.<br/><br/>When you clear a ball that has others attached to it, they drop away. Drop 10 to earn a swap - double-tap to change the current ball to whatever color you need!<br/><br/>Some reviews:<br/><br/>Since the app store opened, I've been looking for a game like Snood but without the unnecessary complexity and file size of Bubble Bash. This is it. Simply figure out where you want the ball to go and flick your finger to launch it up the screen. Line up three in a row of the same color and they clear. Easy and fun. - kcjazzlark<br/><br/>This game is so much fun to waste time and when your bored - Wggkfwc<br/><br/>Funnest game out right now - Gossennator<br/><br/>Like bouncy color-coded crack -  jennachristine", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba3011725b8716f3297fac409835bfc7.jpg", "website": "http://snoozle.tk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["STROVI"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["STROVI"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
