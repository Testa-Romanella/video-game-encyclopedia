It is built using Unreal Engine 4.<br />\nRight now there are 2 finished levels (that need some kind of polishing), and a semi-finished level, so the duration of the game is very small.<br />\nI\u00a0lost interest in making this as I\u00a0have virtually no feedback from others so I&#39;m releasing it here. If you like it and you want to support me, make a donation or post your feedback (negative feedback is welcome but be polite) and I&#39;ll be making more levels!<br />\nThe minimum price is $1. Pay what you want. The recommended price is $5, around a cup of coffee or two, but feel free to pay more\u00a0(or less, no problem there!)<br />\nThe game is using the default Unreal Engine 4 Assets, as I&#39;m no artist.<br />\nCurrently there is no audio, just some sounds for doors etc.<br />\nSystem Requirements:<br />\nRAM: 2GBHDD: 450MBOS: Windows 7 and newerGPU:\u00a0DirectX 11 capable card with 512MB VRAM and\u00a0SM4.0 support.Mouse &amp; Keyboard (obviously)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T05:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/774f81b667da1174f01ee35c7b1392d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.76, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 396, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 19}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 42, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 42, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dimitrisp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
