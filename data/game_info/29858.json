The final version will expand on the story/lore, and have more levels and gameplay elements.<h3>Design Pillars</h3><ul><li> Gameplay first - HYPERBLADE prioritizes gameplay over story. No long unskippable cutscenes to interrupt the flow of gameplay.<br/></li><li> Tough but fair - Players should feel challenged, but should never feel that they died unfairly.<br/></li><li> A sense of mastery - A player's skill should improve over time. The satisfaction of mastering a mechanic can be extremely satisfying.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f41d65f728dfea7dc6458099b342ebb.jpg", "website": "https://kava-soft.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wizbang", "Drop Games", "Kavasoft", "tiny planet games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Sports", "Racing", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Drop Games", "Kavasoft", "tiny planet games"], "esrb_rating": null}
