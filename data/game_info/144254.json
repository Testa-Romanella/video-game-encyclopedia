The experience however, focusses on the unnerving struggles that someone might have when they are camping out in the dead of the night. Centralising on sounds and lighting to replicate the sounds and atmosphere that I\u2019ve experienced when camping, that made me feel uncomfortable and scared. Some sounds that I featured were sounds of animals that are found out in the bush, for example I used some growling noises to replicate a sound of a koala that I heard while camping. These replicated sounds are used to induce fear. As a growling koala sounds threatening and formidable, I wanted to make the player feel as if they needed to get away from this sound, and to anticipate a possible attack from whatever animal may be lurking behind the trees within the bush.\u00a0 I\u2019d like the audience to feel how I felt when I was camping and needed to go to the bathroom in the dead of the night with nothing but toiler paper and a torch in hand to aid me. This scenario is what I\u2019ll be trying to replicate within my virtual environment. Where the goal is the bathroom and along the way the player has the opportunity to walk the path and encounters tents as refuge only to be denied that refuge from any shelter. Building this environment, I looked to existing games such as Slenderman, as the environment in that game is very similar to what I wanted to achieve. The darkness within Slenderman and the main illumination coming from a torch in your hand is replicated in my environment as the refuge places are the only places that are illuminated leaving everything else dark and foggy. I did this to allow the players to be able to see where they needed to go and to guide them in the right direction. Overall I wanted to achieve an environment that prompts the user to experience the fear that I had encountered when I was camping, allowing the user to be immersed in an environment that is dark, full of unrecognisable noises that unnerve the user and enabling them to feel even a little bit uncomfortable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e4abb9a0011ddd3ddefa01e11ada2e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["kctale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
