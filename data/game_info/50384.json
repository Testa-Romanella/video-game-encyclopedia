You were orphaned in early childhood, rescued and raised incognito by a mysterious Order of Dominican monks, so your loyalty lies with them and not the crown. Your skills at hiding empower you to brave missions others wouldn't dare and tonight is no exception. One of the Brothers from the order was arrested and will most likely face trial at dawn. SAVE HIM!  The Kings' spies are everywhere so run above the streets along the City wall. There are 7 gate towers to unlock on way to the Tower of London.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE WORLD<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Towers stretch and sprawl with their theme and have citizens going about their lives. Trust no-one and only run when you are out of their lines of sight, starting with Albone, a self-loathing jailer at Newgate. No Get Out Of Jail Free cards for his inmates, but you can leave that tragedy behind getting on to Aldersgate theatre next where the spotlight is on Stow and his labyrinth of props and toys. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe show must go on and Cripplegate hospital is next.  Few leave here alive (as you will see) and it's well meaning nurses suggest bed rest 'till you meet your Maker\u2019.  Mercy killing is recommended for extra points if you have time but it is running out and guards are already closing in on you. Next tower is Moorgate Inn where Miss Q breaks hearts and dices with her reputation. Play her games but don\u2019t let her catch you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you think that was Bedlam think again, Bishopsgate is next.  Dream or nightmare? That depends on you and if you wake up, the last wall tower is Aldgate Brewery where the lusty Belgian brothers pour out woes and count the money. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you come out of their maze alive a secret underground passage will be yours - the only way into the heart of the Tower of London where you hunt down Joseph somewhere amongst the ghosts, jewels, gold, armouries, a sleeping king and more.
