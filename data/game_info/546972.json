Fight for Honor and Glory and earn yourself a place on the scoreboard! You have much to gain! The best of the best will be remembered for all eternity.</p>\n<p>Wait up soldier! It appears that all of our systems are broken again...<br/>Ugh..<br/>It looks like there will be no fights for today.</p>\n<p>Unless of course someone is brave enough to try our different system settings without knowing what is wrong with them.</p>\n<p>They are suppose to adjust the different weapons in their Attackspeed, Projectiles and Damage. The Glatiators ability to move around and their vulnerability is also controlled by our settings.</p>\n<p>This is not good. WHO Knows what would happen if one would try them out before we can repair them.</p>\n<p>Their savety could not be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>We just have to wait and see what happens i guess.</p>\n<p>STORY END</p>\n<p>There are 5 Modes with different Settings\u00a0you can enter the arena in.</p>\n<ul><li>All Out (Where ALL Stats are broken and randomized even during gameplay)</li><li>Rapid Fire (Only the attack speed is broken and randomized)</li><li>Furiously\u00a0Fast (The movement speed and bullet speed is broken)</li><li>Healthy (The max health of you and enemies is broken and randomized)</li><li>Custom (ALL Stats are broken, but you can choose their base value yourself)</li></ul>\n<p>I personally struggled to implement\u00a0 the theme of the GameJam (\"Everything is Broken\") into a project, but figured out this solution. The theme is not very obviously woven into the game since it was implemented through the games mechanics and systems, but i hope you understand how i interpreted it.<br/><br/>I Hope you have fun playing\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yannick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T06:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12d63f47be5e67774c08ad3b8290c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YDenker"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
