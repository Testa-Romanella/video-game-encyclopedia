Footy Showdown also brings innovations that have never been seen in any Australian Football video game.<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>Footy Showdown will bring fun but realistic game play keeping true to Australian Football. Tackle, bump, mark, kick and handball your way to glory. Players will zone the field realistically: There will be players out of position, loose players to utilise in your attack, team mates will run in support for handball receives. Be tactical though, the path to goal isn't always straight through the corridor, take the wrong option and the opposing team could rebound all the way to goal.<h3>GRAPHICS</h3>Footy Showdown has charming pixel art graphics. This art style will stand the test of time like many before it though don't let it fool you, this game will employ advance pixel art techniques to bring you the best animations possible for the players.<h3>INNOVATIONS</h3>The game brings some innovations we have never seen in an Australian Football game to date.
