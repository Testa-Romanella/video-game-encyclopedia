You control a giant metal plate that can block what's incoming, use the mouse to move it.</p>\n<p>This game is based partly on memory and reflexes, whoever is shooting is luckily using laser sights, so you can see where they are aiming. Just before they shoot, the laser expands slightly, giving you a short warning, where to focus. That is the reflex part, the memory comes in if you remember what order the lasers turn on, that is the same order they will shoot.</p>\n<p>The game has 20 levels, can you protect the town for that long?</p>\n<p>This game was made for Ludum Dare 46.</p>\n<p><strong>Programs:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2019.3.8f1</li><li>Visual Studio Community 2017</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Paint.net</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Universal Sound FX Pack by Imphenzia</li><li>Responsive WebGL Template by SIMMER.io</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e23931ba1b33b1a450abab227f4428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZenriS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
