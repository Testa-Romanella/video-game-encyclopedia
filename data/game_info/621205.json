You can use this to spin the two through the level and squeeze through tiny gaps. It's important to keep track of which side is up, the red bar indicates the top of the players, but it's still easy to confuse your left and right if you're not careful.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/720b9d610e7e2669e54a0d0d8b2a8c60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LindyGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
