As a result of all these experiments, he gains electro-magnetism powers by accident. He unleashes himself from the cage and goes into the rat holes in the wall in order to escape from the laboratory. With his new power, he can connect boxes to one another and uses this to escape and get his freedom.\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Creators ;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Program &amp; Level Design:\u00a0Kerim ZENG\u0130N\u00a0</p>\n<p>SFX &amp; Music\u00a0:\u00a0Batuhan \u015eAYER</p>\n<p>\r\nAnimation &amp; PixelArt:\u00a0G\u00f6kalp CO\u015eKUNTUNA\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls ;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Movement and Jump : Arrow Keys\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Melee magnet : E\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Ranged magnet : Q\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Boxes\u00a0<strong>;</strong>\n</p>\n<em>A common box with no special abilities.
