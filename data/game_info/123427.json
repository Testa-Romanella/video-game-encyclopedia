She felt like it's time to show those devils what real music\u00a0sounds like... for the last time in their lives!\u00a0Bloody Mary annihilates the crowd with Fire On The Dancefloor Cat and\u00a0Terror Shoot Gun, and it's our very unexpected mission to evacuate\u00a0the crowd. Use the Event Security Guards to redirect metalheads away\u00a0from the main entrance (a.k.a.
