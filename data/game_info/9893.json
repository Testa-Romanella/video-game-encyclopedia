{"id": 9893, "slug": "life-is-hard", "name": "Life is Hard", "name_original": "Life is Hard", "description": "<strong>\"Life is hard\"</strong> is a strategy/village management game. Your aim here is to control a tribe. Defend your village, harvest resources, expand your town, colonize the islands, upgrade your tools and weapons and contact with other civilizations. There is no specific aim in our game. You can do whatever you want.<br/><br/><strong>Expand your village:</strong> build farms and houses, upgrade tools in blacksmith, trade with your neighbors. It\u2019s your destiny to create the most powerful town in this amazing world!<br/><br/><strong>Conquer the world by fire &amp; sword or with power of diplomacy.</strong> What would you choose \u2013 to help your neighbors to deal with the Vikings for iron ore or to rob them to get more? To pay the Normans tribute or to refuse, condemning your nation to war? To trade with the caravan or to loot it? Make your choice, but remember: every medal has its reverse...<br/><br/><strong>Prove that your civilization is the most cultured by building the Wonder of the World!</strong> You have to put many resources in that project. But it\u2019s worth it, isn\u2019t it?<br/><br/><strong>Whatever you choose, your path won\u2019t be easy.</strong> Your plans can be ruined by one of many random events. But it\u2019s no need to get upset! In the moments of crisis there come those, who are the only support of justice. Those, who are ready to lead people into the thick of battle. Heroes \u2013 braves, who are lead by you and ready to support people in need. They are ready to die for their ideas. Every one of them has unique talents that can help you in different situations.<br/><br/><strong>The belief of your people is strong not only in heroes, but in the God. Choose your patron, but be careful: that choice will affect the whole game.</strong> Pray your god and he\u2019ll give you talent of a trader. Or, maybe, the forest itself will raise against your enemies? Will he reveal the secrets of construction and craft to you? It\u2019s your choice. Choose wise, because life of the whole nation is on you!<br/><br/>Remember that <strong>life is hard</strong>. <strong>Whatever you choose, remember, you path will be thorny.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a5922c56bb4b8b7e87ed95f0c05f13.jpg", "website": "https://lih-game.net/indexEn.html", "rating": 2.6, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 201, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pirozhok Studio", "Vitaliy Ruzankin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pirozhok"], "esrb_rating": null}
