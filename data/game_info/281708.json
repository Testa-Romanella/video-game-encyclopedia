So he is now going to try and climb a tall tree so that he can watch the match from outside the stadium and enjoy the world cup.<br/><br/>Description:<br/>                    Cricket Jump is a simple game in which you have to tap the screen to get the bug jump on the tree branches and get as high as possible before the time runs out. Tap on either side of the screen to dash in that direction. Every time you climb a branch, time is added to the timer allowing you to play for a bit longer. The faster you climb the more time you have. But be careful not to jump on the bad branches with spikes on them. They are hardly visible but they are deadly. You can share your score with your friends and compare it in the leader board and try to unlock all the achievements. There are 2 leader boards naming Score(\"points\") and Out(\"death count\").<br/><br/>Features : <br/>- Beautiful 2D Graphics<br/>- Pleasing environment <br/>- Single Touch Controls<br/>- Intuitive and easy game play<br/>- Game Centre leader board<br/>- Awesome 8 bit Music by Erick Skiff<br/>- Multi Platform", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd80f7097bcf416ac8632c0851e99898.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/BringitOnFreeApps", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Uzair Mehmood"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["Uzair Mehmood"], "esrb_rating": null}
