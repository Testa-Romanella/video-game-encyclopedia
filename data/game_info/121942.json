Vegaview is proud to have Marcus and Gerardo join us to make this game happen. We got a little over-ambitious, and many things changed since the original concept, but it's playable, and there's a story, and that's all we could hope for. Definitely a great base for a more polished title that would be worth expanding upon. Voidshift places players in the role of a soldier scavenging the wastes of a city that was once great, in search of supplies that could help their group survive against terrible creatures and an unforgiving apocalypse. Adding to the never-ending struggle is a vendetta against a great beast, the Archangel of The Maw who wiped out your family before your eyes, leaving you the only survivor. Will you last long enough to make it through the city, secure supplies, and exact revenge? Better save those bullets cause once you cross the threshold of the void, there's no turning back, and vengeance is the only option..</p><p>Controls are in the main menu, don't forget to grab your gun and lead pipe before you venture into the city..</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ced0b75432048705ae729ed07c78b95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thenegaverse"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
