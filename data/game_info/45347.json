They can be collected by playing cards with Empire-Points from your Hand into your<br/>Empire on the board.<br/><br/>If the Empire-Value (the value in the blue shield!) of a player is 50 or more points, this player is about to win.<br/>He will win if the opponent cannot catch up within the next 2 rounds!<br/><br/><strong>GAME START</strong>The game starts with the flip of a dime.<br/>The winner will choose its King of Darkness first and play first!<br/>The opponent will therefore select his King from the remaining ones.<br/>Each player starts with a start-deck of 10 cards: The chosen King and 9 Mercenaries!<br/><br/><strong>THE MARKET-PLACE</strong>You could buy new and better cards from the Market-Place with the gulden-values from your cards by playing them from your Hand for acquiring.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As the game starts, the Market-Place is built out of the cards from both selected factions.<br/>The two leftmost cards are your private-deck and consists of vampire- &amp; realm-cards which are under the spell of your selected king, therefore only you can acquire those cards!<br/>The two rightmost cards are the private-deck of your opponent. Only he can buy those cards.<br/>However with spell-cards you can banish cards also from your opponent\u2019s private cards.<br/><br/>The three cards in the middle of the Market-Place are available to both players, those are the location- &amp; spell-cards from both factions.<br/>This means that each king-duel combination provides a fresh and unique collection of cards, which offers different tactical and strategic challenges and possibilities each game.<br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of the game and at the end of each turn both players draw 5 cards from their Deck. In the very first round the player in second place draws 6 cards!<br/><br/>If your newly drawn Hand does not have enough guldens to buy a card, you can recruit additional Mercenaries in order to be able to buy the cheapest or even the most expensive card from the Market-Place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Be aware of the Mercenary-Limit. At the beginning of the game you can only \u201cEmpire\u201d one Mercenary per turn.<br/>Each completed group however increases this limit by one!<br/><br/>Before the cards for the next turn are being drawn from the player\u2019s Deck, all played cards (except the \u201cheld\u201d ones) go back into the players Discard-Pile.<br/><br/>This means that played cards will stay in the game and will appear again later because if the Deck is empty the Discard-Pile will be shuffled and becomes the new Deck.<br/>This is not true for cards which were played into the Empire or cards which have gone into the Graveyard!<br/> <br/>During your turn, you can:<br/><br/><ul><li>Play cards from your Hand for acquiring new cards from the Market-Place<br/></li><li>Play cards from your Hand into your Empire to increase your power<br/></li><li>Play location-cards from your Hand into your Empire for permanent guldens and holding-ability<br/></li><li>Play spell-cards from your Hand for immediate effects<br/></li><li>Play power-cards and surprise your opponent<br/></li><li>Hold cards until the next turn</li></ul><strong>HISTORY &amp; DARK TIME-TRAVELERS</strong>All cards in the game belong to one of four specific factions.<br/>This means that each card is under the powerful spell of one King of Darkness.<br/>Each King controls the affiliates of his specific time-period, meaning just he can acquire them!<br/><br/>But you guess very right, the mighty habsburg rulers are just bound to their king \u2013 by no means are they bound to a specific time \u2013 they could be seen as dark &amp; ancient travelers of time, appearing all at the same time \u2013 again, but bloodier then ever\u2026<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game the player can select his king resp. his faction!<br/>Therefore, both players have their own private-deck available for acquiring at the Market-Place exclusively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>They have been known throughout the centuries as the lords and ladies of Habsburg. European high-born.<br/>Influencers of men, manipulating the very fabric of human society across the four corners of the Earth.<br/>Sometimes for the good, sometimes for the detriment\u2026 always to their own ends.<br/>In time, as man and the world evolved, their dynasty, like all dynasties before it, dwindled as the last<br/>vermillion rays of the setting sun.<br/>But even as the lords of Habsburg seceded power in the early 20th century and slipped into a slumber far<br/>removed from the public eye, their name and influence remained.<br/>A peculiar, unrelenting resilience.<br/>One that\u2019s led me to my exhaustive studies for over twenty years academic pursuit which reveals a terrifying truth\u2026<br/>The lords of Habsburg are immortal.<br/>Nonhuman stewards of the secret of blood-the knowledge of its memory and power, and the dark magic to wield it.<br/>They are creatures of the night<br/>Nosferatu.<br/>Izcacus.<br/>Vampyr.<br/>And their sleep is over.<br/>Four lords of Habsburg have returned from the grave, intent on rebuilding their once great empire.<br/>By sheer luck, or perhaps divine will, they return in disaccord.<br/>Recalling the power from four distinct eras of history, each lord seeks to rebuild the empire in their own image.<br/>They beckon forth kin of old to sit beside them, and use blood secrets from battles and events of days remembered.<br/>I fear they will stop at nothing to attain their desires.<br/>With God\u2019s grace, they will destroy themselves in the process.<br/>If not, I pray the world will believe my journals and witness the truth behind\u2026<br/>VEmpire: The Kings Of Darkness.<br/><br/>\u2013 Jakob, The Chronicler  \u20183 October<br/><br/>The history of the Hapsburg dynasty is the inspiration for our extraordinary theme.<br/>Our artists did an amazing job in turning mighty rulers into terrific vampires. Our cards are subtle interpretations<br/>of historical characters, places and events.<br/><br/>We love to look at VEmpire as an atmospheric blend of game-mechanics, artwork, story and music.<br/>Hopefully you will enjoy this experience as much as we do!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/1751cdbdca67650e2c92b2d3f87adb13.jpg", "website": "http://vempiregame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Wolfgang Lueger"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Card", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vempire Entertainment", "Wolfgang Lueger"], "esrb_rating": null}
