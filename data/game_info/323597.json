The game will be fully in 3-D and first person, with the character playing a game of poker at a table with robotic opposition. The robots will have a number of hidden values determining their ability to hide their tells as well as their ability to bluff on their hand. In addition, as the name suggests, the robots will do everything they can to cheat. From taking extra cards, to having an ace up their robo-sleeves. It'll be up to a sharp eyed player to call them out.</p>\n<p>Still in progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T05:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/6575932f925aa7fca22cfc2e1cfb690a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Burlin-Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
