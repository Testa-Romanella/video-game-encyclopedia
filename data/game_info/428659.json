It seems you are a very clumsy astronaut that activated the defence system of a nearby planet, they think you are their enemy! How long would you be able to survive?<br/><br/>It seems to me that... this will not go well...<h3>THE GAME CONTROLS</h3><br/>Use the mouse to move the mouse in the menus (duh) and use the left button to click a button (double duh).

If using gamepad, press 'START'.<h3>THE GOAL AND HOW TO PLAY</h3><br/>The goal of this game is simple. You are the spaceship. You have to avoid missiles and make then collide against each other or the terrain to win points and money. The more points you make, the better. The more time you survive, the easier it will be to make more points, but more difficult to avoid missiles will appear.<br/><br/>A white circle surrounds the spaceship. It indicates the 'Danger zone'. If a hazard is within the 'Danger zone', time is slowed down until there are no hazards inside it. The hazards are the missiles and the terrain.<br/><br/>Use the shop to acquire improvements for your spaceship so it is easier to avoid the missiles. You can also equip a different powerup and improve them. In the shop you may also acquires different spaceship which add a small buff to your current improvements.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T04:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92d22e84d62945ee633490b0f57b0f23.jpg", "website": "http://gurilawaregames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gurila Ware Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gurila Ware Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
