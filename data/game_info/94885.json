Unfortunately, you're the only SpaceTrain Engineer on duty right now, so it's up to you to move whatever each station needs moved to whatever other station. The problem? Each piece of cargo must be delivered within an arbitrary time limit, or your pay gets docked! The quartermasters are playing games with you, but like any good engineer, you knock off at the end of your shift, no matter the state of affairs.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCollect your bonuses and try not to have your pay docked too much in this first-person space train game!\r\n</p><p>Pass through stations to deposit/collect cars. Delivering cargo on time rewards you the value of the cargo, while delivering it past the due time will result in that value being subtracted. No cargo can be delivered once your shift is over.<br/></p>\r\n\tCredits:\r\n\r\n\tDesign and Development\r\n<p>\r\n\tSean Mansell (@arknano)</p><br/>Models<p>Lite Black (@JB_LiteBlack)<br/></p><p>https://sketchfab.com/lite</p><br/>Music<p>Andrew Bell (@andybellmusic)<br/></p><p>www.andrewbellmusic.com</p><p>Skybox generated using @wwwtyro's Space Skybox Generator<br/></p><p>\r\n\tKnown Issues:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Cargo list breaks and shows invalid cargo</li>\n<li>No sound effects (the music is great though!)</li>\n<li>Controls are a bit wonky...
