To go to work or to call in sick and to have couple of beers? Our hero knows it all too well. Every morning he fights with himself to decide what to do.\u00a0<br/>You have a unique opportunity to witness (and to participate) in an internal fight, that takes form of slap competition for some reason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay:<br/>2 players act in a turn base fashion. <br/>On your turn, you have couple of seconds to charge a slap and to select a direction (if the time ends before you selected direction - you've missed your turn). <br/>After a direction is selected, it will be then displayed and the second player will have a limited time to react. <br/>If he presses the same direction - the slap is dodged. Opposite direction - receives double damage. Any other direction - regular damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Player Controls: <br/>Up = W <br/>Down = S <br/>Left = A <br/>Right = D <br/>Charge = G\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right Player Controls: <br/>Up = Up Arrow <br/>Down = Down Arrow <br/>Left = Left Arrow <br/>Right = Right Arrow <br/>Charge = M</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42e6536ee33c5280a23afb9701419536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["migs-atomic"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
