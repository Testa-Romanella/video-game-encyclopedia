You play as the Hammer Head of a Snuppy (snail-puppy) ranch. Summon your Buddies to sprint, sneak, and bulldoze their way to your opponent's ranch, and steal their Snuppies!</p>\n<p>Players have a suite of 4 cards that refilll every turn. At the start of a turn, players can use their cards to summon Buddies to the play field, empower their hammer, or cast spells. Once a player is done using cards, they sling their hammer to knock out their opponent's Buddies and save their own Snuppies from being rustled.</p>\n<p>The game has both single-player (against an AI) and multiplayer modes, as well as private matches, should you wish to challenge a friend to a Snuppy Rustlin' duel.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Butterscotch team and Michael Ha, our guest artist, for all their creativity this weekend. And a huge thanks to Shenanijammers across the world for a weekend we won't soon forget!</p>\n<p>Check out our podcast in the coming weeks to hear more about the Shenanijam and our thoughts on the games produced!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5cbcd317e0b4e2193285f907a677541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Butterscotch Shenanigans"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
