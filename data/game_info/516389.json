Every day we see our neighbors, friends or even family giving their trust to the false prophets. For free. You can\u2019t even blame them. But you can\u2019t blame the power hungry people either. It\u2019s the information middlemen without honor who are guilty of bending the reality.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>We show this in an aesopian styled fable about a (power) hungry wolf and a town of naive sheep. But nor the wolf or the sheeple can influence the town\u2019s election by themselves. The only one who can affect the faith of this peaceful town is our main character - newbie sheep journalist Shaun.</strong></p><p><strong>Game design, texts:</strong>\u00a0Adam Cintula,\u00a0Luk\u00e1\u0161 Voltem\u00e1r<br/><strong>Artist, Animator, Enviroment:</strong>\u00a0Dominik Herceg<br/><strong>Music &amp; Sounds:</strong>\u00a0Jaroslav Pato\u010dka .II<br/><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0Jaroslav Pato\u010dka .III</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T02:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca4/ca49838ac54971b371a12540237c40e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OLE-GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
