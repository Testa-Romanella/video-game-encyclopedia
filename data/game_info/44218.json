Swap the hexes just in time to catch stars of the same color, and fill up the grid to complete the level. Sounds easy at first, but later on increasingly complex star patterns emerge, and the hex grid gets larger as you work on harder planets. Your goal is to finish constructing the solar system by building each planet, accomplished by beating each level. <br/><ul><li>36 levels<br/></li><li>6 upgrades<br/></li><li>5 planets, 1 hidden<br/></li><li>2-3 hours of gameplay<br/></li><li>Windows/Mac/Linux works well with touch screens</li></ul><br/>Mechanics, Hexes, and Stars:<br/><ul><li>Click to swap hexes and catch stars of the same color and fill them up.
