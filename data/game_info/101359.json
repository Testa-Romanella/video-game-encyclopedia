All they can do is wait for the rescue team to come. As the individuals are growing more and more desperate over time, you'll be able to grow closer to them and discover their stories.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Agathe</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAgathe, 28, retired army officer. She's the heroine of the story and has trouble staying calm underground. Has many skeletons in her closet and would rather not think about it.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Aline</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAline, retired 73 years old and still kicking. Despite her age, she's bubbly, dynamic and like to get straight to the point.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Gabriel</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGabriel, 19, student. He has a rather cynical side and makes a lot of snarky comments but he's a good guy at heart, though a bit antisocial at times.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Eleesha</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEleesha, 32, juggling with many different jobs like cashier or cleaner to make ends meet. Can't help but sigh thinking of the work she'll have to do after getting out.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Hassan</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe son of Eleesha who doesn't seem to speak at all. Since it's difficult to know what he thinks, some people tend to treat him as a dumb child\u2026which is a big mistake!\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>Dave</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDave, 47, director of a department team of the local public-service corporation.
