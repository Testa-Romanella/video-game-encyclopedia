It is a slow-paced pure walking simulator; you only walk, slowly, in the wilderness away from civilization. A beautiful poem from Archibald Lampman accompanies your short journey, and the original music score is composed by P\u0131nar Karaba\u015f.</p>\n<p>The game has 2 chapters. While the first one is a little linear, the second one (which is more expansive) takes place in a large open area. There are paths for the player to follow to reduce confusion about where to go. But you are free to roam away from the path and discover.</p>\n<p>PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who most seek to experience the mood.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T22:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efc75f1cd4eacacbf24ba2d82ef3851d.jpg", "website": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432750/Chionophile/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "esrb_rating": null}
