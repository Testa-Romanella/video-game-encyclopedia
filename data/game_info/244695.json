Dr. Eggman is causing trouble once again, and it&#39;s up to Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to stop him. Experience faster action, all-new two-player games, and a branching storyline that lets you choose to save the world as the Hero side, or conquer it as the Dark side. In the single-player mode, you&#39;ll go through more than 30 unique stages, which include a forgotten pyramid, an abandoned military base, and a giant space station. And then there&#39;s the expanded two-player mode, which features 12 playable characters competing in new head-to-head games.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2001-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-13T08:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/abd/abd245790a950e04830c7f1d54dfecf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.15, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 20, "beaten": 55, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "GameCube"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
