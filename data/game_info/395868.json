As I get better at creating games, I may come back to this and completely renovate it into a feasible game. This is my first attempt at making a 3D FPS game.</p>\n<p>Also this project is 100+mb until I figure out how to reduce file sizes, cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fcb7cd7f2a21ed3f70162c3403cf6a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["plaguedriver"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
