In the game, you start playing as a human and must shoot zombies that are spawning around the map. When your health reaches 0 however the player does but the game doesn't end. you\u00a0turn into a zombie and can continue to play but instead of against zombies, you're against humans. Your primary objective is to see how many zombie heads (collected when fighting zombies) and human brains (collected when fighting humans)\u00a0you can collect before you lose by finally dying (after reaching zero health as a zombie).</p>\n<p><strong>Going to play the game or have already played the game?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't mind I have created a google form for feedback.
