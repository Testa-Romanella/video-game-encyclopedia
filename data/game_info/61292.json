It is meant as a thin-mint of an interesting story, not a massive game.<br/><br/>Is it niche? Yes. Might this game not be for you? Maybe.<br/><br/>But for those who love unraveling mysteries, I hope you are up for a challenge or two.SpoilersSince this game is a murder mystery, we politely ask all streamers and YouTubers to either not reveal who the killer is in each case, or at least let your audience know that there are spoilers ahead.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/3224b4772458268bb1afe62ba173aab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 96}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LizardFactory"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LizardFactory"], "esrb_rating": null}
