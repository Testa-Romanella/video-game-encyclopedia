I cannot believe my ears! After countless years, I can speak to you!\r\n\n<p>Near the end of\u00a0<em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Heathcliff suddenly has a shift in his character\u2014he gives up on his quest for vengeance and begins a fasting strike.\u00a0 As a reader, this was a bit puzzling to me: why would he suddenly choose to starve himself instead of continuing his brutal treatment towards his enemies and their children? To answer this question, I wrote a side story about what happened during the night that Heathcliff hastily left the Heights to take a walk.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>A Night on the Moors\u00a0</em>is a narrative video game with some platforming elements. The player takes on Heathcliff's perspective and roams an open area while searching for quest items that shape the trajectory of the plot.\u00a0It uses a low-poly / surreal art style to reflect Heathcliff's descent into madness near the end of the novel. It also features 2 possible endings: one which aligns with the events in the story, and one which is more sinister...</p>\n<p>The game\u00a0was developed in Unity and C#\u00a0as a culminating project for my Grade 12 English class.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T04:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b443e04025c883a30df4bef2b059ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinLin905"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
