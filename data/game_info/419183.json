No real money is wagered or earned; all credits are simply representative numbers for fun. By pressing R to restart or entering the settings menu, your credits will reset to 500.</p>Gameplay<p>In\u00a0<em>Bandito Poker</em>, you are dealt 2 cards face-up, while the dealer is dealt 5 cards, 3 face-down and 2 face-up. You then\u00a0<em>steal</em> any one of the dealer's 5 cards, removing it from the dealer's hand and adding to your hand, offering a unique video poker strategy for players to engage, balancing harming the dealer's hand and improving your own. Your handcrafted three-card poker hand is then compared to the dealer's best three-card poker hand, and if you beat the dealer's hand, you win odds according to the paytable in the upper-left corner. This culminates with a Royal Tie, achieved when both you and the dealer have a Mini Royal (suited A-K-Q), which pays a progressive on a max credit bet.</p><p>Concurrently, a 7 card bonus game is run based on all 7 cards on the field at the end of a game. This pays odds based on the five-card poker hand formed from the 7 face-up cards, up to a 7 Card Straight Flush, which pays a progressive on a max credit bet. This progressive is separate from the main game's Royal Tie progressive.</p>Math<p>In this version, the main game has a house advantage of approximately 1.88% and the bonus game has a house advantage of\u00a02.787%. The main has a volatility\u00a0index (or standard deviation) of approximately 2.756.</p><p>For more information on the math of the game, please reference my simulation and Excel sheet for this game's math:\u00a0https://gunnar-clovis.itch.io/bandito-poker-math-simulation</p>Patent Warning\r\n<p>This demo of\u00a0Bandito Poker has been released for purposes of demonstration, fun, and education.
