They will mainly focus on chopping the trees down. Once you do get their attention, they will chase you down. If their path is blocked on the way to you, they will temporarily stop to cut the trees in their way.</p>\n<p>You have two types of \u201ccurrency\u201d: mana, and acorns. Acorns are gathered from fallen enemies, and will allow you to upgrade your existing abilities. If the acorns are left unused in the inventory, you will be gaining increased movement speed. The mana, along with the health of the player, is regenerated automatically. The more trees alive, the quicker the regeneration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d1354cdf6ec5437994d6d44d37d41e57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hakohn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
