With the rise of mobile devices and AR/VR capabilities, many real estate companies are now offering immersive house hunting experiences through AR apps. These apps enable potential buyers to visualize homes and properties in 3D, helping them to make informed decisions about which properties to visit in person. However, with the increasing competition in the real estate market, it is important to stand out by providing a unique and engaging house hunting experience. This is where gamification comes into play.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gamification is the use of game-like elements in non-game contexts, and it has been proven to be an effective tool for engagement and motivation. By applying gamification to the house hunting experience, real estate companies can make the process more fun and interactive, while also providing valuable information to potential buyers. For example, by creating challenges and rewards for users, they can encourage them to explore more properties and engage with the app for longer periods of time. In addition, gamification can help to create a sense of competition among users, which can further drive engagement and interest.\r\n</p>\n<p>In response to these trends, \"Discovering Your Dream Home in AR &amp; Gamification: An Immersive House Hunting Experience\" has been developed as an innovative solution to help real estate companies create a more engaging and interactive house hunting experience. By combining AR technology with gamification, users can immerse themselves in a virtual world where they can explore properties, complete challenges, and earn rewards. With this app, potential buyers can easily visualize their dream homes in 3D, while also having fun and being motivated to explore more properties. This app provides a unique and enjoyable experience for users, while also helping real estate companies stand out in an increasingly competitive market.\r\n</p>\n<p>github :\u00a0https://github.com/aditprasetio/project-fga</p>\n<p>ppt :\u00a0https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sfa6cX3aBIntV7LRlfB_8jOdr0VZay_T_1s9UIxn...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T21:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/0755c2b519c5aff2b495fd44990196d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aditpras"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
