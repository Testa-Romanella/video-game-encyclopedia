Destroying an enemy would immediately refill your teleportation bar so you could get a chain going or something. I also had planned out a boss that you had to beat with carefully timed teleports too. <br/>Hopefully I can put them in if I have the time after the jam.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Oops I unfortunately fell into the trap of including controller inputs for the game and not for the menus. Slapped myself on the wrist for that one.</em></p>\n<p><em>I also am aware of a couple of bugs, where the jump height of the astronaut stays low directly after a teleport for a few seconds longer than I originally planned. It resets but it does mean that if you are jumping right after teleporting the jump is weak.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also there is some kind of tile error on the browser version in one of the sets of two spike balls meaning the astronaut gets stopped as if he has walked into a wall. You can get over it if you jump but its still annoying and can cause you to take damage.<br/></em></p>\n<p>Created by Circumpunk-KKB in Unity</p>\n<p>Resource List:</p><p>Available from the Unity Asset Store:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Playmaker by Hutong Games</li><li>Corgi Engine by More Mountains</li><li>Remake - Stylized Swamp Mega Art Pack by EmacEArt</li><li>Effect textures and prefabs by Magicpot Inc</li><li>Shoot\u00b4em up Enemy Spikeball by VIS Games</li><li>Unique Toon Projectiles Vol. 1 by Gabriel Aguiar Prod</li><li>Magic Effects Pack 1 by kripto289</li><li>LowPoly Environment Pack by k0rveen</li><li>Polygon Sci-fi Space by Synty Studios</li><li>Skybox add-on by Eclypso</li></ul>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<ul><li>\"Absolute Space &amp; Sci-Fi Music \" Free Sample by Voltz Supreme</li><li>FREE Casual Game SFX Pack by Dustyroom</li><li>Various sound effects by krotosaudio</li><li>Various sound effects by DarkFantasyStudio</li></ul>\n<p>Models available from Sketchfab under Creative Commons Attribution</p>\n<ul><li>Alien by Akshat</li><li>Character .
