I don't know exactly what the goal of the game will be, but for now I have a prototype for that involves jumping on bubbles.</p>\n<p>You can't win or lose, only jump on bubbles. If you float to the top the bubbles will pop and you'll fall down. If you fall off the bottom of the screen you'll float back up on a new bubble.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music by Gruber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf9be65e1da6ca96a163309710ce3321.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Thompson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
