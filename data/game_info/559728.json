If you have java installed you can navigate into the bin folder inside runtime folder to run the conwaysJar.jar and that doesn't have any window loading issues. I'm really not sure why the exe is slow to open the window compared to the jar because they are the exact same application.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db41020dea31083b34d4cb9189839e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneEgg42"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
