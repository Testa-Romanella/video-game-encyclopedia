Enemies are varied and tough and there are plenty of secrets to uncover. The world is deep, rich and ready to explore. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This world was once full of adventurers. They were bright, vibrant and strong, running over fields, through caves, and across the arctic tundra, questing for glory and immeasurable bounty. Now these lands lay barren, crawling with beasts and fiends. The terrible warlock Drasorin slew the great heroes and unleashed his minions upon your home. Those that remain live sheltered lives, terrified of the day when Drasorin comes to claim them as well. <br/>It is up to you, to avenge your home and restore order. Using a sword left to you by the greatest of the adventurers, you must follow the footsteps of your dead heroes. You\u2019ll face endless peril with few safe havens, and fewer friends, to be found. You\u2019ll fight seas of foes and overcome great obstacles to bring justice to the doorstep of the fiend Drasorin. <br/><br/>The poets of triumph, glory, and legend are ready\u2026 are you?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> xInput controller support<br/><br/> Steam Achievements<br/><br/> Four unique zones<br/><br/> Tons of challenges<br/><br/> Buttery smooth platforming<br/><br/> Upgradable Weapons<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T04:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e23557fd17faed1e953541d5cb47e9ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kei Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Kei Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
