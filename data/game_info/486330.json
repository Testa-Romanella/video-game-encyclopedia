The soldier can attack with his sword as fast as you can move your mouse, but cannot harm ghosts. The wizard cannot directly attack but can illuminate the area with his light and can trigger a surge of light that kills ghosts and stuns other enemies, but has a lengthy cooldown. Use both of their tools to survive the onslaught until morning!</p>\n<p>Made for Miz\u00a0Jam 1</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Code/Design: Eggsquisite</p>\n<p>Art: Obtained from\u00a0Kenney's Assets</p>\n<p>Music: Obtained from\u00a0Patrick De Arteaga</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6ee9faa48737dc581e47fa2fc19824f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Eggsquisite"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
