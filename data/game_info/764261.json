The main premise of the game is that you are a student attempting to get through college. Run into powerups to apply for classes, but be careful as applying for too many classes will make your semesters impossible to manage. Finish the game as quickly as possible to have the least amount of debt possible.<br/><br/>Katabasis is a non-profit organization based in North Carolina that specializes in developing educational resources for children in low-income households. Their current largest project revolves around creating STEM Summer camps that teach children how to build their own computers.</p>\n<p>Made using the Unity Game Engine and free assets from the Unity Asset store. Music by Kevin MacLeod, and item pickup sound from Mixkit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T05:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/764/76494ede2718eb75e15f1edff2382fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcusDevelopment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
