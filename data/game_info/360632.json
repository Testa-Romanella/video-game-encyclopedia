Also, we\u00a0 didn't really use unity before. We did try to use it, but didn't have the motivation to learn it, so this was a perfect opportunity. I think the biggest mistake we made is trying to think of an unique idea which turned out to be not so fun at the end. Still, much fun, looking forward to do it again. Much love from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T18:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2901cee97e75758c5961d1e1e9155d3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ramkey", "Sefibra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
