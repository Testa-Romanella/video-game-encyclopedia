It features a story of a suspicious \"Rose\" that is making the game act very strange. It also features characters you meet and some bosses you kill with a powerful flower that you obtain later in the game. You have to obtain the supplies to make the key which leads to the exit of freedom with little you have. But the question is \"is it really an exit\"?<br/>This game is extremely intelligent has the ability to break the fourth wall and act like a real computer nightmare. It will interact with the computer, recognize player actions, and crash the game on purpose to create new events throughout the game meaning you have to restart the game if that happens and more. Please note that this game is 100% harmless in every way and is created for an amazing experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfd5d102e71cd4d06a794f9978c3a952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XerStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
