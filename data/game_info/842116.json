Featuring time-honored gameplay, all the characters of the Hololive/Holostars English branches, a plethora of themed cosmetics and levels to collect and unlock... and unlock how? Through gacha, of course, because why not. In Hololive fangames, it's what we do.</p>\n<p>Available now, for free, of course.</p>\n<p>If you like what you see, this was just a small side project, so keep an eye out, as I do have something more substantial coming out sometime in the near future. Thanks for your time and enjoy this little bit of old school fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:13:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/5952a5d17fedcb8d0333810bb309fa8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["edgemint"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
