As a fan of Analog horror, I wanted to try and make a game about it that is a little different than other Analog games. This game is still in devolpment and our plans are to make this an FPS game (like Resident Evil). We are both beginners and are still learning, so don't expect bugless gameplay while playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T04:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/606/606d39a799f54073094d1c33abbf4d3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timere"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
