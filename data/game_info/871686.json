{"id": 871686, "slug": "faf-public-alpha-build", "name": "FAF (Public Alpha Build)", "name_original": "FAF (Public Alpha Build)", "description": "What is this\r\n<p>FAF is a game in development featuring characters and concepts based on games from Fellacord, a weird Discord server I like a lot. What's currently done here was created in roughly 2 months.<br/><strong>I\u00a0won't mince words. If you aren't a part of that community, there might not be a lot of entertainment for you.</strong> This game expects you to have played\u00a0Fellaquest\u00a0and Fellacord Revengeance, and those are already niche games in their own right.<br/>Still, if you can appreciate rough and strange RPG Maker games, you just might enjoy yourself anyway.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>This game has 4 chapters that you can complete in any order, and each one features a radically different protagonist, setting, and tone.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>EPISODE F: An artificial heart spreads digital chaos. (Appreciation of the story and writing hinges greatly on Fellacord knowledge.)</li><li>FIGHT: An ill-intentioned warrior fights her way to the top. (Fellacord knowledge provides a fuller sense of the story being told.)</li><li>HERO: A masked hero faces a catastrophic emergency. (Fellacord knowledge only enhances the first few minutes and a small handful of jokes.)</li><li>ACTION: A grizzled veteran returns for one final mission. (Requires no\u00a0Fellacord\u00a0knowledge to get the full experience)<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Some chapters have more combat, some chapters have more exploration. What is the same across all of them though is that combat is relatively simple, there are no level ups, you heal after every battle, and there is no menu or item management to be concerned with.</p>\n<p>This build includes:</p>\n<ul><li>the 4 main chapters, playable from start to finish, quality be damned</li><li>lots of stolen and recycled assets!! copyright infringement!!</li><li>bugs and inconsistencies! he he oops!!</li></ul>\n<p>This build does not yet include:</p>\n<ul><li>NAME TAGS FOR CHARACTERS. LOL SORRY TO PEOPLE THAT\u00a0DONT KNOW WHO THESE CHARACTERS ARE OR HAVE BAD MEMORIES</li><li>complete presentation elements, most notably status effect icons</li><li>dialogue for the save point character</li><li>even remotely refined combat balance</li><li>any unlockables\u00a0after beating the 4 chapters</li></ul>\r\nCredits, Thanks\r\n<p>Design, implementation, writing:\u00a0Abbock<br/>Most original assets, concepting help: Toast<br/>Odds and ends, testing: Goiaba</p>\n<p>If you played and enjoyed your time with the game, feel free to read my retrospective on the work done to get the game up to this point.<br/>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yRtG1qNfTQsSKxBNdsY5ES3QPiFDr_ti1oUfWmJJqUY/<br/><br/>More to come.
