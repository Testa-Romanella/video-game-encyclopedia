Before Sunset is a game inspired by an old village me and my sister used to visit, the hometown of our grandparents.<br/><br/>I'm happy that our game is now up on the Steam store page, and over these months before launch there will be constant changes to improve and beautify this store page, as well as updates on the progress.<br/><br/>Me and my sister will be working side by side during the entire development of this game. We aim to create a story rich game that is engaging and full of mystery and twists to keep you at the edge of your seat. We will be incorporating more features such as animated illustrations, and we are really excited to see how it turns out. Do catch them in the game!
