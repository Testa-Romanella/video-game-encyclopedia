You can see how each cell reacts with its neighbors to keep itself alive, revive, or...die! <br/><br/>With this simulation, you can play and pause the simulation as well as change the conditions with which each cell reacts to its neighbors. You can even draw in the cell grid or tap each cell to bring it to life or kill it. <br/><br/>Be mesmerized as simple rules can create beautiful patterns almost as if they were ALIVE.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c172e9342c87bacaa13df7e718abce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Preferred Mobile Applications"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Preferred Mobile Applications"], "esrb_rating": null}
