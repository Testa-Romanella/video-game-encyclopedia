As you descend into the laboratory, you discover the dark history of WHO and its true motives.<br/></p>\n<p>...<br/></p>\n<p>Gain of Function is a Wolf3D-like FPS. The idea was to combine the simplicity of classic FPS level design and graphics with the anxiety-inducting bullet-sponginess of a resident evil game. This was created in 30 days using C++, OpenGL, GLFW, OpenAL, and a couple libraries for reading data formats.   I plan to release the code soon, but I am much too ashamed of its current state as it's full of hacks, sloppy code, spaghetti, and shortcuts. If there's much interest in the game, I'll probably do a few more levels with new weapons, bad guys, and bosses.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T18:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf82268311b22ebb4736bfcc717a710f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shortround"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
