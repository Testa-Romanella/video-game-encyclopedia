In this game you will play as Rabbit &amp; RABBIT, two very different friends that are trying to get their belly full. Eat food, destroy bees, create match-three combos and avoid too many items from crowding the playfield. Every round has a series of action-coins that can be swapped between the two rabbits and reordered to decide the sequence of attacks, actions and movements your characters will perform.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Concept and Illustrations, Animations:</strong> Giulia Olivares (<em>@giulai</em>)\u00a0<br/><strong>Game Design, UI, Animations:</strong> Marco Trevisani (<em>@greencoldmint</em>) &amp; Jacopo Rovida (<em>@Jackrov</em>)\u00a0<br/><strong>Game Design and Development:</strong> Mauro Vanetti (<em>@maurovanetti)</em></p><p><em>This game was created at the\u00a0Global Game Jam 2022 in Pavia, Italy.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d6cb8c87b0631a201297faf49a0b84b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mauro Vanetti", "greencoldmint", "JacopoRovida"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
