You play as an insomniac\u00a0on the verge of sleep, moving through shifting states of consciousness.\u00a0Hallucinatory, pixelated visions of landscapes filled with sprites\u00a0ripped directly from the arcade/NES/SNES video games of your childhood\u00a0appear and disappear as you click through fragile internet spaces.\u00a0Point-n-click mini games are scattered throughout the narrative. Often\u00a0 interrupted, you continually return to the Black Room, a meditation\u00a0technique your mother taught you for falling asleep, visualizing black\u00a0flowers in a black vase on a black table in the center of a black room.</p>\n<p>This game, conceived as a feminist dungeon crawler, features a majority female cast of video game sprites from the 1970s-current day.\u00a0 This work seeks to bring these characters together to form new narratives:\u00a0 Chun Li reposes elegantly in a desert oasis filled with flamingos;\u00a0 Catwoman languidly cartwheels across the nighttime beaches of Coney Island; Jennifer Simpson, the lead character from \u00a0Clock Tower, runs endlessly through the brightly pixelated fantasy landscapes of the Oregon Trail. These narratives appear as \u201cStrange Visions,\u201d to the player, induced by shifting stages of wakefulness.</p>\n<p>Read more about Black Room here: https://hyperallergic.com/424211/a-game-takes-you-into-deep-dreaming/<br/></p>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b7882c3ed76edc8a00142a153fe3dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cassie McQuater"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
