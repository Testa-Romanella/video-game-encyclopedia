This work was born from a Game Jam we participated in after work, due to the limited level, the game itself has many shortcomings. However, with the advice of some friends, we decided to put this game on Steam for free so that more players can play our game.<br/>We are currently working on a puzzle game \"Line Time\" in our spare time, which is expected to be available on Steam later.<br/>(You can search this game in Itch.io)<br/><br/>However, due to the limited time of developers and development, the progress is very slow at the moment, and we hope that the subsequent development can be successfully completed.<br/>Finally, thank you again for liking and supporting our game ~", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T04:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e65e929e4b7026ed880c1ea75de236.jpg", "website": "https://www.gcores.com/games/81346", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FaMo4&FaMo5"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FaMo4&FaMo5"], "esrb_rating": null}
