I've had the idea for this game in my mind for a while and originally envisioned it being made in RPG Maker or something similar. When I realized my idea fit the theme of\u00a0Scream Zone Jam 9, I\u00a0adapted it into a Twine story instead. Since I\u00a0made it in such short notice there may be many typos and grammatical errors. I will hopefully have the time to make a more polished and complete version after the game jam is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Consider this a proof of concept for now!</p>\n<p>6721 words across 75 screens, with spooky low res images.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012cdd5969c3f2186efd7c4de0b8b2ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Geraldo Mercado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
