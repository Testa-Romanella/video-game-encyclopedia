Reveal two body parts and, as a group, organise who can bring these parts together. Make sure they remain in contact\u00a0for the rest of the game. Connecting the first two together is easy, but as you tap the button\u00a0again and again, you'll accumulate new connections.\u00a0See how tangled you can get!<br/></p>\n<p>Alternatively, use Pretzel to construct a short dance! Either alone or in groups, follow the bodily prompts as an impetus for new movement. Instead of just drawing the two points together, explore their relationship in space... their conjoined presence, scale, force or weight.\u00a0Play with the motion of your body like a kinetic toy.</p>\n<p><em>Pretzel was originally the Pretzel card game, which received an Honorable Mention in the 2016 Cardboard Edison Awards.
