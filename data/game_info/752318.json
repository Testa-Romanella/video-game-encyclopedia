Two of the most popular heartthrobs in school, Pico and Steve, gave you chocolates! This is definitely the best moment of your life and will remain so until you one day drop dead. Unfortunately, you caught Ligma which knocked you on your ass for the next 4 weeks. Before you knew it, the White Day School <em>Promdancestravaganza </em>(tm) is coming up! Not only do you not have a gift to give either of them, but you don't even know who you want to go to the dance with!!! If you don't cobble together a proper gift and pick who to go to the dance with TODAY then they'll both reject you, hate you forever, get you kicked out of school, and make you a lonely sad outcast forever. Luckily, your friends have your back, and if you can put together White Day present you might just make it out of this in one piece.\r\n</p>\n<p>Can you put together the best gift ever?\r\n</p>\n<p>Who will you choose for the <em>Promdancestravaganza</em> (tm)?\r\n</p>\n<p>Discover all this and more in Love Me Newgrounds!!!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:31:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66bf503959ad32db031885750f5550b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manlypotato"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
