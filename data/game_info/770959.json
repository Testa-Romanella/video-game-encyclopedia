This strange state in you escaped all conceptual schemas.<br/><br/>Magnus Imago is an atmospheric journey through a mysterious world of characters, traces and symbols.<br/>Unique graphic aesthetics of the game deepens a keen impression of being in another reality.<br/><br/> \u201cMagnus Imago\u201d is a combination of an adventure, exploratory and logical game. The task of the player is to solve the puzzles, using proper combinations of objects, finding them in the environment around him.<br/>The game has aesthetics of a hand drawing, individual comic-sketch style. The story is filled with a language of symbols which may direct the player into a deeper philosophical reflection. We strive for the told story to be open to the player\u2019s individual interpretation, that is why the depicted world is ambiguous.<br/>The game presents a journey of the main character as he learns the truth about himself, in a mysterious world around him. The story told within the game has an ambition of touching such philosophical-theological aspects as a soul\u2019s wandering or metanoia.<br/><br/>The estimated time of the game is about 1 to 2 hours<br/><br/>This is the next installment of the Magnus series (first one is Magnus Failure). The next planned chapter will be \"Magnus: phototaxis positive\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T09:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72a9842ca358b776f76e94f2b24fe7d.jpg", "website": "https://magnusimago.tumblr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sons of welder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Polyslash", "Sons of welder", "FM Simple Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
