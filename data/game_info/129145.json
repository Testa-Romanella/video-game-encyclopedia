Then select your layout (most likely QWERTY I think).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNow imagine your hand is a little guy or spider that wants to climb from the 1st, bottom row (\"1,Q,A,Z\" on a QWERTY layout) to the 9th row (\"9,O,L,Period\"). To climb you'll have to hold on to the keys you've already reached and try out the keys higher up to get a grip on them.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCheck out this image to see the area.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em>I've added support for QWERTY (EU and US), AZERTY and Dvorak layouts. Let me know if I'm missing a common layout, I'll see if I can add it.</em><em><br/>\n</em>\n</p>Screen output<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Black screen means you're at the bottom and not climbing or holding on.</li>\n<li>Blinking means you've just pressed a valid key and are about to grab it.</li>\n<li>Solid color means you're holding on to all the keys you're currently pressing and ready to move on.</li>\n<li>When you reach and grab a key on the final row the screen will flash rapidly for a few seconds and go blank. You've made it! Try again!</li>\n</ul>Rules<ul>\n<li>Only play with one hand! (the game doesn't know, obviously, but no cheating)</li>\n<li>You can only climb to a row if you're <strong>already holding two keys on the row before it</strong>. (doesn't apply to the first row of course)</li>\n<li>If you're holding less than two keys you'll fall down.</li>\n<li>Your grabbed keys can't span more than three rows, you'll have to let go of the lower keys as you move up.</li>\n<li>A few random keys are blocked to make it harder, <strong>and because of the way keyboards work, some combinations of simultaneous key presses will block other keys, this is all part of the challenge!</strong> Try moving around on your current row if you're stuck. </li>\n<li>(Pressing Tab will show/hide some debug info about which buttons are pushed, but that's cheating)</li>\n</ul><p>\r\nI hope it makes sense, drop a line in the comments if you have questions or suggestions.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Jam rules disclaimer thing: Yes, there are buttons for choosing the keyboard layout, but I have no idea how to detect which layout you have (or if it's even possible in the browser). The game itself is purely 1-bit and the alternative might be something silly like separate downloads for each layout  ;)</em>\n</p>Check out my other submission to the jam!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babe3f0bac53805a4a73f22c01b107e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aergia"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
