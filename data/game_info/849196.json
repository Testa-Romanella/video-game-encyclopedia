However, in true anime fashion, the protagonist uses his \"Power of Friendship\"\u00a0once he has been dealt a grave injury. The only way to stop him is to interrupt his dramatic flashback, which is the source of\u00a0every protagonist's power.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours for Mini Jam 114. The theme was \"Anime\", and the limitation was \"Locked in Place\". I felt this gave me the perfect opportunity to make fun of a few common tropes in\u00a0anime, such as the protagonist having a dramatic flashback, while the villain waits patiently. Your character is anything but patient.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T03:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724d65da257424997643ad03f5756a5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["spicy_cup_ramen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
