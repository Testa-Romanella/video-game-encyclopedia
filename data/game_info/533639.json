You will need precise aim and\u00a0 smart use of your climbing spells.</p>\n<p>The first two levels are easy, the next 3 are hard and the rest are really-really hard to solve. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n</p>\n<p>The trick? Your spells can hit you too !<br/>1. Enchant all animals on the map as your recipe requires !</p>\n<p>Mister Vampire requires different animals for his potions. One problem is that they are far away. But you can use magic - just shoot your transformation spell towards them.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that you do not have a spell for each animal - so , if you hit a frog - it will transform to chicken, but if you hit the new chicken - it will transform to cat. Hitting the cat will transform it back to frog and so on.</p>\n<p>2. Unlock all levels and collect stars.</p>\n<p>Different levels require different strategies. Also, since the game is physics based - you will have a different gameplay each time you start the level. The last 10 levels are the hardest ones !</p>\n<p>3. Be smart with the use of your special spell - going upside down on the ceiling</p>\n<p>This comes in handy if there are many obstacles between you and the animals . But you can only do it once per level! So choose wisely!</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a demo of the complete game , that is available on Android :\u00a0https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=achhobby.mrvampire.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f63bdc27078656b21442acc3e2fda1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ACHhobby"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
