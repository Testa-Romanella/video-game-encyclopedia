As you make your journey through this world, you find other robots- who want you dead!<br/><br/>Doohickey presents a merger between platform and bullet-hell mechanics. Move through each room using buttons and target triggers to activate the doorways to escape, while either dodging or shooting back at the enemy bots. Manage your rate of fire with your recharging energy pistol, and collect health from downed enemies. Survive each room, determine your final score totaling your time per room, kills, and token collection- then try to beat it playing again!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14eca834235adf4b9a8951041a5454cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["studiofortis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
