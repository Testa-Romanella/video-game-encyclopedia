So far, it made me want to use the game engine more.\u00a0 It was fairly simple to make this game, and it's like an endless/infinite shooter (top down) game, basically shoot as many enemy cubes as you can and test your skills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game is only for Windows OS desktops/laptops only so far. My future games may probably be made for mobile, other OS', etc. too. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40a/40ad4f7acc77273f1dbcfa5d69817d0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["minelordsuniverse@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
