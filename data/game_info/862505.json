Play as our young hero Mr. Seal as he embarks on his unfortunate quest.</p>\n<p> How to play Defeat the robotic AI boss before you are surrounded by an unstoppable force of mutant monsters. Enter wormholes to teleport yourself to the AI's lair and start chissling down the boss's hp. The catch of course is, you only get to fight him for 10 seconds at a time. Will you defeat the boss, or succumb to the AI's horde of crazyness? Note from the developers:<br/>Whatever your expectations are, just lower them to the floor and raise it a smidge. We were pretty rushed, far too ambitious, and cut many corners. We managed to get a fraction of this game together. It's been fun to create and I hope you enjoy Seal and Gun Controls WASD to move Left Click to fire Mouse to aim Hold shift to run Spacebar to jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51c/51cb6c368e44d30a3f53d17f333aac0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BountyMouseStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
