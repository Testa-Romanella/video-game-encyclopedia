During this adventure there were never any thoughts of publishing this game.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAfter hearing about the Indievelopment 2013 contest at the last moment they scrambled to submit Offworld and were surprised to hear that it had earned third prize! This inspired some team members to start Tengu Games. After releasing their debut game Elementalist for mobile devices they came back to their first: Offworld.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAfter a good overhaul of the graphics, weapon systems and adding bigger explosions Offworld is now available, at the cost of just your soul!
