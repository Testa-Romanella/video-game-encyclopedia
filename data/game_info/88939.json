Similar to basketball it is the goal is to throw the egg (instead of the ball) into the basket. First practice and then try to hit as often as possible with a limited number of shots.<br/><br/>How to play: Tap and hold the egg and drag the finger into the direction you want to shoot. The length determines the speed of the shot. Release the finger to shoot. The egg bounces realistically from the trees and the basket. So you can even do trick shots.<br/><br/>Adjust the difficulty by changing the number of attempts, fixing the basket and changing the gravity.<br/><br/>Happy Easter!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T17:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1579a7bbf63ba06a9a65c405538a4ca6.jpg", "website": "http://easterball.speedymarks.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Piet Jonas"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Piet Jonas"], "esrb_rating": null}
