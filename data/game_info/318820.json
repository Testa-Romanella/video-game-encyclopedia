However the idea is far beyond the scope of just shooting plates. I will be adding a crafting system, and right now there's already 2 guns and 17 something skins to collect. Each skin is quite different and some even have cool flashy effects. There's also some mystery bags that in future will have more than just gold and skin tickets.<br/><br/>Right now you can upgrade a few things to increase your chance of earning gold. I'm quite happy to say that the entire game can pretty much be played with just the mouse. Keep in mind this is a very early stage of the game and I'm not working on it full time. That's all I can really say about it, so how about giving it a go? <em>Go show those plates who's the real gunslinger in town!</em><br/><br/>(PS the saving system is kinda weird at the moment, use ESC to return to the main menu hit save and you should be okay)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d5/1d5f80ba39cc8e94190a97b6924be589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PronomicalArt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
