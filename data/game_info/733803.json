First, I added all of the planets in the solar system and the Earth's moon; they each have their rotations and sounds. All of them rotate at different speeds; the farther they are from the sun, the slower they orbit. Additionally, I modified both the cameras to fit the entire solar system in the frame. Lastly, I rotated the main camera up so that you could see all of the planets simultaneously as they orbit the sun.</p>\n<p>Created by: Soren Gerlach</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b911f8f5b5e0abd4c8625dec291c4621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gerlac32"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
