Match 3 or more snoods in a row to clear them or even make other surrounding snoods fall. \u00a0Clear all the snoods to beat each level. \u00a0Keep an eye on your Danger meter! \u00a0Each time it fills the snoods inch closer to the bottom. Once they're low enough you lose. \u00a0Making snoods fall will lower your Danger meter.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>- <strong>Left and Right \u00a0</strong>-- Rotate launcher left and right<br/>- <strong>X</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-- Launch snood<br/>- <strong>Z</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-- Hold in conjunction with Left or Right to aim more precise shots</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd43344215e130d285c2e44858a2d1a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DanB91"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
