In a deadly game of solitaire, you are asked to rank mortality risks from small to large.   <br/><br/>This game uses real statistics about real risks. Warning: play leads to real knowledge about risk from plane crashes, heart disease, and snake bite. Your friends may not thank you. <br/><br/>This game is based on the psychology of risk, risk communication and gamification. It was written by a law professor and a public policy game designer from Harvard. All research for the game is free and publicly available, including tips for other public policy game designers.
