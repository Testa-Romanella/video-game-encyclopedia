However, when you actually play the game it's much harder than it seems. There are three levels to beat the game, including two and three-hit blocks which must be hit two or three time respectively to be destroyed. The game has a hero theme to it and I found/made all the graphics for the game myself.</p><p>While making this game I learned many important Unity skills. For example, I learned more about transform.position and how to control object placement in a scene through code. Another skill I learned was how to make triggers by creating a trigger that when to the lose scene after a person has lost a level and colliders when the ball comes in contact with both the paddle and the bricks. I also learned how to add velocity to objects, create and change hit sprites, create sprite sheets as well as other skills. I also used the skills I learned from class escape to create scenes so you can replay the level without restarting from the beginning.</p><p>I hope continue using the skills I've learned to help me create future games. Learning how to control object movement from scripts is a skill that I know I'll use extensively in my later games. As of now I still want to change the music, and add sound effects and lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aae521a51862944e7c0ad29df53a014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["abigaylebrooks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
