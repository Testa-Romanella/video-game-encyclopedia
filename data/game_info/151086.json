Here it is! Please go and have a look, and this game could end up on Steam if you like it! It also includes screenshots and trailers for you to look at before you get this game, so you know what you're buying.</p><p>Visibility is a puzzle-based platformer in which you must navigate your way through levels using lights you place. <br/><br/>At the start of a level, the screen will be black. You must place the lights which illuminate your path to the finish. Pressing the spacebar will let you see yourself and the exit, and you will also be able to place lights. However you cannot move in this mode, and your lights will not show the way to the finish until you once again hit the spacebar. This will make the level appear and the lights will illuminate what they can. It may start off basic, but as you progress through 13 levels (more to come) you will find yourself dying many, many times.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59ebe6a66771627e6acfc044c3d0f32a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Flyinpig5"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
