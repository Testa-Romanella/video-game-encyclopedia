If you have enough ammunition, try to use a heavy gun to clean up the enemy!<br/>\r\nDon't trust any survivors like you who came from other survivor camps to loot the city. They're more interested in ripping supplies off your hands than they are in a time-consuming search of the city, and humans are much scarier than zombies.<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Death!<br/>\r\nOnce your character dies, you lose all the equipment and supplies you carry, so survival is the key to this game. When your character is killed, you might want to try your luck with scavengers team, who are experts in salvaging lost objects.<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Dark!<br/>\r\nFace the endless night of the zombie crisis, then feel your way through the darkness. But in the face of other survivors, night may be your weapon.<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Refit!<br/>\r\nWith more than 60 weapons and nearly 200 modified accessories, modify the strongest and most reliable weapons you like to shoot zombies!<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Manage!<br/>\r\nIrregular item size backpack system. There's always a lot of trash to pick up, so manage your backpack, ditch the worthless goods, and leave with what's really useful.<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Explore!<br/>\r\nGo to different city scenes and explore different buildings. Be careful with your ammo and supplies, and plan your escape time, once your ammo runs out you will not be able to leave the city alive.<br/>\r\n\u25b2 Camp!<br/>\r\nWhile in camp, you'll be safe, interacting with different NPCS, managing warehouses, selling or buying supplies and equipment, or trading treasured supplies for rare items, and of course, you'll be able to talk to an instructor about training programs to improve yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n***Because I am developing the game alone, my ability and energy are limited, I hope you can understand. It may take me a long time to get around to the reviews, but I will try to make the game better as soon as possible, so give me some time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u3010 Update Plan \u3011<br/>\r\nTask system<br/>\r\nPet system<br/>\r\nRole DIY system<br/>\r\nTotal difficulty selection system \u3010 Completed \u221a\u3011<br/>\r\nNew talent stat system<br/>\r\nNew more accurate minimap feature<br/>\r\nGame handbook system<br/>\r\nCooking system<br/>\r\nMap special TAG<br/>\r\nBackpack independent window<br/>\r\nMore buildings<br/>\r\nMore guns<br/>\r\nMore gun accessories<br/>\r\nMore props<br/>\r\nMore zombie types<br/>\r\nCamp Arms wall feature, can display the player's own collection of weapons<br/>\r\nAnd some other small features (one-click organizing, splitting items, etc.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T07:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0aca379b59d61a3ae9fccde50bd7800a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tsukuyomi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tsukuyomi"], "esrb_rating": null}
