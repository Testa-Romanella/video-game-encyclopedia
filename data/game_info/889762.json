Two wars started and finished before anyone could even touch the clerics. Their power is overwhelming...</p>\n<p>A rebellion is rising, but it is necessary to gather information about the clerics, so that any weakness can be spotted. There are some spies within the cleric's temple. Will they find some allies, or everyone is an enemy?<br/></p>\n<p>This interactive story was made as a challenge/miniJam/ where I had to finish it in three days and had to use only AI generated images. This is the first time I make one and I had lots of fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the narrative I used Fungus and\u00a0Fungus repo, which I had never used before and I found it quite helpful to approach this endeavior.</p>\n<p>All the images, as aforementioned, were generated using an AI. I don't mean to replace an artist's work, nor do I think that is the purpose of that software. I was just challenging myself: Do this project within the deadline and learn new tools throughout the process.</p>\n<p>The AI software used:</p>\n<ul><li>Dall-e , for the backgrounds</li><li>Stable diffusion for the characters</li></ul>\n<p>Sound assets taken from:</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/Nathan_Lomeli/sounds/79184/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/anagar/sounds/267931/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/AUDACITIER/sounds/632128/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/SpaceJoe/sounds/484912/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Akatukoaut/sounds/500997/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Thedust82/sounds/215639/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T20:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/0694f5c5fbfd7a9d9802b4d509dd2aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mauricio Camargo Santos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
