Build a shelter to survive cold nights and share your worlds online. Ride horses, camels or donkeys and herd cattle to protect them from predators. Blast your way through the rock with explosives. Build complex electric devices. Possibilities are infinite in this long-running sandbox survival and construction game series.<br/> <br/>This is the thirtieth release of Survivalcraft, and it adds a new armor and weapons tier - copper!
