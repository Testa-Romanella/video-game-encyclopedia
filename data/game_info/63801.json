Go from simply wishing you were a ball chasing wolf to actually experiencing it first hand.  You no longer have to live without Wolf Balls--get yours today!  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWolf Balls re-imagines the time honored tradition of hitting a ball.  Following in the footsteps of soccer, lacrosse, basketball, golf, pok ti pok, and related closely to pinball, this ancient practice has spanned many cultures and forms, and now it has reached its pinnacle evolutionary existence.  As a giant wolf you get to explore exotic medieval locales as you run and jump and chase the ball, hitting it with your left hand or using a force grab to control it with the right, all while scoring points and trying to keep the ball from going past the flippers.  Scoring 10,000 points opens the level portal, allowing you to take your wolf to new locations like a graveyard, a snowy mountain village, and even a full moon level for extra wolf powers!   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDisclaimer<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHaving Wolf Balls on Steam is different than having wolf balls in real life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a0c6fabcb240fefaacb0346ff29c0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["N.R.
