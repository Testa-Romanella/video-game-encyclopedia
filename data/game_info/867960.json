Play with up to 8 friends  in a LAN or online, and up to 8 characters with unique abilities that changes the way the game is played in 5 different arenas!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The rules are basic, you play in an equally divided arena and have 30 seconds to pick a move you're going to make for the battle sequence. The game encourages communication between teams to determine each of their moves, as the teams will not be able to see what moves their opponents are making except during the sequences. Each team shares Magic Points (MP) that allows a player to perform a MAGIC move.</p>\n<p>During the sequence, the order of which the players performs their action is determined by the move type (primary) and the character's speed (secondary). GUARD players go first, MAGIC players go next, then ATTACK players go last.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>ATTACK - Makes the player attack their selected target. Rewards 2 MP by default and an additional 4+ MP if the character scored a critical hit.</li><li>GUARD - Raises the player's <em>DEFENSE\u00a0</em>only for the next sequence. Rewards 6 MP by default.</li><li>MAGIC - Each characters have their own unique abilities that changes the way the battle turns out. MAGIC costs MP and varies for different characters and their moves/spells.</li></ul>\n<p>If a player doesn't make a move before the timer runs out, they will default to the GUARD move and get no MP for that turn.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Input Shortcuts</strong><br/></p>\n<p>F1 Key - Toggle Using UPnP (USE AT OWN RISK) <em>*Disabled on HTML5 Version</em><br/></p>\n<p>F5 Key - Toggle Fullscreen <em>*Disabled on Mobile/HTML5 Version</em><br/></p>\n<p>U Key/Xbox B/PS Circle/Nintendo A - Show/Hide Usernames (in-game)<br/></p>\n<p>F Key/Xbox Y/PS Triangle/Nintendo X - Show/Hide Framerate</p>\n<p>[ Key/D-Pad Up - Increase Target Framerate</p>\n<p>] Key/D-Pad Down - Decrease Target Framerate</p>\n<p>0 Key/D-Pad Right - Next Mouse Cursor</p>\n<p>9 Key/D-Pad Left - Previous Mouse Cursor</p>\n<p>T Key/Xbox X/PS Square/Nintendo Y - Show/Hide Chat (in-game)<br/></p>\n<p><em>Target framerate options are 0 (Unlimited) 15, 24, 30, 48, 60, 90, 120, 144</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank my family/friends who gave feedback and encouragement regarding this project.
