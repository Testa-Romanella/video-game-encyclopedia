Destroy the POW \n      armor and 1 of 6 different units will appear, which you can then use to \n      power up your R-9. Equip Bits and obtain Laser Units to make the Force \n      appear and to power it up. The Force can then be integrated into or \n      separated from your R-9. Make the most of your weapons, including the \n      Reflecting Laser Beams, Air-to-Surface, and Antiaircraft Lasers. Keep \n      pressing the fire button to fire blasts from the Beam Cannon. Press and \n      hold the fire button to charge the Beam Gauge, then release it to fire a \n      devastating Wave Cannon blast! The longer you hold it, the stronger the \n      blast! The ultimate highlights are the N32bosses that await you at the \n      end of each stage, including a stage that pits you against a giant \n      warship.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
