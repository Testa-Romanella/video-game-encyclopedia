And already their petty infighting has the world trembling on the jagged edge of atomic war.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe task of retrieving the Jewels falls to you, Orin the Falconer -- the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen.

If you are able to return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace, the Earth will pass into another millennium of peace and plenty.
