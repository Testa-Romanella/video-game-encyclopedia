We focused on the mechanic of colouring in tiles and expanded on that. Now you can grab a buddy and fight for dominance on the playing field. While colouring tiles you can strategically place traps to foil the opposite players game run. But be careful! You\u2019ll also be chased by an almost invisible enemy, who\u2019s out for your life.\u00a0 As the all over game winner you\u2019ll be treated to a cutscene of your characters dream. Nightmare or bliss? It\u2019s all up to you.</p>\n<p>This game was developed for the module \"game mechanics I\" at Game Design ZHdK.<br/></p>\n<p>Game Developers:</p>\n<p>lholzenb.itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>sk8terboii.itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:42:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/80709e145230b637c914263002ba9535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sk8terboii", "lholzenb"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
