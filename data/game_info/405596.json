But the platform is weird. You won't know if the platform really exist or not until you find out what's going on.<br/>Every time you hit a spike, some platforms will either be shown or hidden including the spikes.<br/>You can do multiple jump somehow, and jump while in the air for a short time. This is unintended at the first time, so I made some level must utilize this method.</p>\n<p>Control:</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right Arrow to Move.</li><li>Up Arrow to Jump</li><li>ESC to Exit the Game</li></ul>\n<p>Code, art, audio, etc by RZFury.<br/>Font used In-Game: Pixeled by OmegaPC777</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a55d3ebb09d3d90a5f2fd01941bfc17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RZFury"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
