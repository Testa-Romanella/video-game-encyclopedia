However, the city of Agaris is terrified by an attack by scientist called Aizack protected by 3 incredibly strong robots that help him steal fuel from the research center, fighting the security troops. This fuel is what he needs so he can travel back in time with the machine he built. The scientist aims to distort reality, and make an ideal world for him. More precisely, to go back 1000 years ago. He intends to take the princess's necklace, whose powers are capable of summoning extremely powerful demons, but which over time has been deteriorated and destroyed. All this in the middle of the year 1130, coincidentally in the year that Gorgos emerged from the depths and installed chaos and destruction around the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0However, still in the present, Henzo, Willie and Lenna discover the scientist's plans, and decide to follow him to protect the story lived until now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0A lot is yet to come in the story. Characters from the past will join the team to help them, villains who have nothing to do with it will come and mess things up, and more.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T09:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08b62a6bc4c71cf114b4dbec87a0ed01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mattheus Reis Queiroga"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
