The first is a rounding error. The upgrade cost is always supposed to be a whole number, but sometimes reads like \"300.000001.\" The second is a programming error. When you reach max level of an upgrade, it should read \"MAX.\" But instead reads something like \"1+E7,\" which I believe is indicating a very large number.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-21T05:50:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/382/382d83f8cbdbab798598271096a721fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aj_W"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
