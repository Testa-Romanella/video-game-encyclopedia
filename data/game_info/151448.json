You will be able to carry up to two weapons and upgrade each one of them up to three levels. But choose wisely and be careful, dying means to start over.<br/> There are a lot of different enemies with different mechanics that will spawn in higher quantities as your score becomes higher. Move carefully around the space while firing in order to survive the longest.<br/> Every once in a while, a special hazzard will also show up: Avoid asteroids, move around clouds or try to survive while sunflares block your view.<br/> But above everything, remember that YOU must be the best player! Get the highest highscore of all time, at least for a second, and win the so much desired \"Over the top\" medal!<br/> ---<br/> Asterash features an original score by CoreWars. https://soundcloud.com/corewarsofficial<br/> ---<br/> Asterash was powered by Framework Mono. monoflauta.com/portfolio/frameworkstools/framework-mono/<br/>---<br/>If you want to compete for the medals and the highscore, you will need to play it at Newgrounds, please click the next link: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/690047</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a0b497181640064c3bd19e4a32cbe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MonoFlauta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
