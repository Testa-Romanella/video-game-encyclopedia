The theme was \u2018Ritual\u2019, and a \r\ngenerating idea for this was the ritual of returning to a place from \r\nmemory. In March of 2013 I made some significant modifications to the \r\nnature of the work\u2019s interactivity, and I think the experience is better\r\n as a result.</p><p>NOTE: I\u2019ve had trouble with crackly sound on my Windows 8 machine, but I\r\n don\u2019t know how to begin fixing it. Hopefully you don\u2019t encounter this too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f0688561445ec24354934a7d8f25b20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GregWS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
