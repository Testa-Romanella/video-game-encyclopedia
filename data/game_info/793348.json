{"id": 793348, "slug": "sphere-itch-eversoar", "name": "Sphere (itch) (Eversoar)", "name_original": "Sphere (itch) (Eversoar)", "description": "<p>Sphere is a game about exploring wrecked ships in a space junkyard. In the alpha, you play as a Marshall, an agent on a mission to find the source of a mysterious and fast-spreading contagion.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sphere is currently in a very early alpha phase! If you are feeling extra helpful today, do feel free to leave feedback in the discussion board.<br/></p>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Features\r\n<ul><li><strong>Modular shipwreck generator</strong>: Ships are assembled from basic shapes and dynamically filled with rooms and objects for both randomness and consistent structure.</li><li><strong>Immersive ship environments:</strong> Rooms drain of oxygen when the hull is damaged. Fires can start, spread and consume oxygen. Gravity can be switched on and off. Many objects you encounter have real functions, such as monitoring and power supply.</li><li><strong>Challenging close-quarters fights:</strong> Enemies, player characters and their equipment have a large range of strengths and weaknesses. Damage limbs, use cover, adjust your aim mode and perform special attacks and movement actions.</li></ul>\n\r\nState of Development\r\n<p>Sphere has been in development for about three years now. The game is written from scratch, and most work has gone into creating a solid framework for UI and and level generation.</p>\n<p>The current version includes \"Arcade-mode\" only, which is shorter and more combat focussed. Length-wise, Sphere is perhaps more of a coffee-break roguelike at this point, with one or two hours of content. <br/></p>\n<p>The next step will be to flesh out ship interiors, improving the level design and adding both loot and interaction with the ship systems, and then, to widen the game's scope more towards Campaign Mode, the planned exploration and base-building aspects. Campaign Mode is actually implemented in parts, but will require a lot of additional work.</p>\n\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p><strong>Version 0.3 \u2013 Nomad</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The campaign mode of the game, where you travel around the junk ring in search of an ancient artifact</li><li>Multiple starting classes</li><li>Repair and upgrade your very own junk ship</li><li>Limited permadeath - characters may perish, but the ship continues its journey</li><li>Maintain fuel, O2 and food supply on your ship, both for yourself and your crew</li><li>Fix and construct both ship systems and gear</li><li>Keycard system - Find and hack for keycards and access around the ship</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.4 \u2013 Progression Update</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Gain skills and traits - characters learn from experience and trials</li><li>Global unlocks in the form of new starting classes and permanent bonuses</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f5e9bcec372dee9e8ba18c523829f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Eversoar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
