It's a 2D platformer with critical thinking based combat where each different enemy feels like a puzzle to solve instead of relying on brute hack &amp; slash tactics. Almost everything in the game dies in one hit, including you. So caution and critical thinking is highly incentivized.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T13:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6f9283e5ca9071c324d2474cf4a226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arfhis The Wizard"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
