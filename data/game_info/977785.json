{"id": 977785, "slug": "flappy-box-3", "name": "Flappy Box", "name_original": "Flappy Box", "description": "This exhibition, brought to you by Atelier 58I0 in collaboration with designer Saul Kim, presents \"Architecture Anomaly\" in the playable virtual environment of Flappy Box. Navigate the world and space of Flappy Box, immersing yourself in an experience of a surreal world of architectural design and theory.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the 17th installment in this series, the Flappy Box gallery invites you to navigate multiple levels, each dedicated to a distinct architectural concept. There is no specific objective; instead, the exhibition encourages you to enjoy, investigate, and understand these concepts at your own pace, fostering a sense of curiosity and leisure as you wander through Flappy Box. From spotting a life-size anomaly in the foggy distance to riding an elevator to the rooftop, this playable, digital exhibition challenges typical architectural design consumption. Within this virtual world and its galleries, you will gain unprecedented up-close, first-person POV access to 3-D digital models, drawings, and writings of the Architecture Anomaly series. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis unique structure seamlessly blends conceptual elements with practical functionality. The exhibition focuses on three core concepts: Singularity, Anti-Conformity, and Momentum. These architectural ideas draw inspiration from speculative realism while reflecting the designer's evolving interests over time. The building itself stands as a tangible embodiment of all three concepts, inviting visitors to explore the intersection of creativity, curiosity, and design philosophy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAtelier 58l0, established in 2022, is dedicated to challenging one\u2019s relationship with art and architecture through exhibitions, filmmaking, architecture design, and virtual reality. The group consists of young designers with diverse architectural interests but shared goals.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T11:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/783c63f14ad53f707e87d4cec077e210.jpg", "website": "https://www.atelier58l0.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atelier 58l0"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atelier 58l0"], "esrb_rating": null}
