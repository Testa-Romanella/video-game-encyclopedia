{"id": 421225, "slug": "cash-cows", "name": "Cash Cows", "name_original": "Cash Cows", "description": "<p>This is a top-down 2-player action game, about two minotaurs who live in a maze. Thieves are entering the maze to steal the minotaurs' life savings, so they are trying to stop the thieves in their tracks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I like to think of this game as a lot like a tower defense game, where the player is the tower, and they move around the screen. Just like a tower defense game the goal is to not let the enemies reach a specific location, but unlike a tower defense game there are no towers.</p>\n<p>Some parts of the game that I really like are the level select screen (as I have never put a select screen like that in a game of mine before), the way the walls look where you can see the tops and sides of the wall so it looks like you are looking from a perspective, and the way the different characters look.</p>\n<p>This game was made by myself over the first week of the coronavirus quarantine in March of 2020 using Gamemaker Studio 2. The music is by Micah Hood (their info is below).</p>\n<p>Music: Cherrywood Forest by Micah Hood (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu7Mh...)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df85c4b7e2048420a741847a47793fd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Josh Finkel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
