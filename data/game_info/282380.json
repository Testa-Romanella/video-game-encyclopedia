It's about getting messages from drunk people, about the need to justify what you're doing and maybe just\u00a0about ordinary teenage-kitsch, too.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe game mixes personal experiences with fiction and would best be described as a mood-game. It's not\u00a0necessarily about the story itself, but about a specific feeling at a specific time. It takes about 10 - 15 minutes to complete.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nEmoji icons provided free by EmojiOne\r\nPhotography by\u00a0Elisey Vavulin,\u00a0Kayla Farmer,\u00a0S A R A H \u2717 S H A R P,\u00a0Thomas Schweighofer,\u00a0Marleena Garris,\u00a0Ben VanHorn, Isaac Castillejos\u00a0via Unsplash", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c5076cbc77f25732732459e883dbbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabian Denter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
