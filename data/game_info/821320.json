After 5 rolls it's the other player's turn to find sheep. But beware of the thunder! If you roll the storm clouds, your turn ends immediately. The game ends as soon as one of the players has found 5 sheep.</p>\n<p>There are two player modes:<br/></p>\n<p>Player vs Computer: In this mode the dice are rolled automatically for player 2.</p>\n<p>Player vs Player: In this mode both players need to press a button to roll the dice.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to make more dice game variation in this game, but had too many other things to do this weekend. I'm happy I got this working the way I planned it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Game design: Kethram's Games</p>\n<p>Programmer: Imelda Weijers (aka Kethram)</p>\n<p>3D models: created by me in Blender and Unity</p>\n<p>Images: Freepik.com</p>\n<p>Music: Ultimate Music Bundle</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to:\u00a0Alexander Zotov (YouTube tutorial)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/16266fd28dad7f329f78015d421b8d27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kethram"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
