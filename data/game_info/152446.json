I wrote much of the game on my daily commute during March 2013, Women's History Month.</p><p>The game is a short and minimalist celebration of the Women's Social and Political Union, the iconic activist group who campaigned vigorously for women's right to vote during the early years of the 20th Century in the United Kingdom. They were known for advocating civil disobedience and window-breaking as a form of protest. So this is a game about breaking windows.</p><p>The game has no sound. It took me a while to settle on the final title, it was initially called<em>Toffee Hammer</em> and then <em>Deeds Not Words</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20bdcd5f154e2efa1905d8e2c120915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["psepho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
