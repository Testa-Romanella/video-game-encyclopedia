Innovative controls and fluid gameplay allow players to choose their own pace, whether fast as a hack'n'slash or methodic as chess. It\u2019s fresh gameplay to a classic genre - moving and attacking are the same thing!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In a remote village where everyone is given a specific role, Kim was chosen as their guardian. Peace reigned for centuries, and the warrior role was a mere tradition tracing back to ancient times of conflict.<br/><br/>Soon after Kim turned twelve, a distress call was sensed by her trainer - her own, adorable grandmother - who ordered her to protect the village against an impending attack.<br/><br/>Kim was sent to fight without even knowing what violence was. Following a trail of brainwashed minions and high-tech robot soldiers, she would soon find herself in the middle of a world-domination plot carried on by an evil corporation<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Keen's main innovation lies in its turn-based movement and attack mechanics.
