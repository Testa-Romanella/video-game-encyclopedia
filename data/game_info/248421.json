Meet Brucie and Jade, a pair of investigators that combat evil spirits with their spiritual and psychic powers. After being sprayed with a fire hose just because they are poor, they stumble across an interesting case in a high school nearby: Two students have been seriously injured in suspicious accidents. A high school student, Lucy, hires Brucie and Jade to save her friend Sapphire, who may be next.<br/><br/>In your quest to save Sapphire, combat evil with traditional JRPG turn-based combat but without the grind. A short yet solid game, Physical Exorcism doesn\u2019t waste your time. Its fun and relaxing atmosphere covers a meaningful commentary on human relationships that will leave you in contemplation.
