Play to unlock cosmetic ship upgrades and increasingly more difficult game modes. Approximately a 2 hour experience to complete, but still fun and easy to jump back into during a coffee break to beat your high scores. Addictive, infuriating fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong><br/>This is a color and sound based rhythm game. Go fast, avoid obstacles, and score big.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>How it works</strong><br/>Score points for each set you successfully avoid.\u00a0<br/>Spend points to unlock cosmetic enhancements.<br/>Score big to unlock harder difficulty levels.<br/><br/>Unlock Slow-Mode using points for an easier ride. Although this is not needed to complete Direct, the gradual increasing speed allows for a higher skill ceiling for higher scores.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/280aea367158715c6b1613493b6815b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToastieLabs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
