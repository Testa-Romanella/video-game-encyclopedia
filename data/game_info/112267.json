Thanks! :D<br/></p>\n<p>Please report any issues you may have found, I will try to fix them, I am aware of some bugs that are still in there, but it should be largely playable.</p>\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n<p>The game has no sound/music, this is because I couldn't chuck it in there in the time left, I absolutely recommend you play some rhythmic music while you solve puzzles however :D<br/></p>\r\nHeartjam Source: https://github.com/profan/dimensional-scarcity", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60ce340c48b7d0b89edf1078a57516fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["profan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
