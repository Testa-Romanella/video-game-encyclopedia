Find the key to get out of the maze.</p>\n<p>Move with WASD (or arrow keys),\u00a0Shoot with LMB, change Weapon with the mouse wheel, Run with SHIFT, pause with ESC.</p>\n<p>Germ Game is essentially a sound design and interactive music portfolio sample. The track adapts itself to each room while keeping a rythmic and harmonic coherence. I added a slider for the music volume in the menu so you can enjoy the deliciously slimy and oppressive\u00a0sounds I designed for each asset. You might also hear different kind of reverbs as you progress through the maze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I pre-designed most sounds\u00a0on Ableton with various tools (spurting sounds in the mic, using layers of synths, grain delay and your usual sound design shenanigans). The implementation of these and the customiszed reverb zones\u00a0were done using FMOD and some light C# scripting.</p>\n<p>The audio track is going for a SanoDg feel, I might release it as a full non-interactive track later so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Known bugs:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- footsteps can't be heard when using the rifle, somehow. The Gun and the Rifle share the same script so they also sound the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Sometimes, changing weapons with the mouse wheel will trigger your weapon to shoot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd98e918a51f09972bd6e071d5a1df30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Wojtek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
