I did everything on it but the music for Retro Jam 2021. It took about a week. It's definitely still got some rough spots and things I'd like to work on but for my experience, I'm really proud of what I put together by myself in such a short time. Hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, find cans of spray paint and tag as much of the city as you can before finding the exit! Are you a toy or a legend?</p>\n<p>***TIP*** If you're having trouble spray painting make sure you have a can and try walking back and forth while hitting the tag button. Didn't have time to work the kinks out before submission!</p>\n<p>Generic Controller support is here but I didn't test it much.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Space - Jump</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Keypad [0] or LMB - Tag</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>\"Bit Bossa\" by Azure Flux</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/user/azuremakingsound</p>\n<p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/4956573dd3cf5d6cf3dfe91ebab3e2ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AesopB3EF"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
