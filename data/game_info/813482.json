Seize the resource production centers, and command your hand-crafted army to victory!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - move camera forward, left, back, and right<br/></p>\n<p>QE - move camera up and down</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - rotate camera<br/></p>\n<p>Right Click - open building build menu</p>\n<p>Escape - exit building build menu<br/></p>\n<p>Delete - demolish buildings near cursor<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Shift + Left Click - open unit build menu (when cursor is over a unit factory)</p>\n<p>Left Click + Drag - highlight units<br/></p>\n<p>Ctrl + Left Click - command all selected units to move to and stay at cursor location</p>\n<p>R - command all selected units to resume standard behavior</p>\n\r\nMechanics:\r\n<p>- resource system: build resource factories on top of production centers to obtain the production center's resource, and use nodes to move the resources back to base<br/></p>\n<p>- custom unit building: adjust a tank's weapon, body, and engine to your liking (beware that more expensive units will also take longer to build)<br/></p>\n<p>- ammo system: units that run out of ammo (yellow bar) need to reload by moving near an ammo factory</p>\n<p>- dynamic enemies: be careful when building; enemies will be on high alert - the more you build, the stronger they will become (especially when building next to enemy factories)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Destroy all enemies and enemy factories while keeping your HQ alive to win.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>\r\nNotes and Closing Thoughts:\r\n</strong>\n<p>- currently there's no sound (may or may not go back and add some later)<br/></p>\n<p>- this game was inspired by the flash game Thanks Tanks; it tried to expand on a similar concept in allowing you to custom build tanks by choosing any combination of turrets, hulls, and wheels (not sure if it worked, but you be the judge of that)</p>\n<p>- not everything made it into the final cut, namely:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 * trucks were originally supposed to carry resources back to base (but were scrapped because of pathfinding difficulties)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 * there were supposed to be four weapons (cannon, autocannon, mortar, and flamethrower), but they were dropped to prevent the game from being more unnecessarily complicated<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0* the map was supposed to be twice as large, but there were difficulties getting the navigation to work correctly on such a large map<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This was made with Godot 3.4.4 in 17 days as an introduction to Godot and game design.</strong> While I have made a few small projects before, I consider this to be my first game (you might or might not have noticed from the janky mechanics). It's no masterpiece by any means, but it taught me some very important lessons.</p>\n<p>I hope you have as much fun playing this as I did making it. But if you don't, stay tuned - while this game may not be the best, it certainly won't be my last...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:44:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f21fdd214c46ca702d97a617791cf34f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Incognito_User"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
