Your only goal is to shoot the characters that run through the screen.<br/></p>\n<p>This project started as a intern joke among the T-bone team (Group that i'm part of as developer) and co-workers, but eventually we found a potential to develop it as a full game.<br/>The game is made of funny simulated cardboard 2D graphics, with a puppet theater theme that turns the game smooth and relaxing.<br/>During the game you'll find some power-ups that help you get more points in less time or slow down the characters.<br/>And do not forget to reload your ammo! Otherwise you'll let some character escape costing you your precious lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T02:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/574726f0d6d6c57856a5dc68dd8485e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edevjogos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
