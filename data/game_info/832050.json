This time the theme was <strong>Chrono</strong> and the limitation <strong>Only 3 buttons</strong>.</p>\n<p>All assets (3D models, animations, sound effects, scripts) were done during the Game Jam. The only thing that is not of my own are the fonts (Open 24 Display St.ttf, Quicksand_Book.otf and foptitles.ttf).</p>\n<p>Software used: Unity, Blender, Gimp, Audacity and sfxr.</p>\n<p>I implemented the theme (<strong>Chrono</strong>) by making the game setting in a clock sphere and having the Player moving around the circumference. The clock handle spawns little items at random intervals. These items represent different actions (i.e: work, party, sleep, eat).</p>\n<p>\u00a0The limitation (<strong>Only 3 buttons</strong>) is achieved by assigning Player movement to the left and right arrow keys and the jump action to the spacebar.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the screen there is a display showing the current time and what is the expected action to be done for that time. The Player will have to avoid picking up any other items but the one expected.</p>\n\n<p>Pick the corresponding item based on what the Activity is showing:</p>\n\n<p>When an item is picked, right or wrong, an hour passes by and the clock shrinks or grows by a ring until the 24 hours of a day are gone.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed the game. I wish I\u00a0had had time to add more levels and more items.</p>\n<p>Sergio Gardella</p>\n<p>www.sergiogardella.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T07:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd1683542b0f64c4509c49fb7dd959a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SergioGardella"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
