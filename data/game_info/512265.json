Your identity will be revealed if you touch a pumpkin or a ghost.\u00a0 Jump from platform to platform, use your special abilities and avoid obstacles in this medium to hard difficulty game in order to stay disguised until the end of halloween! Will you survive?</p>\n<p>From the developer:<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first game jam I've ever participated in and the first completed game I've ever made. Im really happy about how my game turned out and i hope you will like it too! I worked really hard about it and i hope it was worth it.\u00a0 This is the first game i have ever made so i would really appreciate it if you take that in mind when you rate my game. It still needs some improvements and a better name so i would be glad to see your ideas in the comments! :)</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Tileset: pzUH</p>\n<p>Music: Hadwin Channel</p>\n<p>Characters: Kenney</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/694b26638abef1fe18e9c14f956acde3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["P_john"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
