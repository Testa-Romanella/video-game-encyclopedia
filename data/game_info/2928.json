Collect all cars and upgrades to keep up with competition while you progress in career mode or have a quick race either against AI opponents or against friends. You can play up to 4 players locally and up to 8 players online. Go and build your own tracks, share them with friends or play with them in your tracks. Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends.<br/><br/>There are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use different cars depending on which type of event you're playing, because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are races! And if you grow tired of the tracks in the game you can always check what other tracks have the community built or even build your own and share it with our in-game track editor.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>16 different cars with unique handling models<br/></li><li>12 different tracks in 4 different locations which can be played in 5 different event types<br/></li><li>Career mode comprising 48 events<br/></li><li>Up to 4 player local multiplayer<br/></li><li>Up to 8 player online multiplayer<br/></li><li>Track editor to build and share your own tracks</li></ul>Early Access Roadmap<br/>We have a roadmap in place for the period the game is going to be in Early Access.
