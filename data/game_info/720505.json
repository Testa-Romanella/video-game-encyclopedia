In the Story Mode, you approach the stages one-by-one and experience the game's cutscenes and character dialogue, but in Arcade Mode, all breaks in the action are stripped away as you attempt to complete all stages consecutively.</p>\n<p>Important to the plot is a strange bell that absorbs magic when rung, which is reflected in the central gameplay mechanics. Ring bells to clear enemy fire and absorb gold and other bells- stacking bells together with lots of gold and bullet deletions will send your score into the stratosphere ... alternatively, leverage their magic-sealing properties to protect yourself!</p>\n<p>There are three difficulties in the game, Casual, Original and Super- which range from actively assisting the player with mechanics,\u00a0to being bitterly, insurmountably difficult. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This is an\u00a0<strong>early-access demo version\u00a0</strong>of the game. It will receive updates to graphics/textures, balance, and features, but the amount of gameplay content will remain three stages.</p>\n<p>Check out the soundtrack on Bandcamp:\u00a0https://lunacyindeterminate.bandcamp.com/album/praecantor-lila-bell-spell-origin...<br/></p><p>Join the community Discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/v9epA7jX7u</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:45:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/95859909d6d226a089d5c16e2dd7cf51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taizen Chisou"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
