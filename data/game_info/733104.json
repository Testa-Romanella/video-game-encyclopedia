By staring at your opponents as they approach you, you will slow down TIME and REALITY in order to gain an EDGE in your DUEL against multiple opponents. If you stare deeply enough into their souls with intense determination, time will slow down even further, allowing you to get an ultimate combo by BLOCKING with your proper Samurai/Bushido skills at the exact right time in order to deflect their attacks right as your opponents are about to attack you in rapid succession to the beat of the music and from multiple directions.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools And Technologies:\u00a0</strong><br/>.Net, Eye tracking equipment, Unity (any product), Virtual reality head mount display (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, etc.)<br/><br/>Tested on Vive Pro Eye Tracking, Valve Index, and Quest 2 Link.<br/><br/><strong>Installation Instructions:\u00a0</strong><br/>Must be played on a PC with a\u00a0SteamVR compatible headset with just a Right Controller to control the katana. Eye-tracking optional (will use head gaze instead if no eye-tracking is detected).<br/></p>\n<p>Make sure to have some space around you, to the forward, left, and right as the game encourages movement and swinging your sword at the opponents sword.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Richard Borys - Programmer / Gameplay Designer<br/>Eryk Silva - Designer /\u00a0Content</p>\n<p>Music Credits:<br/>RIC - \u967d\u3001\u51fa\u3065\u308b\u3002(Album: AD Japan)<br/>https://youtu.be/TIu7nAuh868<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:10:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf736b94eed8da4fbf1ee6f968d23a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hypothic"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
