Spatialized audio, 1'st predator = actual lose condition! woo</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I welcome any feedback or thoughts (below or on Twitter). \u00a0I'm not sure whether I'll take this further. \u00a0I have 2 projects in development as a 1-man Indie Dev Dad (I'm a full-time Dad) already so unless this gets rave reviews, I'll probably keep this as a happy memory :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 -- @Arakade</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2efce218c1957594f2946fe698710ef7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Arakade"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
