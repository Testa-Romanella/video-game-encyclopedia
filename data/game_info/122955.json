Wells' <em>The Time Machine, </em>the Time Traveller demonstrates his new invention by using a tiny scale model.  The model is a fully functioning time machine, but too small for anyone more than half a foot tall.  He sends it unmanned into the future... but what became of it?  </p><p>In my story, Wells' time machine found it's way to the land of Lilliput, described in Jonathan  Swift's Gulliver's Travels.  Lilliputians are \"Less\"-er folks to be sure; not only are they 1/12th-scale, but they're also a bit too prone to conflict.  Their use of the time machine lands them in a temporal catastrophe, a future where the Earth is tidally locked to the Sun, and there is no cycle of day and night, just a world in sunlight and one in shadow.  </p><p>Strange after-images and phantom lights show that the time distortion is still ongoing, even while the machine is off.  In a last-ditch attempt to escape the Dark Side of the Earth, the Lilliputian scientist tangles another timeline into his timeless purgatory, that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  </p><p>Holmes must drop his investigation of the man with the watches, and instead discover where (or rather, <em>when</em>) he is.<br/></p><br/><p><strong>Reassembled Scientist's Log</strong>(Spoilers!)</p><p><strong>Gameplay Video</strong><br/></p><p>- press X to start playing -<br/></p><p><strong>ARROWS</strong> : Walk</p><p><strong>CTRL</strong> <strong>+</strong> <strong>ARROWS</strong> : Run ( you can't collect clues while running)</p><p><strong>X</strong>: find/collect Clues (a Clue can be picked up an exclamation point is overhead), <strong>SHIFT</strong> to view after finding to enter <strong>Review Mode</strong> (<strong>Mouse/WASD</strong>, see below)</p><p><strong>C</strong>: light Match</p><p><strong>Z</strong>: arm(1st press) or fire(2nd press) Holmes' Webley Revolver.</p><p>NOTE: You only get 5 bullets, so use them wisely!<br/></p><p><strong>R to reset</strong> if you get stuck.</p><p>as you collect Clues, you can review and sort them by holding <strong>SHIFT </strong>to enter <strong>Review</strong> <strong>Mode</strong>.</p><p>While in <strong>Review Mode</strong> (holding <strong>SHIFT</strong>), you can <strong>Mouseover</strong> a Clue and press <strong>WASD</strong> to move that Clue around.

I'd thought using the mouse to drag and drop would be too easy, so I went with the WASD nudge system. I must remember that repetitive playtesting can give a dev distorted impressions of difficulty.</p><p>Also, there is a bug in Review Mode which makes it tough to sort notes unless you're standing in the Moonlight.
