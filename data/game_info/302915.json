When she regains consciousness, her young daughter is gone from the seat beside her. As the mother searches the adjoining woods, she comes to an abandoned house containing evidence of a mysterious tragedy that struck the family that lived there, and details about a strange fog that crept out of a nearby military base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat macabre threads tie these seemingly unrelated events into a single, terrifying story? To find out, play The Fog, a captivating hidden object game with more than a few surprises lurking along its misty paths. As you search the blood-smeared corridors of an empty hospital and the decayed remnants of a demolished military base, you'll search for useful items, solve cleverly designed puzzles, and play mini-games unlike any you have encountered. When fear threatens to overcome you, and you want to turn back, remember: the answer to the mystery lies within the haze.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tCaptivating storyline<br/>\r\n\u2022\tMind-blowing cinematics<br/>\r\n\u2022\tChallenging HOG scenes<br/>\r\n\u2022\tCleverly designed puzzles<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAtmospheric locations", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981591787130764441e5909ed4e0d99f.jpg", "website": "http://www.alawar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 59, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 555, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creobit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
