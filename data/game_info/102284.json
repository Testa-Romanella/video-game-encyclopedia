Was a game discovered in the crawl space under the crawl space right under the local goodwill. The video cassette and it's manual have been lying dormant waiting for an unsuspecting soul to prey on. That day has finally arrived. Peeling open the dusty pages of what suspiciously looks like an old algebra notebook reveals dark secrets. This video and it's notebook has the last kept record of communication with the dead. It was only a matter of time until this fell into the wrong hands... Yours. Don't think this instructional video doesn't come with a price...\r\n</p>\t\r\nThis game was developed for the 2016 Global Game Jam\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tAllen Michael-Brower - Programmer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tJosh Grilli - Lead Art/Animation\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCarson Mauthe - Music\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMint - Design/Programming\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSlend/Syn - Occult Consultant/Audio\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tJules - Art/Design\r\n</p>PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING! <p>This game does not require you to click the mouse in any capacity. To interact you must hold the mouse over an object when the interaction pointer is present. This game is more enjoyable when playing with 2 or more players with hands on the mice at the same time. Treat it like a ouija board of sorts. This game also uses a microphone at some points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9f/a9fe37817f312d6a226e09387aad056b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spacetronaut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
