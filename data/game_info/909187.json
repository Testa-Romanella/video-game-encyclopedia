Drag a strawberry to it to plant it. Click it when the new strawberries are red to pick them. At the end of a 30 second round your score is the number of\u00a0strawberries/strawberry plants x round. If a fly touches a strawberry plant it will disappear, so put a strawberry plant in its path to stop it.</p>\n<p>As you can tell, I didn't really have much time to finish it and it might not even run\u00a0(Java is messed up on my PC) but it DOES WORK if you can get it to run. If it doesn't run, I'll fix it later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31ab4d69be4b4b33b25cf44d7428b78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FarawayDrip30"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
