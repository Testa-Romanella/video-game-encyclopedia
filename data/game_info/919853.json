Gut instinct tells you she might be an alcoholic, but it's hard to find someone with factory shine, so caution is thrown to the wind as the day of the date comes. Besides, she's a catgirl, I mean, how often do you get to go on a date with a catgirl?</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Dating An Alcoholic Catgirl (DAAC) is still in development. <strong>This is a demo</strong>. The game rose from a joke between friends, and their support matched my motivation to make it happen. Right now, there is just two scenes, about 3,200 words, so it's very short.<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Affection / Drunkness meters - Lines and scenes might be different depending on how much of these bars are filled.<br/></p>\n<p>Choices - DAAC plays like a normal visual novel more than a dating sim, though some choices do matter in terms of filling the affection / drunk meter.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Stacy to be voiced by TinyDemon (@tinydemonremi).</p>\n<p>Everything else done by MallleDive (@mallledive).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T06:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e3260e9717745ead847157111ffeb25c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MallleDive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
