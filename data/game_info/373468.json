{"id": 373468, "slug": "river-rend", "name": "River Rend", "name_original": "River Rend", "description": "<p>This is a remake of classic Atari 2600 game River Raid. It tries to capture the essence of original's simple but elegant gameplay while lessening the drawbacks of 8-bit hardware. The visuals reinterpret original minimalist aesthetic in a pseudo-3D manner, keeping a strong semblance to the source.\u00a0 There are couple additions to the game mechanics; cumulatively exploding fuel pods that allow for some fun destructive tactics, destructible targets on land, and mega explosions of bridge checkpoints\u00a0that annihilate everything in the perimeter, including trees. In the original Atari game there were no tanks crossing bridges. Some versions on other platforms had them. It's a neat feature so I included it in the remake.</p>\n<p>The game runs in html canvas and was written using plain Javascript. So far it was somewhat\u00a0tested in Edge and Brave. It runs smoothly in Edge while there was some frame dropping\u00a0in Brave. Please report if you encounter any\u00a0bugs or performance issues. Thanks!</p>\n<p>The game was made from scratch in a week for a destruction-themed olcCodeJam2019.<br/>Difficulty ramping may need some tuning, so your feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Code, design &amp; graphics: Nenad Jal\u0161ovec<br/>Sound: LittleRobotSoundFactory<br/>Original game author: Carol Shaw<br/></p>\n<p>You can play original River Raid\u00a0in an online Atari 2600 emulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90d3452ef35d653ea45336a8cf125d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nenad2D"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
