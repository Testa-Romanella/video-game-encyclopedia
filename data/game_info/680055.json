Our goal is to pass on our love of Mystery, Challenge, and Creative Thinking through this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to the World of Ungezi, you find yourself in a small village filled with kind people but there isn\u2019t much to do. Throughout your years here, you have heard stories of Adventurers that would explore the vast unknown lands, catalog new species, and collect vast treasures for themselves. Could these stories be true, find out for yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave no worries though while you are away from Ungezi you will still explore the unknown biomes that lie ahead and be rewarded upon return. But beware your adventurer will still be out exploring while you are away so make sure to be equipped with your best gear.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T02:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f28248972a4d72c53dc72a29a49545.jpg", "website": "https://clickandslaystudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Click and Slay Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Click and Slay Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
