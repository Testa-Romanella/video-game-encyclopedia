The player has to chose wisely what to build, where and when.</p>\n<p>This game was made using the Unity Engine v5.3 in four months.</p>\n<p>The game comes with a state of the art document giving an overview of power grid simulations in game, real-life power plant types, and power consumption in the world.</p>\n<p>This project uses modified assets from game-icons.net that were released under CC BY 3.0 License.</p>\n<p>3D Models by Antoine Chassin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a2dfaa3cfb0aefa83e74ae369765ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thomas Chassin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
