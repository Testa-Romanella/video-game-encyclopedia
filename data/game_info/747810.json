I don't blame you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0As a wise man once said,\u00a0\"A tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.\" - Wikipedia<br/></p>\n\n<p>But in this game... the tree is an unstoppable force of nature! Throw birds at those darn lumberjacks and cut them up! Don't get chopped up by their chainsaws!
