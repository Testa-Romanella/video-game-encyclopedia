Greenscape is a 3D first person shooter game developed in the fall of 2020.\u00a0 In order to win, the player must traverse the hilly landscape and shoot bug-like enemies, eventually collecting keys and passing through buildings to arrive at a portal. The portal takes the player to the boss level where they then must defeat the Hive Queen in order to win. My responsibilities included creating the UI page, terrain textures, and skybox for this game with original art, but my primarily role included level design and the organization of the assets provided to me by MSU.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f1641c3c74c792089470769b0bd4fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nichi13"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
