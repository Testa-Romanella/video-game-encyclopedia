This was helped in major part due to the two huge deities, Sunblobs, carrying one sun each so the entire world can receive power at all times.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, one of the Sunblobs was dozing off, and let a meteor hit their sun, causing it to hit and break the central solar panel. Due to society's reliance on the sun, this causes a major power outage in that part of the world. Not only that, the impact also broke the sun, as it is only releasing one beam of light, and it needs time to charge back up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, one beam of light from the sun is enough solar energy to power Earth right back up. That's when the Sunblob asks an Engineer for help. If the Engineer can fix the central solar panel, power can easily come back.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately... the Engineer is a major scaredy-cat, as the dark makes normal things look scarier. He freezes up whenever in the dark and is stunned for a second, and then\u00a0needs to go back to the light as soon as possible. The Sunblob and Engineer need to work together to fix the central solar panel and light the way to victory!</p>\n<p>Something that may not be too obvious - sometimes the Sunblob needs to react quick when the Engineer is frozen and stunned.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Move - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Switch Control - Z, Space, Shift</p>\n<p>Grab - X, Down</p>\n<p>Continue Cutscene - Any Input</p>\n<p>Restart Current Level - R</p>\n<p>Hi, thanks for stumbling onto my game! This is the second game I've made, and I wanted to try my hand at a puzzle game and a game jam, so this is the perfect combination.</p>\n<p>I made this alone, and I definitely didn't anticipate how much work there would be! I wanted to expand this concept a little more with objects like\u00a0a split mirror, things that the Sunblob can use,\u00a0\u00a0etc, but I did not have enough time to add those in. I also really wanted to clean up the game (cut out the fat, make intended mechanics clearer, and fix a ton of\u00a0bugs)\u00a0and add in some music and sounds, but I did not have enough time to do those as well.\u00a0A lot of challenges and lessons were had. I also drew everything despite my obvious lack of artistic skills.</p>\n<p>But yea, to be honest this game was barely play tested and there are probably an huge number of bugs,\u00a0soooooo have fun!</p>\n<p>Well, thanks for reading all of this, and I hope you found the concept fun/interesting! This game definitely feels like I duct taped a bunch of things together, so hopefully it at least works for some people.</p>\n<p>Here's a quick playthrough of the game, to show the intended solutions of the puzzles.</p>\n<p>Software Used</p>\n<p>Godot, Tilesetter, Aseprite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d205a523339b85d914675da0f8f9f2fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gyaradomo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
