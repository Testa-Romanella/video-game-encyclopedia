I really enjoyed having to go deeper into the process of coding and figuring out Construct3's tools\u00a0 and physics system. I was able to create a cool simulation of a Lunar Landing and set values for fuel, scoring, and vertical velocity along the y-axis. I also added a landing draft effect at the pads so it looks like the thruster is kicking up smoke and gusting wind. Let me how I did in the comments and how accurate it feels to the original game or the real thing. Have fun and good luck astronaut.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T05:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed879ca15146462dfb5987ae28aaecb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The JL ZONE"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
