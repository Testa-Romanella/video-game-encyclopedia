The theme was \"Undead.\" Any resemblance to your favorite ghost story is strictly a matter of homage, or parody. :) <br/></p>\n<p>I chose a classic Game Boy color palette, and went with a simple stealth gameplay. If I ever build this out to a bigger game, I have a few ideas about what I'd redo and what I'd add...<br/>This was my first game jam! It was somewhat harrowing, especially when my builds kept breaking and/or displaying new bugs. Enjoy. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T07:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d68412fdb661a100cb6b80aed04f4a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FallingWallGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
