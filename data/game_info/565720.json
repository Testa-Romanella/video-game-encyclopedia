{"id": 565720, "slug": "goblin-puncher", "name": "Goblin Puncher", "name_original": "Goblin Puncher", "description": "<p>This is a game about Punching Goblins with your sword. It started out as a Superhero game in a medieval setting but it ended up becoming what it is now, with leftovers from the Superhero theme(Flying and Invulnerability).<br/>You can Run around with WASD, left shift to move faster. Press the F key to fly around. Space to jump if you want. Left Click for Attack. ESC for Pause Menu.\u00a0Because it is my first 3D Game I have worked on completely, hit boxes are pretty jank, and so it would have been unfair to include Player Health. Sorry.<br/><br/>Help the female villager and defeat the goblins. After a certain amount of Goblins punched, the big bad will show up to fight! Other than that, run around fly around and just have fun!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Big Thanks to Jake Gamelin for providing the Music and Sound Effects!!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Find him over on: https://twitter.com/CharaComposer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T06:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba10b1ef66aed2e722162f3e56843aa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ursine_Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
