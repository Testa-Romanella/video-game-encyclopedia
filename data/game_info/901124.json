Hope you enjoy! \u2764</p>\n<p>This game was created with the idea of supporting two players. One uses the keyboard to drive a car; dodging obstacles and picking up cards. The other uses the mouse and organises cards on an overlay.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to remain alive long enough to gain score.</p>\n<p>Cards can be combined in the overlay to provide different effects (the card order isn't important):<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>A+B</strong>: Shielded from obstacles for 5 seconds.</li><li><strong>B+C:</strong> Gain one extra health.</li><li><strong>C+A:</strong> +15,000 score.</li></ul>\n<p>The game ends if the health in the top-left runs out. Health is lost by:</p>\n<ul><li>Hitting obstacles.</li><li>Having two cards of the same type in the MIX card slots.</li><li>Hitting a card when both MIX slots are full.</li></ul><p><strong>What's Missing:<br/></strong></p><ul><li>Music + SFX</li><li>More reactive animations/effects</li><li>Some art (car, health bar, etc.)</li><li>More in-depth strategy for the mouse player/component</li></ul><p><strong>Known\u00a0Issues<br/></strong></p><ul><li>Score increases inconsistently\u00a0(so the\u00a0score\u00a0boost\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0<strong>a\u00a0lot</strong>)</li><li>Ending the game on full MIX slots makes the cards disappear suddenly</li><li>Some of the card dragging is inconsistent (especially from the HOLD slot?)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b278450019199d11966812283cb5cef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jepp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
