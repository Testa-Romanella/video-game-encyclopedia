When our hero, <strong>Pizza Kidd</strong>\u2014the player controlled character\u2014runs over an ingredient (sauce, cheese, pepperoni, onion, etc.), it drops to the platform below it, causing a series of reactions to one another and so on. (sound familiar?)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A special pizza is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the ladder laden labyrinth and into the deep dish pan located at the base of the level. Once all pizzas have been made, the game level is complete; the player moves on to the next...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>While prepping the pizzas, <strong>Kidd</strong> must avoid a variety of nuisance enemies: Pesky Pink Pigs (The Oinks), Blue Bird Beaks (Kaori), and Mr. Flame (watch out... he's hot!). Sadly, seafood isn't too happy to be\u00a0on the menu at this pizza shop, so be warned!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Run, Kidd! Run!</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Enemies can be avoided by ascending and descending ladders. Sprinkle them with bursts of garlic to stun them. Crush 'em with a falling ingredient, or drop 'em by luring them onto an ingredient...\u00a0Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the stage after a few seconds. Rack up a\u00a0high score by drawing\u00a0more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it to its death. Earn bonus points by picking up 1-ups and more!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Kidd has GARLIC bursts to spray on nearby enemies and plenty of\u00a0DOUGH BOMBS for when things get a little TOO HOT. Kidd loves extra garlic on his pizza, so grab more\u00a0by consuming bonus foods, such as Angela's Enchanted Espresso or Kidd Famous French Fries, which may appear in the center of the maze once the player has collected all (8)\u00a0of their pizza coins.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>What good is a pizza party without rockin' music? Enjoy\u00a0several levels\u00a0of pumping grooves and\u00a0puzzling difficulty\u00a0with even more pizzas and more enemies to defeat as you go. Now let's get cookin!\"<br/><em><strong>Feel the rhythm, avoid the swine, come on ya'll, It's Pizza Time!</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p>\u2022 Development / Levels: <strong>Raging Slime</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 Design / Concept / Pixels:\u00a0<strong>Drumat!c (Kdp)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p>\u2022 SFX Design:\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Mordi</strong> \u2014\u00a0https://mordimusic.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 Pixel Illustration:\u00a0<strong>Olvyanda</strong> \u2014\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/olvyanda_ariesta</p>\n<p>\u2022 Pixel Enemy / Boss:\u00a0<strong>Ren\u00e9</strong> \u2014\u00a0https://appsandmojo.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 Music: <strong>Kevin Ripley</strong> \u2014\u00a0https://kevinripley.bandcamp.com/album/three-changes</p>\n<p>______<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd Games, LLC:\u00a0</strong>www.pizzakidd.com<br/>Itch.io \u2014\u00a0https://kiddgamesllc.itch.io/<br/>Twitter \u2014\u00a0https://twitter.com/KiddPizza\u00a0<br/>IG \u2014\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/pizzakidd_thegame</p>\n<p><em>pizza.kidd.eats @ gmail.com</em></p>\n<p>For Leo &amp; Caiden!<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"Special Thanks to our favorite arcade developers\u00a0and all of the indie/retro gamers in the world.\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f222053f11e84c35534909ab64ba9e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RagingSlime"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
