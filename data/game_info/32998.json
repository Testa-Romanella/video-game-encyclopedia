Both builds are running on DOSBox with a custom configuration tool. The Enhanced build features fixes introduced in EGwhaven, a must-have community project, which addresses an array of bugs and issues with the game (we'd like to thank ETTiNGRiNDER for the contribution to this release). Additionally, the controls are re-mapped to what you'd expect to see as a default in a first-person game nowadays.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T04:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c864c7c01d85fe8be54d32763f29ba_e7HsDqw.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 62, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 579, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Capstone", "Capstone Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": ["SNEG", "Capstone"], "esrb_rating": null}
