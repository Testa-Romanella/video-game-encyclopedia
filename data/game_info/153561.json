The goal of the game is to last as long as possible in the spinning arena and to gather points (and extra time) by only touching walls of the same colour that your little robot currently is. It is a two player game where the first player controls his robot using the Arrow keys and the second player uses WASD to move his robot around. You should also try to avoid letting your robots touch. Press \"Space\" to restart. Alt + F4 to close the game. <br/><br/>Made by Malte Burup &amp; Ludwig Sandbacka </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/36185c8a6d1c5e7dd110a363a0f26290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luuds"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
