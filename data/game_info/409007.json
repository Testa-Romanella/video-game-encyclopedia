Fix further down the description</li></ul>\n<p>The game is quite simple: You steer a small drill vessel with the WASD or arrow keys. You should also be able to use an XBox controller if you want.\u00a0\u00a0There are two meters to watch: Health and fuel. Former reduces as you fall from to far heights, second depletes over time. To refuel, simply drive over the \"Hub\", the only building seen in the game. This is also where you can buy upgrades for money by pressing E (A on XBox).\u00a0\u00a0This is the basic game, in case things are unclear (which they probably are) I will extend this description further.</p>\n<p><strong>MAC OPENING</strong></p>\n<p>Since this is not my main focus rn, there is no fix for the problem atm. Anyhow, if for some reason the game will not open on mac, you can right click it, show contents and then Contents-&gt;MacOS-&gt; and run Drill\u00a0Deeper from there. If you have the latest java version installed it should work now. I will try to look into fixing this soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T04:30:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/20370e61d31fcc54cba768f28f13ebe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["EpoGenesis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
