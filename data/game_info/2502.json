The two control methods are nice, the animation is fluid, and the gameplay is addictive. If you haven't seen the video, basically gameplay involves skating through various areas, pulling off tricks and picking up tokens for points. There is plenty of challenge in the game, so those 24 levels should keep you occupied for a while. <br/><br/>Definitely one not to pass up.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a588d10af114660268737f1d5e2c5270.jpg", "website": "http://www.turbochilli.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Traction Games", "Turbo Chilli"], "genres": ["Sports", "Family"], "publishers": ["Turbo Chilli Pty Ltd trading as Traction Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
