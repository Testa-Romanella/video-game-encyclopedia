You should use\u00a0the tiles and merge them\u00a0to make a safe path to the sleepwalker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is 6 levels and 2 game modes, the \"planning mode\" that you can pause de game to make the path, or the \"real time mode\" that you can't.</p>\n<p>I recommend play in planning mode to get the mechanics, than go to the real time mode to experience de real intention of the game.</p>\n<p>This game was made in Construct 2. Almost all assets was made by me, except the hand in the cursor and the font used in the interface. But, in the future i intend to make everything hand drawn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d468258a6737d694c06e8871eb5c40d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BrunoGatCar"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
