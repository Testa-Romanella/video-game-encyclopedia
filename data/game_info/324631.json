I'll be keeping the game as updated as possible as I add more things to it. The menu screens are placeholders at the moment and some sprites will definitely be changed as time progresses. I would like as much constructive feedback as possible so if I need to I can change things as early as possible. I hope you enjoy the game and please leave a comment telling me your experience of the game, Thank You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1bfc7d878f12966ba6fcb4ea619ce03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["After These Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
