It is designed for mobile Virtual Reality, but it works really well on PC and Mac.\u00a0Though it does not yet do virtual reality on these platforms, it does bring the bulk of that experience to your home computer.</p>\n<p>Following the story of a group of spirits preforming the funerary rites for a planet, Encompassed engages you with interesting puzzles in 3D space, and culminates in conflict with the wandering and restless dead.</p>\n<p>Encompassed borrows from predecessors in other mediums, with an immersive adaptive soundtrack, mysterious levels, and tutorials built into the game which are designed to not break the immersion. It is truly the first great mobile virtual reality atmospheric puzzler (or MVRAP for short ) which you can experience on your own computer, albeit without the VR capability for now.</p>\n<p>On this page, Encompassed will be free until our release date, on February 20th, 2018. At which point it will change to a paid game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd229eed52ff2f61acf97eaa29c2758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DropEverythingGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
