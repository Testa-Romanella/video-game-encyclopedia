The art was created by physically doing a bit of lino printing, scanning the textures, and then creating a collage in photoshop. The sprites were drawn by hand with pencil and paper, before scanning, and going over in photoshop, reducing it to three colours (black, 50%grey, white) to stand out against the noisy backgrounds. The music was made by running a three chord sequence through an arpeggiator, playing a simple bassline over the top, and then distorting everything with filters/reverb/a pitch shift. Super simple, but the first time m11 has supplied music in a jam situation.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/855a030cddf06fedbf606f9c5ae3419f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["All the bees", "m11"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
