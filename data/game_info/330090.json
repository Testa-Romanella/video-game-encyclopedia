Let's see how this works out for you.</p>\n<p>Printable world map:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-9d8MZCrX5cdGBQ0LVlgSxD2lK6vp_zd</p>\n<p><strong>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/btco/so12l</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SAVEGAME WARNING</strong>: Depending on your browser, the save game feature might not work (known issue on some Chrome versions)!
