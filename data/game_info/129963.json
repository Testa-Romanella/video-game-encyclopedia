It started out with the idea of playing as a thorned plant which has to avoid touching other creatures and hurting them. At some point I decided to cut off the thorns because after having some friends play it, I thought the gameplay was too frustrating. Looking back at it now, I think that's one of the reasons why I lost interest in the project after a while; I traded away the core concept for a less frustrating experience, which sadly was also less meaningful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df3433c47c1180f6c21af5b9e0a7835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josia Roncancio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
