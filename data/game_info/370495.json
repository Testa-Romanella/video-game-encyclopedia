One day, the gravity field created on his earth malfunction, but he was prepared! Help Eli get to the spaceship that will bring him to safety.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The closer you are to the ground, the less \"gravity\" there is, and the further you are the more the \"gravity\".\u00a0The bar on the top is a timer which will restart the game when it runs out, and if Eli falls towards the sky the game will restart.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/747f11785e1785346195f923a43d5a9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["freakofif"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
