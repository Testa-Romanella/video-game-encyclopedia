Armed with nothing more than a dash and a hunger for survival, fend off the beasts that desire to slice you up and put you on a platter. In this boss rush game, you are confined in a small enclosed space, and you must weave around the boss and their many attacks, and wait for an opportunity to retaliate.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Three Unique And Challenging Enemies</h3>A miner from deep underground, a sheriff from far in the desert, a ghost king on a floating graveyard, and more to come... Challenge three difficult bosses, and die trying. Each boss has a range of different moves, and a completely different fighting style. Learn their movesets, and work your way to eventually defeating them.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Difficulty Settings For All Gamers</h3>Fight and master the bosses in 3 different difficulty modes, and compete to beat them all with the least amount of deaths possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T05:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a575dc1419010b74c04f47970f2e6cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zach Hsu"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zach Hsu"], "esrb_rating": null}
