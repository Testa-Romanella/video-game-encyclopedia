Thus, after 75 days of coding and bothering some of my friends, Iaid\u00f4 Masters was born. The main design idea for this game was the need for understanding the really basics of Fighting Games: \"is all about the footsies\", as pros say. I always have struggled with Fighting Games but I do love their\u00a0 complexity so I wanted to create a Fighting Game where mind-games and reflexes had more weight in the overall formula than style or executtion. I don't know if I have\u00a0100% succeeded on this task but I do think I have learned a lot about the genre and I'm proud with the overall result. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The main sources of inspiration for this game are: <strong>Samurai Shodown</strong> <strong>series</strong>, <strong>Divekick </strong>and <strong>Sekiro's</strong> fas paced combat system. <br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this little game as much as I enjoyed the process of creating it!</p>\n<p>Carlos P.
