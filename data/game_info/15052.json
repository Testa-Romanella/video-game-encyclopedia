Their only way out is to navigate through 100 deviously dangerous levels... <br/><br/><br/><br/>...which is where you come in! The Wizards Who Fell In A Hole is a one- or two-player platform game in which each player controls a wizard who can jump and shoot at a variety of monsters, with the aim being to kill all monsters on a level before progressing. <br/><br/><strong>There are special items to give you various power-ups and help you along the way, and lots of tasty food to be eaten to rack up the high scores and extra lives.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9334e32680606d72f33fbc627b72d56d.jpg", "website": "http://www.battenbergsoftware.com/games/twwfiah/twwfiah.aspx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Battenberg Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OtakuMaker.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
