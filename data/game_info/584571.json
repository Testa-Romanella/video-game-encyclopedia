Go through events, fight pirates, and gather more crew as you make your way to your destination. <br/></p>\n<p>There are currently 4 events and a whole lot of pirates to fight, I hope to add many more.<br/></p>\n<p>If you make it to the end, I commend your effort, but I didn't have time to set up the final event. I hope to add more content as I have time available.
