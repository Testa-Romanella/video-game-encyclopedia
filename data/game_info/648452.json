Pieces must be touching.\u00a0 Minimum word length is 3 letters. Then submit your word by right clicking.</p>\n<p>A selected piece can be unseleccted by left clicking it again. Or clear all selected pieces by clicking the middle mouse button.</p>\n<p>A piece can be flipped to a random letter by rolling the scroll wheel forwards or pressing \"F\" when hovering over the piece.</p>\n<p>All the pieces can be shuffled by rolling the scroll wheel backwards or pressing \"S\".</p>\n<p>Use flips and shuffles sparingly, you only start with 3 of each, but can earn more as your score increase.</p>\n<p>Letters are scored like scabble, but the the total\u00a0is multipied by the word length - so longer words are worth finding!</p>\n<p>Your highscore is saved - you find that it will increase dramatically as you practise!</p>\n<p>Thanks to Fergus Griggs for the artwork for the pieces!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a65c9b7e4c70cbdaba3afba84e722d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerdyTurkey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
