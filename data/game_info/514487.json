{"id": 514487, "slug": "mummy-knocks", "name": "Mummy knocks", "name_original": "Mummy knocks", "description": "<p>I made this game for Curdle Jam #7, 2020. The theme of the jam was \"opportunity knocks.\" </p>\n\n<p>The game has two levels, which you can choose in the beginning. There also is a video tutorial. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Instructions:<br/></p>\n<p>Steering with w,a,s,d, space to jump or open the chest while touching it, hit \"h\" to return to the menu.\u00a0 One of the chests contains a key, which can unlock the door to freedom. The \"good chest\" with the key makes a knocking sound every 12 seconds. The closer you are to the chest, the louder the knocking gets. You will have to walk around and listen, but be very afraid of the Mummy! If it hits you, you die. It gets faster and faster! Luckily, you have a taser that you can use once (!) to slow down the Mummy. Aim at the Mummy and click the left mouse button to make it freeze and go back to its initial speed. <br/></p>\n<p>Once you click your left mouse button, the taser disappears, so use it wisely! If you open the \"wrong\" chest without the key, you die! Once you find the key, you need to find the door to freedom and walk through it, and you will be safe!<br/></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements: The mummy asset is from a previous game I made. Check it out on my developer site, if you like! Big thanks for the music to Turamon.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun and survive!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T07:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe00badc44cee25a7cd2d496bedf8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itchy_programmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
