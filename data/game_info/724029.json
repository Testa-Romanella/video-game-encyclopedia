This game has in development since May 2020. My prediction is to finish in 2022. I have been a gamedev for 6 years and worked in other indie games like Room 404 (PC), BlackIris (PC), Eternal Soldier (Mobile) and Volcan Defend the Tower (PC). Due to the pandemic, I am developing the game by myself at home.<br/><br/>I want to create fun and challenging gameplay for Elementite, but for that I need constant feedback from the community that is interested in this type of game. I will always be active on social networks sharing with everyone each new implementation of the game looking for opinions, ideas, and help to test.<br/><br/>Hope you like it.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>https://discord.com/invite/hRX46mA</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d42df3106c7df35d9a0b91d11bf4da3.jpg", "website": "https://bussinessprocessor.wixsite.com/elementite", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 604, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danilo Solo Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mayflower Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
