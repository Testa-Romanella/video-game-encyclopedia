Online and enemy bots are in-development, but currently, to get the full experience, 2-4 players will be needed, as well as a controller for each player.</em></strong><strong>\u00a0<em>A single keyboard-mouse combo\u00a0can take the place of one controller.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Project Scrapper</strong>\u00a0is a casual first-person objective shooter with one caveat: players have no guns. Instead, players are equipped with an anti-gravity jump that lets them jump onto and run along surfaces and gravitational rivets that draw objects together. The wide applicability of these rivets allow players to employ whatever strategies they come up with. Launch environmental objects at opponents to knock them down or launch your opponents themselves. Use the rivets to keep objective items from other players. In some game modes, players can even rip the panels composing the map. Make gravity your play thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight against other players in several game modes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Scrapmatch - Deathmatch with a Project Scrapper twist where players destroy the map to knock each other out. Rip the panels out of the wall and force an enemy through the holes to knock them out. Last player standing wins.</li><li>Treasure Trove - Gather as many cubes as possible in your trove or steal cubes from other players. The more cubes, the faster your score goes up</li><li>Classic Capture the Flag - Capture the flag, as you know it, but nothing is typical in Project Scrapper. Even the\u00a0flag \"Mizkin Test Retrieval Objects\" are affected by rivets, allowing for weaponization or remote transport.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Play in maps with game mechanics specific to each</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Cube - A standard map (or as standard as it is in Project Scrapper) where the cube in the center affects the gravitational pull of everything surrounding it</li><li>Solar (still in development)\u00a0- Jump from planet to moving planet, dodging block storms and avoiding the incineration at the hands of the sun (Darwin bots are durable, but not <em>that</em> durable)</li><li>Dance Club \u00a0(still in development)\u00a0- Packed full of colors and environmental objects with a non-open layout. Warp the map and create new entry points or just jump your way throughout the map</li><li>Game Board \u00a0(still in development)\u00a0- Play on an oversized, tiled game board. Each tile has unique functions. Start a wildfire in the grasslands or use pirahna tiles to launch flying death with your rivets</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/301942e8693bcd3869a55aa3a8b4b193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["buggydarwin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
