Check out this guys stuff if you get a chance! Incredible stuff\u00a0https://m.soundcloud.com/sebastian_whyte</p>\n<p><strong>***QUICK NOTE***</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Had a difficult time with posting this game in HTML browser for some reason. I had some cutscenes that had to be cut to work on HTML. If you want the definitive\u00a0</strong><strong>version and want to\u00a0play the\u00a0game the way it was intended please try the downloadable file version! The downloadable game has the cutscenes that work (I think\u00a0I did Windows correct, but I know I did Mac right and the cutscenes work). If you don't care about the cutscenes, the HTML has the core game mechanics! I mean it's\u00a0Really only two cutscenes that last a total of maybe 1- 2 minutes, but I worked hard on those cutscenes and I want you to\u00a0enjoy my hard work\u00a0dangit!!!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Enjoy this awesome game that was created during the Scream Jam 2020. Had an awesome time with it! Tried several new things with this gam jam for the first time including cutscenes, using scriptable objects, I made a game trailer for the jam! Our music man made some incredible music! Really proud of what we were able to accomplish with this game. I know the animations on the main character are a little goofy and I would have liked to have added more decorations to the house and more enemies to the house, but you know... Time! Still learning just like everyone else. Hope you enjoy the game! rate it and tell us what you like!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e5eee3b99c53e146002f95fb45bbd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dice099"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
