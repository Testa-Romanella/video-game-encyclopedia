It is your duty to survive the night <strong>identifying and exterminating</strong> the threat at hand. Use paranormal detection equipment such as <strong>thermometers, cameras, and EMF readers</strong> to find out <strong>what kind of entity</strong> you are dealing with from up to <strong>6 different</strong> kinds of <strong>ghosts</strong>, or <strong>mythical creatures</strong> such as the <strong>Wendigo</strong>. Perform <strong>S\u00e9ances to speak to the entity</strong>, and complete different <strong>immersive rituals</strong> to send whatever has been haunting you it <strong>back from where it came</strong>.<br/><br/>When dealing with a Cryptid or mythical creature the tone of the game changes, no longer is your focus on investigation. Now you are only looking to survive and defeat the cryptid. It is always on the hunt and it will take much more than luck to survive an encounter.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Voice Recognition:</strong> Use your own voice to speak to the entity through a s\u00e9ance and ask for it to do different actions to prove its existence.<br/></li><li><strong>Survive:</strong> The only way to live through the night terror and wake up in the morning is for you to exterminate the threat at hand. The experience can be calmer or more intense based on the entity that you are dealing with in that session.<br/></li><li><strong>Rituals:</strong> After you are confident about what kind of entity you are dealing with its time for you to take matters into your own hands and banish it for good. Draw out the ritual circle using salt and other sacred items and follow the steps to complete the ritual in banishing the entity for good. But be careful choosing a ritual that does not effect the entity will only anger it more.<br/></li><li><strong>No One Left Out:</strong> 6 player co-op makes it easier than ever to get more friends involved in the frightening fun!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><strong>Use Ritual Charts</strong> to find which <strong>evidence</strong> leads to <strong>the entity you are facing</strong><br/>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><ul><li><strong>Moves Objects:</strong> The entity may try to scare you into leaving by <strong>throwing objects across the room</strong>, careful where you step...<br/></li><li><strong>Bloody Rooms:</strong> An entity may leave a <strong>bloody puddle</strong> in a room you have been in before, a sure sign that bad things are to happen if you continue to stay in its presence.<br/></li><li><strong>Disrupting Technology:</strong> Some entities have more pent up energy than others, this can disrupt the electromagnetic field and <strong>cause electronics to malfunction</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>EMF Level 5:</strong> If you are dealing with a particularly powerful entity you can experience an <strong>EMF reading of level 5</strong> you may want to <strong>hide somewhere safe and keep quiet</strong> if it ever gets to this point.<br/></li><li><strong>Hand Prints:</strong> Entities are sometimes able to leave <strong>bloody handprints</strong> around the environment, but something about them does not seem right.<br/></li><li><strong>Spirit Orbs:</strong> Entities that have a harder time showing themselves at first will sometimes display <strong>orbs unable to be seen</strong> by your naked eyes. Use a <strong>night vision camera</strong> to see what your eyes cannot.<br/></li><li><strong>Speaks:</strong> Entities that <strong>cannot possess you</strong> at any time may <strong>need to be let in willingly by using a s\u00e9ance</strong>. Though this method can prove to be <strong>quite deadly</strong> if you willingly <strong>let your guard down to a more powerful possessive entity</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>Motion Sensors:</strong> Even if you cannot always see an entity there are tools that you can use to find out where it might be. Using a <strong>motion sensor</strong> can prove to be quite useful in this situation. However <strong>some entities are able to avoid detection</strong>, if you are dealing with this kind of entity we wish you luck.<br/></li><li><strong>Temperatures Below 0:</strong> Entities may sometimes <strong>bring down the ambient temperature</strong> in an environment with their presence, <strong>not every entity is able to</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>Possession:</strong> There are entities that are <strong>able to take control of you at any point in time</strong>. These are the most dangerous, as they will <strong>use your own body to commit acts of murder</strong>. Using a <strong>crucifix may help rid the entity from your body</strong>. </li></ul>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3c94a081b8060f83ef4709c9badd65.jpg", "website": "https://antlercrew.weebly.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antler"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Antler"], "esrb_rating": null}
