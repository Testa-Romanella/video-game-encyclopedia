The problem is - these potions are incredibly volatile when not mixed properly. You're not familiar with a lot of these plants - so you'll have to refer to your predecessor's notes to know what to add to each potion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You'll mix colors and ingredient attributes to create potions of questionable morals, but hey - witches gotta eat too.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Note: Be sure to read the item descriptions!\u00a0The descriptions offer clues as to which ingredient to use in what potions. If you see the word \u201cattract\u201d in the description, then try using that ingredient in a love potion. Try\u00a0<em>Hexing</em>\u00a0someone with a \"psychedelic\" ingredient. Etc.<br/>\n</p><ul><li>I recommend starting with Puzzle Mode, as it acts as a tutorial for the mechanics as well</li><li>Click and drag ingredients into the cauldron.</li><li>Right click to read ingredient descriptions for hints on which to choose.</li><li>Combine colors to make new colors! You have 4 colors to work with: Red, Blue, Yellow, and White. Mix and match them to fit the recipe.</li><li>These potions are incredibly volatile, if you mess up it may just blow up in your face!</li></ul>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>F1 - Fullscreen toggle</p>\n<p>Left-Click - drag items</p>\n<p>Right-Click - open item descriptions</p>\n<p>Left/Right Arrow - show more ingredients</p>\n<p>Esc - Close window</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa7feba541a58d81dde6d8fe00ca55a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Deprecat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
