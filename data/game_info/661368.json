{"id": 661368, "slug": "hilt-ii", "name": "Hilt II", "name_original": "Hilt II", "description": "<p>A turn-based strategy game for Amiga &amp; Amiga emulators. I originally released this game in 1994.</p>\n<p>Hilt II is\u00a0squad level strategy game, a sequel of sorts to the dungeon game Hilt, but more like my earlier game Taskforce in gameplay. Take a team of elite soldiers and choose a mission like blow up some reactors, or steal secret plans. Kit them out with weapons and equipment, and take turns to explore the map and fight the enemies. Maps can be fixed or random. Many of the gameplay elements and maps were re-used for my first PC game, Arcangel (1999), and much later, the PC game Taskforce which was remastered for Steam in 2020.</p>\n<p>As with Hilt, the graphics were created by Andrew Cashmore.</p><p>The Hilt II Level Editor is also supplied. File operations crash when running from a single floppy because it needs the reqtools.library, but the RP9 file contains a pre-installed version of the editor on virtual hard drive running Workbench 3.1.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a65714e208639e803e3984f406fc6e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
