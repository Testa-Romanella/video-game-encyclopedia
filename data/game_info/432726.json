Fullness of your stomach represents your health so if you eat any food, your health increases. Some food have special powers such as coke for defence shield and kebab for speeding up also hamburger is currency in the game. You can buy hats with hamburgers :)\u00a0 \u00a0 .Besides you get old however it doesn't affect something.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Hold you finger on left and right to move the character or you can turn gyroscope\u00a0 mode by pressing button on right bottom corner.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I used Unity3D 5.3.4 and probably photoshop. The project was done in 2015-2016 however I wasn't using itch.io. Today I found apk and source files so wanted to upload. There was ads and iap but google deleted\u00a0the game from store therefore there would be problem with some buttons. By the way, I made 2 musics for this game. It was my first experiment with music making.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e25f056bedfbfd17a0532192cfcb051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cenullum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
