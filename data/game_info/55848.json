The game was released in Brazil in 1995 and in Europe on December 8, 1995, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It was also ported by Eurocom Entertainment Software to the SNES and released in North America in November 1996, in Europe on November 28, 1996, and in Japan on December 20, 1996.

It was ported one last time to the Game Boy by Bonsai Entertainment Corp., released in North America in August 1998.<br />\nThe Sega Mega Drive version was only released in Brazil and Europe, apart from an American release on the Sega Channel. The game was one of the first games to be released under the Disney Interactive Studios label.<br />\nThe game premiered for the North American market at Walt Disney World in September 1996. Three Maui Mallard kiosks were prepared in the Disney Interactive exhibit at the Innoventions plaza of EPCOT. Visitors could play the full game for an unlimited period of time and interact with Attractions Hosts and Hostesses who were available to play against them and share tips and tricks.<br />\nThe game stars Donald Duck in a metafictional role as duck detective Maui Mallard, who adopts the name &quot;Cold Shadow&quot; when he dresses up in ninja garb. For the North American versions of the game, all Donald Duck references are omitted for unknown reasons and the main character is only known as Maui Mallard. Though the end of the game informed the player to look forward to Maui&#39;s next adventure, there have been no other appearances of Maui Mallard or Cold Shadow in any medium.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-09T09:26:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e441a177855ad6e76bded673dd00b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Genesis", "PC", "Game Boy", "SNES"], "developers": ["Disney Interactive Studios", "Disney Interactive", "Eurocom Entertainment Software", "Bonsai Entertainment"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Capcom", "Nintendo", "Disney Interactive", "Tec Toy", "Sunsoft", "Tectoy", "BRA"], "esrb_rating": null}
