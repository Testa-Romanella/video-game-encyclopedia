{"id": 89796, "slug": "wordhawk", "name": "WordHawk", "name_original": "WordHawk", "description": "WordHawk is an exciting new word game, that mixes the fun of word searches with the challenge of completing puzzles.  Easy to learn, yet challenging to play, WordHawk is the next 'must have' game for your iPhone or iPad.<br/><br/>Puzzles are completed by placing the puzzle pieces onto the letter grid in the correct positions, so that the letters in each puzzle piece spell out a word.  When a piece is placed, the letters in the spelt word are removed from the grid, and the remaining letters drop down to fill any empty spaces.  This means that often, puzzle pieces must be placed in the correct order to complete a puzzle.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>The puzzle pieces are displayed beneath the letter grid and can be dragged into place.  Puzzle pieces may need to be rotated, before they will correctly spell out a word.  The puzzle pieces are colour coded, to show you the order of the letters in the word the piece represents.  The first letter in the word will start at the white square, the second letter will be in the lightest blue square, through to the last letter being in the darkest blue square.<br/><br/>If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can use hints to help you progress.  When you request a hint, the next piece to be completed in the puzzle is shown.  If you request another hint, that puzzle piece is then rotated to the correct rotation so that it is ready to be placed.  If you run out of hints, you have the option to purchase more within the game.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the game.<br/>Dan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b7826cba7007bbe4dcb295e7777adf35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daniel MILLWOOD"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
