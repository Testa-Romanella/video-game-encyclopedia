You should always look to upgrade your weapons to higher rarity versions. The rarities are (from worst to best): Common (grey) Uncommon (green) Rare (blue) Epic (purple) Legendary (gold) Mythic (red)\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Different weapon types will zoom out your screen more or less, controlling how much you can see around you. Snipers zoom your screen out the furthest, so when walking around outdoors always have your Sniper Rifle equipped.\u00a0 If you're low on ammo, pick up a gun with that ammo type and drop it again. The ammo will be transferred from the gun to your stocks.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Different weapons fire bullets at different speeds. Learn each weapon's bullet velocity, because it tells you how far to lead with your shots (shoot where your opponent is going to be, rather than where they are). Make sure also to be unpredictable in your movements during a fight so you're not an easy target.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5cb13fe8aaf1b70dac83ed33e05078e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperCanon20"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
