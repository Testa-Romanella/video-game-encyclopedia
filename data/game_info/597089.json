Shelley was a cool little fella. He loved his work as a hauler of crates. Day in, day out he would drag about, and selling the gems he had made. But then one day, Shelldon wailed and screamed, he had dropped his favorite rock, or so it seemed\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>His pickaxe he took, the big driller shook and Shelldon would just continue to look and look\u2026 His rock had gone missing, this turtle was hissing and then just began beating his chest.\r\n</p>\n<p>His protective vest was donned for the rest and suddenly Shelldon was smashing.\r\n</p>\n<p>The driller did plummet, he could not outrun it, so into the crates he was bashing\u2026 Oh boy what a muck\u2026 He ran out of luck. Could you perhaps help him find his rock?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The dreamlo leaderboard is only working in the standalone version.
