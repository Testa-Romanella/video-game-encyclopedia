P to pause.</p>\n<p>Full screen is recommended.</p>\n<p>This is a simple game where you must avoid the basketballs and survive as long as possible. This game may look like it was made in a weekend, but it actually took weeks mostly because I was experimenting with animation and the player controller. The goal of this project was to make a game that looks and feels good to play, with less focus on the actual gameplay. Have fun!</p>\n<p>Created by: Luke Haggerty</p>\n<p>Music by: HoliznaCC0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:30:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6dba8f456ee6e77918fe85445afec9c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ggargle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
