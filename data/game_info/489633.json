{"id": 489633, "slug": "side-shift", "name": "Side Shift", "name_original": "Side Shift", "description": "<p>This game was created specially for GBJAM 8 and completed only in 4 colours saving the resolution 160x144 (Scaled to be bigger than that). This is a hard platformer where the player will increase the speed of his character everytime the direction will be changed. The hard part is the player cannot stop the character so every turn should be picked wisely. Be careful and do not rush in order to complete it, the game is made of 17 levels.</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>An old dwarf with no beard\u00a0armored with a shield or maybe a wand or a magic sword. He\u00a0tries to invade a castle in order to save maybe a princess or a rock-looking dude from 80s. However the cruel owner of this castle placed many traps for this dwarf and only you can lead this hero to the victory.</p>\n<p>Bugs:\r\n</p>\n<p>[I know usually it is suppose to be a bug fix note in here but, yeah... I don't feel like fixing those]</p>\n<p>* Time to time player may stop jumping at all, for those cases you have a restart button</p>\n<p>* Sometimes player may fall under the floor and die, you don't need a button for those cases. In fact this happens due to very high speed of the character, he just pushes through the walls.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0 There is a 0.3 seconds of penalty after taking a jump, it is to prevent the player from jumping out of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:49:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/66564c33c555a0f9b8f22de2e45c7b11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JimmyTheFork"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
