Since for Ludum Dare I prototyped a game I've wanted to make since I was a child, I did the same for this week's project! Qeebo is a semi-magical virtual pet who is very needy. You can pet him to make him happier, but if you don't give him attention for a little while he will grow quite sad. </p><p>That's all there is to it! I learned more about 3D this week, and also it was finals. So that is where my time went!</p><p>Next week I am making another 3D game, attempting to actually do the kart game I was going to do last week.</p><p>Keep up with my #OneGameAWeek projects and Game Jam games!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36a063a28f4339612e7ed10cacfc3bb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Becker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
