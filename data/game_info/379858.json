This is how the night it all began became known. Much of the population has turned into terrifying zombies that in their insatiable hunger have devoured another large part of it. The survivors take refuge in the bars where they were and after deep analysis they concluded that what\u2019s saved them was the fact they are all consumers of a particular type of craft beer. That's what saved their humanity ! So, they decided to keep drinking this beer just to be sure. And for that, they will count on Steven, a brave and clever pizza deliveryman who will risk his neck to delivery the craft beer.<br/></p>\n<p>The game begins with the brewer summoning Steven to save humanity. At each stage, Steven will get a mission: the amount of beer and the place of delivery. He must annihilate the zombies along the way to his destination. For this, Steven will only rely on a beerthrower and some explosive beers to attack the creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Factsheet</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Developer: The Walking Drunk</li><li>Game: Zombeer</li><li>Release Date: October 06 2019</li><li>Plataforms: PC (Steam and Itch.io)</li><li>Website:\u00a0https://thewalkingdrunk.itch.io/zombeer</li><li>Press / Business Contact:\u00a0twdrunk@gmail.com</li><li>Instagram:\u00a0@zombeer_thegame/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>History</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Zombeer is a project of a group of brazilian indie game developers, called The Walking Drunk.
