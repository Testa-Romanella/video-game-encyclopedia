When launching the game without administrator permissions, Steam might want to launch Spacewar instead. In that case, you need to relaunch Supremity as administrator.\r\n</p>\r\nWhy can't I find my friend's game?\r\n<p>\r\n\tSteam integration is still in the early stages, so restarting the game is recommended, if you can't find your friends game, or other people cannot join your game.\r\n</p>\r\nWhy does the menu bar not display my Steam user name?\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou probably don't have the Steam client running in the background. Make sure to start Steam and then restart Supremity with administrator permissions.<br/>\n</p>\r\nThe game crashed, what do I do?\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf the game crashes, please contact me with as many details as possible, as to when the crash occured, and what you were doing at the time</p>\n\n<p>Download Mirror (slower)<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d75d32d182a778741d7254f285d23a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elewyth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
