It isn't very polished, as I had not planned to show it, but since it is enjoyable for kids to see Santa, I wanted to share it with as many kids as possible.  Make different choices as Gumdrop the elf and surprise Santa with a gift. This game was inspired by Molly's magically adventure. I am brand new to making games, and this was a fun learning experience. There a few glitches (like images outside of the screen, because they were not visible in the scratch player), but since they don't effect game play, they are learning experiences for next time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007fd7ecb9e472487b374c77337d9147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["River"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
