You must control your fleet of starships to defend your planet from the malicious enemy ships. When an enemy is destroyed resources are dropped, with these resources you can recruit new members into your fleet. Enemies also have a small chance to drop Scrap, which can be used to purchase new ship types and abilities from within the Hangar (these upgrades will remain on your account until you reset!)\r\n</p>Endless Mode<p>\r\n\tIn the endless game mode the objective is simple, survive for as long as you can. Using your resources wisely can you defend your planet from the waves of malicious enemy ships?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe longer you survive the faster the enemies come. Make sure to spend your scrap in the Hangar by upgrading your ships to survive even longer!\r\n</p>Beacon Mode<p>\r\n\tIn the Beacon game mode, there is an additional challenge. Whilst defending your planet you must try to destroy the enemy beacons / towers. Once these towers have been destroyed you win!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9a10b1056063629377683d982a9cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NChilvers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
