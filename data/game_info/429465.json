Over the course of a few days in mid-April 2020, I made 'COVID-19: Coronavirus Quarantine,' an actual Game Boy game based on the new stay-at-home lifestyle this pandemic has made necessary. This game is a ROM file, so it is playable on actual Game Boy hardware or on an emulator (like mGBA). <br/></p>\n<p>The best part is that I am selling the game for charity, for just one dollar. The charity is currently undecided, but I will take suggestions and my own research into consideration, ultimately donating all proceeds to a worthwhile cause that is doing good work during these unprecedented times.</p>\n<p>The game is silly, but I hope it gets an important message across: Staying home can get boring, but it's also important.</p>\n<p>I made a video walking through the game and explaining more about it, so watch that via my YouTube channel, Game Game.</p>\n<p>Game by Derrick Rossignol<br/>Illustrations by Kjetil Rossignol</p><p><strong>Media coverage</strong><br/><strong>Uproxx:</strong> A Quarantine-Inspired Game Boy Game Might Be Just What You Need To Social Distance (April 15, 2020)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6dff0ed735b6ffc55115b024e3954076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["derrickrossignol"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
