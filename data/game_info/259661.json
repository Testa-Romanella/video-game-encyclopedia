It's more\u00a0a tech\u00a0toy than\u00a0a game!</p>\n<p>Techniques used:</p>\n<ul><li>A Voronoi diagram (with Manhattan distance) is used to determine the road map.</li><li>A simplex noise map determines altitude.</li><li>Once the voronoi is generated, tiles containing roads are enumerated and tagged based on adjacency; appropriate road tiles are placed.</li><li>Each tile within a \"voronoi cell\" is allocated to the appropriate region.</li><li>Regions are given a type of water, park, rocks, residential, industrial or business.</li><li>Water areas have their heights set low, so the bottom water plane shines through.</li><li>Park and Rock areas have a procedural mesh generated from the height field (sloping to 0 at the roads), which is then added to the world. One of several textures is picked. A series of \"props\" (ruins, statues, etc.) are then randomly placed in the area.</li><li>Residential, industrial and business districts are flat (altitude set to 0, and the mesh uses RLE to only render stripes - BIG performance improvement). Random buildings from a set of available options for that region are then placed on the world.</li><li>I then randomly generate people. Names are built from census tables, skin color is determined from a set of available ethnic colorations (as is hair color). Different meshes are then applied to build a distinctive person. Various clothing options are generated, with random tints.</li><li>Unreal's Vehicle system is then used to drive around.</li><li>Physics determine collisions.</li></ul>\n<p>Source code is available here: https://dev.azure.com/herberticus/ApocalypseTaxi<br/><br/><strong>BSD License and exclusion of warranty, to keep the lawyers happy:</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p>1.
