Do you read me?<br/></em><em>Starwing Beta, connection established. Audio transmission is stable.<br/></em><em>Starwing Alpha, alright, then let\u2019s finally get this gig started.<br/></em><em>Starwing Beta, *sigh* please just adhere to radio protocol.</em></p>\n<p>Twin Ship Shooter is an arcade style shoot-em-up with a twist: Take control of two vessels at once in this space-faring adventure.</p>\n<p>Use the ability to separately control your ships to fight your way through waves of enemies. Concentrate your firepower to dispatch large foes, or split up to wreak wide-spread havoc.<br/>But keep in mind that this comes with a huge risk: Having two ships in this operation means you have to be even more careful about what\u2019s to come.<br/>Can you successfully make your way through this dangerous quest and stop the spread of the evil forces?</p>\n<p>This game was created in a span of one week for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1, starring the theme \u201cStronger Together\u201d. All assets, from sprite work and animations to SFX and music are our own creation and we had a lot of fun crafting it all and putting it together in this small project. We hope you enjoy this bite-sized retro ride.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec509d3a64a37bf3b3f9a53c9a03f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GrumpyGoblin", "Groovy Goblin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
