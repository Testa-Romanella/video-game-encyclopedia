Unfortunately, he gets blocked the way back to his house, and is forced to find another way back home. He goes on a journey across different biomes, fighting pythons and eating all eucalyptus he finds along the way.</p>\n<p>Right now the core mechanics of the game are implemented, but it isn't playable. Need\u00a0 to do level design mainly, and add some extra features such as an endgame, animations, fix audio system etc.</p>\n<p>(Basically, I just wanted to upload something to itch.io to see how it works :] )</p>\n<p>Github page:\u00a0https://github.com/fkeyzuwu/Koolionyx-1.1</p>\n<p>Clickup page: https://app.clickup.com/3837097/v/l/4-5821693-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T14:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/3363b44c9bd6cadd8e274fb2829e1a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["fkeyz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
