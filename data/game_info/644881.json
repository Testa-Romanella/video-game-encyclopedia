While the blade is being dragged, its speed will increase. When you destroy something, the blades speed is added to your score. But be careful, destroying things decreases your durability. Also if an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, it will also take a tick of your durability. While the blade is spinning you can press the right mouse button to\u00a0 use a power that makes the blade bigger, and pressing the space shoots a twirling shuriken. These special abilities use energy that regenerates over time.</p>\n\n<p>Post your high score in the comments!</p>\n\n<p>I made this game with Construct 3, Beepbox, SFRX, and assets from Kenney.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/190/19042f0fa6a02fed9654ced8a6fedc8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
