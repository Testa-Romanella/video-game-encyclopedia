It started when I was noticed the trope where a character would slice a few times, yet the effects would only manifest once he'd sheathed his sword. The moment I saw that, I realized \"I could turn this into a gimmick\". Thus, Zanshin was born.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever created, so really rip into it if you leave any feedback. I'm uncertain if I'll properly finish it up. I'd like to at least add support for more resolutions and a proper level-design.<br/></p>\n<p>Character sprite by rvros at: https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a01/a012a718d79bfe79464e63e314e1d828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drazarus"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
