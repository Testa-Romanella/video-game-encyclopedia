The sun is slowly coming up,<br />\nglistening in the sea of buildings below.<br />\nI look up at the stars one last time before they disappear.<br />\nThey don&#39;t provide any guidance. They don&#39;t give a f*ck.<br />\nI have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don&#39;t know how.<br />\nI&#39;ve never been able to figure out why I do what I do.

There&#39;s no going back. Sure, you can rush your way to the end \u2013 if you don&#39;t mind paying the price. Play your cards right, and you might make it out alive.<br />\nHow far will you go?<br />\nSome questions don&#39;t have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect your family?
