In this game you loop over and over spending your time in between mundane life and sleep paralysis mode. In sleep paralysis mode you will solve many different minigames where you will experience an alternate reality where you tackle your deep rooted fears and problems. As you progress through solving your dream problems, you will start to notice things in your real life environment changing.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you progress the line between reality and dreams will fade as you eventually cure yourself of sleep paralysis through the Freudian introspection within your dreams.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Epilepsy Warning!!! AnxieTea-pot will flash in and out of the frame</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger warning: </strong>Sleep paralysis is a scary and surreal experience that fortunately not everyone gets to experience. The primary objective of this game is to illustrate this surreal feeling while tuning down some of its fright factor. However, proceed with caution and if there is any discomfort please stop immediately since the intent of this game is to be a fun story telling vehicle.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Things to know when playing the demo:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD and mouse to move.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Move to the bed initially to trigger the first sleep.\r\n</p><p>Pay attention to the kitchen!!!!!!</p>\n<p>This demo only features one core gameplay loop.
