He is in a forest, with no shelter, no people, and most importantly, no equipment or wilderness survival skills. His lifeline is a communicator to talk with his guide. But somehow, he&#39;s been connected to you. Try to figure out what really happened and how to get Peter out of this situation.<br />\n<em> A truly exciting story with lots of unexpected plot twists and a nonlinear storyline.<br />\n</em> There are no artificial pauses. The game goes non-stop and it&#39;s up to you to decide when to leave the hero without your attention.<br />\n<em> Find items that will help in your progression. The development of the plot will differ depending on the objects used.<br />\n</em> Sometimes the result depends on chance. The randomness is also affected by the items found and your previous decisions. With a second pass, everything can turn out quite differently.<br />\n<em> In the course of the story you will meet different characters, and only you choose whom to help, with whom to go on a trip, and who is better to keep on distance.<br />\n</em> Some scenarios lead to a successful ending, but do not reveal the whole story. Do you want to explore everything in more detail and understand the very essence of what is happening?
