Audio cues are motivated as a complement to visuals, making experiences more immersive, but are not a primary cue. To address this, we implemented a VR game called Virtual Showdown. We based Virtual Showdown on an accessible real-world game called Showdown, where people use their hearing to locate and hit a ball against an opponent. Further, we developed Verbal and Verbal/Vibration Scaffolds to teach people how to play Virtual Showdown. We assessed the acceptability of Virtual Showdown and compared our scaffolds in an empirical study with 34 youth who are visually impaired. Thirty-three participants wanted to play Virtual Showdown again, and we learned that participants scored higher with the Verbal Scaffold or if they had prior Showdown experience. This is a standalone version of the game used in this study.\u00a0It now\u00a0utilizes a mix of\u00a0voice commands,\u00a0keyboard interactions, and Switch Joy-Con button pressed\u00a0to allow players to play the game without researcher support.</p>\r\nRequirements\r\n<ul><li>Windows OS (An Intel Motherboard is <strong>required.</strong>).</li><li>Bluetooth Enabled Computer (In order to connect headphones and Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to computer.).</li><li>Wireless Headphones or Earbuds.</li><li>Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (To play Showdown.
