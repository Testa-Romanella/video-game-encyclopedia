You score points by walking onto and staying on flower fields. Some pieces can get points by moving or stealing/transferring them from other pieces. Taking another piece will add its points to your piece. Friendly fire is enabled.</li><li>Setup: Each player spawns three pieces before you can start moving them - you can always spawn more though. Spawning only works on certain fields in your back line or around your queen and king pieces. The queen can neither score nor be taken.</li><li>Game modes: I you make no selection in the main menu then four random pieces will be picked. Map creation is always random. Speed mode adds a 30s timer on each player's move.</li></ul><p>Play in your browser: http://schattenkind.net/alice/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7ecfd263c6eb6b954a9e91997112554.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dbltnk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
