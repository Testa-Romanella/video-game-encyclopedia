Customers ask for whatever they please, be that a bread sandwich or a quintuple tomato stack. Your customers are not only particular, they are also quite impatient. If you take too long to fulfill their order, they will take off and give your business a <em>purr </em>review. So make sure to keep them happy!</p>\n<p>If you have any ingredients that you don't want, feed them to the cat on the very left, he's <strong>always </strong>hungry!</p>\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Play with a keyboard or controller!</p>\n<p>Directions can be input using <em>WASD, Arrow Keys, Dpad</em>, or <em>Left Joystick.</em></p>\n<p>- <strong>Move </strong>the chef using <em>Left </em>and<em> Right</em><br/></p>\n<p>- P<strong>lace </strong>down ingredients using <em>Down</em><br/></p>\n<p>- T<strong>ake </strong>back ingredients using <em>Up</em><br/></p>\n<p>- P<strong>ause </strong>with <em>Escape/Start</em><br/></p>\n<p>- T<strong>oggle </strong>fullscreen with<em> F/Select/Back</em></p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Laura King - Art and Game Design      </p>\n<p>Noam Zeise -\u00a0 Code and Game Design      \r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bacfd940d0fc6a04fda8b6572bb03d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["NoamZeise", "Gerbzies"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
