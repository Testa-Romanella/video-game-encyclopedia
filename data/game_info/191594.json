Pangs. Rumblings. Call them what you will. At 27 minutes long, Snack Fans gives as much as one might need to stave off disaster but not too much to cause drowsiness or indigestion.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis game itself is a snack: something light and savoury. We hope that you will be a fan.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHOW TO PLAY\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>You are the DOG and the HUMAN (Cursor Keys and WASD respectively OR touch gestures on mobile)</li><li>Eat Snacks; avoid obstacles</li><li>Get High Score </li></ul>\n<p>OBSTACLES are the things that look less appealing and aren't jiggling about.</p>\n<p>SNACKS are spinning around, growing, shrinking and warping</p>\n<p>SPACE BAR restarts!</p>\n<p>DID YOU KNOW?<br/></p>\n<p>This game can be played single or two player co-op!<br/></p>\n<p> Computergame Concern's HELPLINE with any queries.</p>\n\n<p>2017 update!
