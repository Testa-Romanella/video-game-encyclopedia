A game created by me, Hayden Sokolowski.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I thank you for looking at my game considering how much work I've put into it over the past few months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I understand that the instructions can be a bit unclear, so here's a more detailed description.</p>\n<p>In L E T T E R\u00a0 C A V E, a man finds a mysterious purple cave and decides to explore it. Inside he finds a bunch of random letters to pick up, but he only has a certain amount of time to find them all, so he's got to act fast! At the end of the cave, there is an enemy that is trying to eat you, so you must fight back. Every enemy at the end is allergic to something, so using the the letters you picked up, you can create words that will manifest into the allergin of the enemy, draining its health. Once the enemy's health is 0, you win. If you cannot create enough allergins to win in the set amount of times, you lose. The best part about the letters is that they can be reusable, so you can spell words with two letters that are the same (ex: ball).</p>\n<p>Controls: The game uses either WASD or up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move and jump. During the battle and menu, use the mouse to click on buttons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features: This game has built in instructions, keeps track of the fastest times spend in each level, and a quit button (you can also use escape). As for levels, each one has a set of hidden paths that have letters, as well as bridges that can be jumped through to get to new heights, and a cave somewhere else in the level that leads to the boss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sources: All artwork, code, ideas, and level design were by me.</p>\n<p>The font I used (Retro_computer) was from dafont.com and is labeled as free for personal use</p>\n<p>The sound effects were from freesound.org and all of them have a Creative Common License</p>\n<p>Answers: Understandably, it can be a struggle trying to figure out the right words, so here's a guide to help.</p>\n<p>Level 1: CAT, DOG, ANT, COW\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level 2: MANGO, LEMON, GRAPE, PEACH</p>\n<p>Level 3: TENNIS, BOXING, SOCCER, HOCKEY</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:04:57", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeorgePigStan"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
