This rocket is however more 'wavey' than your average rocket! You must control his wave to avoid obstacles and make it to the end!</p><p>A complete version of this game is in development.</p><p>Build notes:</p><p>As a 3-day project there are some small issues still with this version of the game:</p><p> - you will need to go into options and turn up music the 1st time you play as it defaults to 0 volume.</p><p>- The keyboard input has not been properly set up yet, the game plays much better with a controller. It is playable with keyboard but the acceleration/deceleration does not respond in the correct manner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/096e7ee73626a1837def1e4a0e3b617b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RobFenemore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
