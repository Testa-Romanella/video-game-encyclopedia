Help him and the kids get cozy\u00a0in this short voiced-over Rail Shooter.<br/><strong><br/>A few notes:</strong><br/><strong>THE GAME MIGHT FREEZE FOR SOME SECONDS</strong>\u00a0after the introduction dialogue. It's computing some shader stuff for the terrain. Please wait.<br/><br/>Also please play till the end to stay all night and get cozy.<br/><br/>\u00a0(Sorry for the jankiness of the rotation of the sleigh, it's on a PathFollow and the automatic rotation sucks. I did not have time to implement my own solution)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move the mouse to aim, left click to shoot your Big Fucking Present Gun*.<br/>The kids will throw snowballs at you till you shower them with presents. Getting hit diminishes the cozy meter.
