The theme was \"Running out of power\". I opted for a procedurally generated game since I haven't done one before.</p>\n<p>Mr Shoopashoop activates light switches to reveal platforms, you gain more points the more switchs you activate. Be careful though! The lights don't stay on for very long.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-Left Arrow or A to move left.<br/>-Right Arrow or D to move right.<br/>-Up arrow or W to activate a switch.<br/>-Space to jump. (You can also double jump)<br/>-R to retry once you're dead!<br/>-Alt+F4 to close the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e413a30cf49d5584170c4a0537466ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsoLea"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
