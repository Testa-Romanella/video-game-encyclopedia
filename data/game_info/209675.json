I made it in about 15 hours over two days. The game isn't where I wanted it (that will become apparent if you play it through), but I lost my drive to keep working on it and decided to just start finishing it.\u00a0<br/>All in all it's not great, but it more or less a complete game. It's a text adventure inspired by the things I remember hearing/reading about Adams. I tried to make it somewhat similar to the Hitchhiker's Guide video game, but of course with it's own unique story.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p><p>Keep in mind I'm not a writer... I'm sure there are dozens (or more) typos. It also crossed my mind (after I had started), that a lot of the audience might not speak English natively. The game does a lot of guess work for the \"natural language processing\" bit, and I apologize that playing the game may require a fluent understanding of English, but then again even that might not help.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Interact - <strong>Type Words</strong> and <strong>Press Enter</strong></li></ul>\r\nCredits\u00a0\r\n<ul><li><strong>HitchH1k3r</strong>\u00a0(@HitchH1k3r,\u00a0hitchh1k3rsguide.com)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/6017e08476e70aaa010b40241aaae494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HitchH1k3r"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
