The bastion of interstellar civilisation.<br/>The Empire! Where all life-forms flourish in harmony.<br/>The Empire! Law and order, peace and prosperity.<br/>The Empire! The beautiful, the proud, the calamitous.</p>\n<p>In a distant corner of the Empire, a distress signal comes (as they often do) from a small mining colony -- Monsters have erupted from the depths of the earth (as they often do) and naturally, people are filing noise complaints (as they often do). It's up to team Star Wrecker to save the day (as they often do), largely because there weren't any better options.</p>\n<p>All the while, the drums of war echo in the distance (as they often do) as the Empire prepares to eradicate the Rebels once and for all (as they often do). It's too much to expect for these events to be related, right..?</p>\n<p>Star Wrecker 2 is (another) space-opera bullet hell shoot-em-up in the same vein (to put it mildly) as the Touhou Project. The player must navigate through 6 levels, fighting through increasingly nasty waves of enemies, hundreds of thousands of bullets, and the occasional skippable cutscene. Sometimes hundreds of bullets can be on the screen at once! Don't despair overmuch, though; as long as they don't touch your \"hit box\", a tiny spot in the center of your character, you're safe. (And if they do, you can always press X.)</p>\n<p><strong>This demo contains:</strong><br/>Bullets<br/>Lasers<br/>6 playable characters<br/>3 stages<br/>4 difficulty levels<br/>6 original music tracks<br/>1 unoriginal music track<br/>A harmless travelling preacher<br/>A rookie cop who plays by the rules<br/>Sibling rivalry</p>\n<p><strong>The full game will contain:</strong><br/>More bullets<br/>More lasers<br/>Approximately 6 stages plus an unlockable Extra stage<br/>Significantly more music tracks<br/>A valley girl<br/>A dude in a chair<br/>Possibly unlockable lore entries?</p>\n<p>(cw: Macabre themes, drug references, inconsistent religious parody, mild womb/flesh imagery, vulgar humor, dark humor, Canadian humor, Lucas)<br/><br/></p><p><strong>Changes for 0.5b:</strong><br/>Fixed exploit where beating a boss's first attack with Lucas's or Crash's bomb would generate absurd amounts of hyper (if you beat an attack in less than 5 seconds it will pretend you beat it in 5 seconds)<br/>Dying while at max hyper stock now properly penalises your hyper<br/>Crash's bomb can no longer be mashed out on impact for absurd DPS<br/>Adjusted the power of most of the characters' bombs significantly (Lucas alone is unchanged)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb8d66f0f757269367527d107039e26b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr Frog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
