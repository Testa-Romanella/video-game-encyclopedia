{"id": 973073, "slug": "append", "name": "Append", "name_original": "Append", "description": "Append is a 2D top-down arena shooter with online multiplayer. Play as a futuristic hovering space train in a dilapidated space station, fighting other trains over who gets to scavenge the station or something, whatever. The reason is not important. Your roof-mounted cannon can be upgraded by collecting power-ups, which are stored inside your train cars - watch out so the enemy trains don't destroy them!<br/><br/>Shoot the enemies to shrink them, and to snipe their abilities. Go super offensive and obliterate everything, or put everything on defense. Choose your own strategy!<h3>HUNDREDS OF WEAPONS</h3> Collect power-ups and combine them into hundreds of unique combinations, all useful in different scenarios and situations. There are also many passive abilities that help you defend or attack more efficiently. Each ability can be upgraded to increase its power.<h3>Applicative powers</h3> With applicative powers you can add a debuff to your enemies. These interact in expected ways, fire burns over time, water puts fire out, but also makes electricity spread, snow makes the enemy slower and so on. With each level, the debuff becomes stronger or longer lasting.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Multiplicative powers</h3> If you want to shoot more bullets, you can use a multiplicative power. There are multiple variants of these depending on whether you want precision or mayhem. With increasing levels the rate of fire becomes higher.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Impacting powers</h3> When your bullets hit something, impacting powers make them do something. They can bounce, explode, or even go through walls. With each level, the impact becomes more prominent.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Movement powers</h3> You can also affect the movement of your bullets, like making them faster, chase enemies, or slow down and become a mine. If you combine the mine with other powers, you can even create defense turrets. The movement becomes more pronounced as you get higher levels of the power.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Passive powers</h3> There are also lots of passive powers that improve your chances of winning, like faster movement, healing, luck, and segments that shoot back at incoming projectiles. These powers also amplify when you get higher levels.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Mystery boxes</h3> Sometimes you will come across a mystery box, where you get to choose from 3 power-ups. If you have collected the luck powerup, you will have a higher chance of getting rare power-ups from the box. This allows you to tailor your arsenal to the opposition, and upgrade to insane levels of destruction.<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>ONLINE MULTIPLAYER</h3> Challenge your friends or strangers online, no local server or host required.
