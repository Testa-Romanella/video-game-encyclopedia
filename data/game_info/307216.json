In this game you have to collect all arrows on the level and after that the door to the Viking\u2019s hut will open. You will enter the door and be on the next level. This rule works in every part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut it isn\u2019t easy to do it because on your way to the success you will bump into lots of traps like sharp pikes, dangerous plants and so on. If you suddenly die, you can start the level again and try to finish it. Don\u2019t be scared and good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21fbf50e9c6c0bea57849ec2719c55ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LTrust"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LTrust"], "esrb_rating": null}
