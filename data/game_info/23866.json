There's just one problem\u2026 you've \n      somehow managed to get onto the track driving the wrong way! But hey, a \n      couple of head-on collisions never hurt anybody, right? (Don't quote me \n      on that.) Choose your vehicle, give it a paint job and some upgrades, \n      and see how far you can make it on the Infinitrack!
