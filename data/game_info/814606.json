With small actions, which we could all apply to our daily lives, such as keeping our environment clean or not causing fires due to reckless behavior, the ecosystem will come alive again.\r\n</p>\n<p>Back to life is a project from Dei\u00e0 Escola d\u2019Art i Disseny (Barcelona). The students of the Videogames higher degree were challenged to create a game in which several 2D characters interacted in a 3D scene, responding to the user's orders. The process included the development of an original idea, the design and animation of 2D characters, the modeling and texturing of assets and scene, and the programming of interactivity.\r\n</p>\n<p>The authors of Back to Life are: Juanjo Procopio, Gerard Belmonte and Sandra Guti\u00e9rrez.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T12:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1eeb1b5e4e8a4039a2707335e0eb9b7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EA Deia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
