(Assuming that they did have something in the past.) The fanfic overlaps with many aspects and portrayals of Leo and Piper's relationship by the PJO fandom, from sibling-like and platonic to romantic and sexual. </p>\n<p>VERSION 1.0 - RELEASED 12.7.2017<br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Approximately 12,000 words / seperated into five chapters</li><li>\u00a0Linear interactive text</li><li>a variety of soundtracks from different artists</li></ul>\n<p>Please report any technical difficulties to me<br/>notyourleo@outlook.com or PM me on my tumblr notyourleo.space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc957b57892d6cb2db4cfd62dadac1cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["notyourleo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
