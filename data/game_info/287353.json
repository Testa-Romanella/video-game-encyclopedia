There is a present ghost epidemic, ghosts have <br/>\r\ntaken over several residences and you've been called upon to do the job no <br/>\r\none has been able to do, that is eliminate all ghosts you see occupying the <br/>\r\nresidences.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSince these are ghosts, no normal weapon will have an effect on them. You <br/>\r\ndo have a weapon that zaps ghosts, a ghost zapper which is basically an EMP <br/>\r\ndevice modified by you to zap ghosts. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile it all looks good, the zapper has a kink though. It draws on your <br/>\r\nenergy when fired. This means that you can't go out there with a guns <br/>\r\nblazing mentality in mind. You have to be frugal in your use of the ghost <br/>\r\nzapper. So technically, you can kill yourself if you overuse your zapper.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe good news is, on successfully zapping a ghost, your health is restored <br/>\r\nback to full levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlso you have a map that is your guide to tracking down these dastardly <br/>\r\nghosts, use it well, make sure you keep your distance when hunting these <br/>\r\nghosts, they draw on your health when you get too close to them, even <br/>\r\nbehind walls where you can't see. Mastery of your map is essential to your <br/>\r\nsurvival in this third person shooter.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a ghost, you possess the ability to walk through walls in your bid to <br/>\r\nhunt down ghosts, though this process will draw on your health and is not <br/>\r\nadvised.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have identified three ghost types out there, the reds are the malevolent <br/>\r\ntypes, attacking when you get within range, the yellows which cause <br/>\r\ndifficulty with your lights and the blues which teleport you to other areas <br/>\r\nwhere you may meet the more malevolent types. The different ghost types are <br/>\r\noutlined on your map so be careful out there.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e123eef7d9e6f68c0a7b363592b78ef7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tonye Amienyo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Tonye Amienyo"], "esrb_rating": null}
