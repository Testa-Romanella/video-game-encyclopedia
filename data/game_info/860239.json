The catch? The cubes explode and respawn every 10 seconds. Fortunately, these cubes are special - they record their movement through space and time and will repeat those movements on the next try, allowing you to use them as platforms to jump futher!<br/></p>\n<p>TTL:10 has 10 levels plus one bonus stage.
