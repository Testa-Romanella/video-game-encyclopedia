Fortunately I always get a few notes about the kids and their particular quirks, that kinda helps going through the list quickly. Every second counts, all I want is to get it done and bounce!<strong>\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Try to check the attendance correctly before the time runs out. Every day is a new paycheck, try getting to work as many days as posible!</strong></p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Gameplay:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Identify the students that are currently in the classroom by their descriptions\u00a0and mark them on the clipboard. BE CAREFUL, there are some students that are not actually there and maybe they like wearing the same clothes as the present students.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Once you are sure of your answer (or when the timer runs out), the list will be checked. If you accumulate more than 3 errors in your run, you'll lose.</p>\n<p>- Go as many days as you can!\u00a0Every new day on a streak gets 5 seconds less to check the attendance, so you have to be quick.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for Extra Credits Holiday 2018 Game Jam (itch.io/jam/extra-credits-holiday-2018-game-jam), where the theme was \"Presence\".\u00a0I tried making a simple mix between Papers, Please and Guess Who where you had to try to check correctly the attendance of the students based on their clothes and movement.</p>\n<p>This was made by a 1 man team: Benjam\u00edn Cordero a.k.a lovvyvoy, a chilean game developer.
