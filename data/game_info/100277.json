Poochy stole the dog treats again!</p>\r\nGame Jam Stuff\r\n<p>Hello!\r\n This is my 4th game jam; I started doing them last year with LDJam37. I\r\n wanted to try out doing much lower res pixel art than I\u2019m used to \r\n(16x16 instead of 64x64) this time around, and doing pixel art from \r\ntop-down instead of the NSEW type of style I usually do. It was actually\r\n a lot harder than I thought! I also spent some more time than usual \r\nwith getting the gameplay relatively polished. :)</p>\n<p>My take on the theme was basically a mix between a corgi conga line through the snow and getting piled on by a bunch of dogs because you have food. Thus we have this little game.</p>\n<p>Everything was created during the jam, except for the music/sounds, which was provided by others. (Thank \u2665)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>ANYTHING NOT SOUND:</strong> twitter.com/paigemarincak</li><li><strong>THEME MUSIC:</strong> Kawai Kitsune by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</li><li><strong>SFX:</strong><ul><li>http://freesound.org/people/LloydEvans09/sounds/185828/</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nTechnical Stuff\r\n<ul><li><strong>ENGINE:</strong> GameMaker Studio 2</li><li><strong>ART:</strong> Aesprite</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>MOVE:</strong> Arrow Keys</li><li><strong>OTHER:</strong> Enter</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fd/1fda89600365bf686230c348c30687c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atemly Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
