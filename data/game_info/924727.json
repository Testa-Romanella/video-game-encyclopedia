Locked inside a celestial loop, you need to take control of rollin\u2019 Poe, pick your way across cosmic planes covered with bubbling, colourful patterns, and traverse the different realms therein.<br/><br/>Trapped within a spinning room: watch out for Dummy Ivans, dodge the spinners and then pick a door, any door? Falling through the Cosmic Colon you spill out into one of numerous rooms found at the other end of these tubes. Here you\u2019ll meet curious characters, who\u2019ll guide you on your way and reveal just a little bit more about the Gold Ones.<br/><br/>Fulfil your quota in the Squelch Pit Factory, find-your-way across the gantries and conveyors, watch out for the chitlers, rams\u2019n\u2019hoppers, and don\u2019t fall down the tubs\u2019n\u2019funnels! Harvest the hemispheres, avoid the maggots, play the tannoy and master the ramps to collect all the Elephant Solids.<br/><br/>Switcheroo, you\u2019re falling into another world.
