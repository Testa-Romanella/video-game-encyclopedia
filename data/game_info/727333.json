Snowy decides to start his own restaurant with Browny and enter the contest. With Browny cooking, Snowy must satisfy his customers by seating them, taking their orders, delivering their food, taking their money, and cleaning their tables If that wasn&#39;t enough work, he has to take care of a drive thru and VIP customers along with his normal customers.</p>\n<p>Get extra points through combos (doing the same thing multiple times in a row) and by seating customers in seats that are the same color as the customers.</p>\n<p>Work your way through the campaign to unlock the endless mode. In the campaign mode, you will work through 60 days, with increasing difficulty. As you progress, your restaurant will get upgraded with new tables, nicer floor and doorway, even a cat.</p>\n<p>In endless mode, your goal is to last as long as possible before losing 4 customers. You will be able to choose your own upgrades to the restaurant, though they will be somewhat different than the automatic upgrades in the campaign mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T07:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/220fb8ec65f508d67aa805cde548ee43.jpg", "website": "http://www.aliasworlds.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aliasworlds Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
