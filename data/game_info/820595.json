You are invulnerable to pits, bullets, and enemy dice while you are dashing.</p>\n<p>Standard controllers are supported, too (on an XBOX controller, the buttons are\u00a0A to charge, B to start game).</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Soundole (Peter Anthony Smith) - Design, Programming, Audio Design, Graphics<br/>Connor Grail (https://cgrail.itch.io/) - Music, Playtesting<br/>Bookwyrmle (Erin Harrison) - Stoically looking after our son so that I had a chance to finish making this!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f42936314bfa60fac9af3d49f7fd4ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Soundole"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
