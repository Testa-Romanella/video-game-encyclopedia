Your goal is to destroy every other ship and be the last standing.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys from your keyboard to move the boat, target for the other boats engine, but be carefull at your own engine.</p>\n\n<p>In the week, I had almost no time to code so this game is made in about 4 hours, which mean no music, no souds, no nice graphics, no good IA,... But I hope you'll enjoy it a little bit at least!</p>\n<p>This is my first contribution on itch.io, so if there is any problem, of format or anything, please tell me so I can correct it for next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T05:24:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ec3b0b14058014e159f92d2c0ef4f72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marcoom"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
