They were sanctuaries for creatures great and small. But over time humanity rose to power, and with them came their greed and destruction. The creatures, fearing for their lives, fled the Groves as one by one the Groves were wiped out until only one remained. The Great Spirit, the caretaker of the Groves, knew that if they did not act quickly, the last remaining Grove would also be destroyed. Then along came a fox, the last remaining creature of the Grove. They begged the Great Spirit to let them help, and the Great Spirit acquiesced.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay Features\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Play as a Spirit Fox tasked to restore the Grove's protective wards.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Explore different beautiful locations and complete puzzles\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Gain spiritual\u00a0abilities that allow you take the adventure into your own hands</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>3D Platformer,\u00a0 Adventure,\u00a0 Puzzler.</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>If you would like to help us on our journey, please record your gameplay, if possible, and\u00a0fill out our feedback form so we can make Spirits Calling the best it can be!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback Form</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- WASD to move, Space to Jump</p>\n<p>- Mouse for Camera direction</p>\n<p>- E to Interact</p>\n<p>- Q, Shift, Space for abilities once purchased</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designers</strong></p>\n<p>Project Owner - Bec Russell</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer &amp; Scrum Master - Kyle Beaton</p>\n<p>Lead Narrative &amp;\u00a0Scrum Master\u00a0\u00a0- Bekki Broughton\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Designer - Alex Alimbuyuguen</p>\n<p><strong>3D Assets and Animation</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Animator - Tea Cosmos\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brett\u00a0Higham\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charlie Wall<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>\n<p>Joshua Hall\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mohit Rao\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>\n<p>Maria Borg\u00a0</p>\n<p>Megan Sanelli\u00a0</p><p><strong>Asset packs used</strong><br/></p><p>Cloudscape seasons - <em>Nielson Lima</em></p><p>Dreamscape Meadows Stylised Open World Environment - <em>Polyart Studio</em></p><p>Stylized Forest - <em>TomkaGS</em></p><p>Controller Icon Pack - <em>NullSave</em><br/></p><p>Controller Icon Pack -\u00a0<em> Piontek</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce626f80f3c41cd5c1892f0e6f5c4126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lilya", "AlexAlimbuyuguen", "cacctus1", "silverwolf115432"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
