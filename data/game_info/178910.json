The gameplay is pretty basic, left click to select and right click to attack another security, but the challenge is in figuring out the right order to do things to maximize profit.</p>\n<p>This was created for Wizard Jam 6, and is the first game I've made from scratch myself on UE4. My background is in gameplay programming on Unreal Engine 4, but for this I made models, animations and materials from scratch as a challenge for myself. I did use a bit of UE4 starter content. Took about 24 hours of development spread over a week</p>\n<p>If you have trouble running this you may need the Visual Studio 2015 redistributable</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a099eb668175238fcc07975d682b7106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoubleBuffered Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
