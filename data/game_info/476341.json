There is also a rewind to a former time, with the possibility of rewinding history. So there you go.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Code, Music - Tim Sheinman (Owl_Skip)</p>\n<p>Art - Daniel Duke, Tim Sheinman</p>\n<p>Voice Work - Gem Andrews, David Bramwell, Daniel Duke, Tim Sheinman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9ab4d0a55452ba7c39c1617eddd43c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
