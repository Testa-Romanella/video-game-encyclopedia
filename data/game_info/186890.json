When customers call an order pick up a matching cup by standing in front of it and hitting \"A\".  Now you have to fill that cup up.  Stand in front of a beer tap and hit \"A\" to fill it.  You can hold up to 3 drinks.  Use the right and left bumpers to select your inventory.  Then walk up to a customer and hit \"A\" to give them a drink and they will tip you.  \"Select\" exits the game.</p><p>Sometimes it doesn't register where you are standing so you may have to step away and walk back up.  Still working on that issue.</p><p>This was a game for Ludum Dare that I convinced my wife to work with me on.  She did all the art even though she's not an artist and has never made a game before.  The are is all cut from construction paper.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2793f7a47d4b3c8c075125b8dc9f61a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gameDevSteve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
