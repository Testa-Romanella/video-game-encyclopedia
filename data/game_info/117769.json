You can mute it and pick your own to play along to! Pick your Beats Per Minute (60 to 240), and the length of your song (0:59 to 10:00), for if you feel like taking it slow or giving yourself Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.</p><p>The game defaults to 120 Beats Per Minute and four minutes and forty-eight seconds to match the royalty free music used as default. <em><strong>This is the way the game is meant to be played and is balanced as such!</strong></em> Changing either the length or BPM will automatically mute the music (for obvious reasons) and affect the difficulty in hopefully clear ways.</p><p>Use Z and X to do everything!</p><p>The GIFs don't do it justice, the experience comes from playing it yourself!<br/></p><p>Like it?
