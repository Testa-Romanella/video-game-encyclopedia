There is a lot of depth and the game behaves exactly how you would expect with all systems in place. The only part of the game that is unfinished is the map selection. Every gun and power up from the original game has been implemented.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17e/17ef770d49ec3236b57076e59df9d97a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yoyolick"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
