It is a simple game, with simple mechanics. The game is entirely multiplayer, and you can host a match for other players to join. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers spawn randomly across the island with an assault rifle. If a player is killed, the player respawns at another random location on the island. That is the entire game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you would like to view the source code of this project, and help develop it (or our other games) further... you can file an application on our website to become a community developer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/8211700897f3a9ebbf324b175eaebce1.jpg", "website": "https://www.bluedrake42.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drakeling Labs"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Drakeling Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
