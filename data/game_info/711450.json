Escape their clutches!</strong><br/><br/>This is a rogue-lite-lite-lite for Secret\u00a0Santa Jam 2021. I tried my best to work in the preferences of the giftee as well as the titular cats!<br/></p>\r\nGood stuff:\r\n<ul><li>It's a thing you can play. That is better than I usually do with jams so I'm happy.</li><li>The giftee owns the titular cats, and I thought for a bit on how a player could control two avatars. I ended up with the spinning cats!</li><li>I enjoyed animating the RoboCulkins a lot. I used to do really small animations when I was a kid, but working as a software engineer doesn't lend itself to many chances to play around with animation.</li><li>I like the art style. Wait, hear me out! I think mixing stuff together collage-style is really fun. Plus, as a child of the flash age, when games were crude and oftentimes ugly, it just felt right.</li><li>This was my first time recording my own sound effects for a game!</li><li>Writing the room generation algorithm took a while. I was on day 2 of working all day and my brain was fried. Once I got the random walk working though I was psyched!</li></ul>\r\nBad stuff:\r\n<ul><li>There's no boss. I wanted a boss, but I ran out of time.</li><li>The DVD-logo-esque movement of the RoboCulkins came from several hours of trying to spin my own pathfinding. I had wanted to do something that used colliders to inform the enemy where to go. Obviously, I gave up!</li><li>Lack of variety in general. I wanted deeper rogue-y stuff: more enemy types, more obstacle types, pickups.</li><li>The music is pretty awful. I didn't even plug my MIDI controller in because I was so down to the wire. I just put some beep and boops together in 5 minutes and called it good enough.</li><li>Default unity UI stuff......</li></ul>\r\nNot my stuff, licensed via Creative\u00a0Commons:\r\n<ul><li>padlock</li><li>macauley culkin, progenitor of the RoboCulkins</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e94/e9452053e9faa1f9a2975f62acb0082f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Evan Sampson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
