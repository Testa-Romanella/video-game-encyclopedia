This is not going to be as easy as it seems: there's a lot of work, and some undesirables may make your work tougher than expected !<br/><br/>The game takes place over <strong>52 levels</strong> and is spread over four seasons.<br/>Your goal is simple: to manage the farm and deliver the orders within the time allowed.<br/><br/>Mimi will have to grow and harvest crops, care for the livestock, and use machines.<br/><br/><strong>Mama Farm is not a farm simulator</strong>, it's rather an action game in which reflexes and organization are the keys to success (like <em>Diner Dash</em>)<br/><br/>The game also features a complete tutorial, a storyline, a trophy room and<br/>a mini game: \"Hit the moles !\"<br/><br/>The game has an expected duration of <strong>at least 7 hours</strong> !<br/>. Deliver orders in time.<br/>. Monitor your crops, livestock and machinery.<br/>. Chase undesirables away !<br/>. Win trophies!<br/>. A thoroughly crazy game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d218528bd3fba9946d3a9f4acdea63f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleAngel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
