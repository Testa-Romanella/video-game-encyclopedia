The Vollcross Empire, a brutal fascist regime, has launched a surprise invasion of the Kazanov Union, intent on eradicating the perceived communist threat.<br/><br/>In the early days of the war, the Empire's forces were unstoppable, crushing opposition with ruthless efficiency. But as the Union mobilized its vast population and fought back, the Empire's supply lines began to falter, and the once certain victory began to slip away.<br/><br/>The fate of the war now rests on Khaligrad, a key city that holds the precious oil fields both sides desperately need. The Union forces have dug in and are putting up fierce resistance, turning the battle into a brutal and prolonged conflict. <br/><br/>Welcome to a place where war is the only truth, where victory is the only option. <br/><br/>Welcome to the front, officer.<br/><br/><strong>Choose your side</strong><br/>Khaligrad offers you 2 challenging campaigns.<br/>Will you fight for the Empire, a formidable invader with limited supplies and distant support?

But resources are scarce and winter is getting steadily harsher.<br/>Difficult choices lie ahead.<br/><br/><strong> Tell your own story</strong><br/>Depending on your successes and failures during the campaign, your story evolves and takes different directions.<br/>The missions entrusted to you by your HQ evolve accordingly.<br/>Will you become a so-called hero who always manages to repel the enemy despite numbers?
