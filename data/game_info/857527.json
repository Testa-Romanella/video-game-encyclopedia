They will not hear from their gods until spring when the leaves return and there are more nutrients and impulses spread through the roots. They celebrate the falling leaves as their nutrients are absorbed by the fungi and used for many purposes. They believe that building shrines shows their respect to the trees before their sight above ground is lost for the cold seasons and they spiritually retreat underground.</p>\n<p>The ceremony is non-competitive and is participated in by a random selection of fungi-folk from different backgrounds / families who are coming of age. It is rumored that a perfectly built shrine will lead to a certain resonance of natural energy which will prevent the trees from coming to any harm.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b560396e4590036d30df51229ed0a495.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabriel Bissonnette"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
