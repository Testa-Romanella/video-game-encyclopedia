As your opponent is trying to do the same, strategical thinking is required to outpace more skillful contenders.<br/><br/>There is no time pressure, yet sessions flow quite quickly, with a single match typically taking about a minute or even less. As you defeat the easier competitors, more serious opponents are unlocked. Overall, the game offers 4 different AIs to play against. While you will easily domineer over naive and short-sighted Greedy, the Merciless, on the other hand, stands true to its name.<h3>Good Luck, Enjoy This Little Game, and Thank You!</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e93c142834be6dd9ac091d7c2af1e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gleb Cherkayev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Handy Dandy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
