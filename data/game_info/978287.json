{"id": 978287, "slug": "a-twisted-tale-2", "name": "A Twisted Tale", "name_original": "A Twisted Tale", "description": "Discover a humouristic point and click adventure inspired by all the masterpieces which made us stick to our computers back in the day (and therefore we played outside way too infrequently). Full of loony characters, unexpected twists and challenging riddles.<br/>Accompany Vio on her unintentional journey through various realms. Explore broken cities, pirate ships in the deepest jungle and other unreal places. Stand by her side when she makes the acquaintance of the (depressive) Death and engage with lots of explicit and ambiguous references, hommages and imitations of the big classics past (and not quite past) times.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Meet quirky characters with Vio and discover a world that doesn't seem to have much in common with our own. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The heart beats for retro! That's why the solo developer draws all the background graphics the old-fashioned way with paper, pencil and ink. They are then coloured digitally. All animations are hand-drawn in the classic frame-by-frame style.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A Twisted Tale extends over a total of 7 chapters. Each chapter takes Vio into a new world with its own setting, small stories and a large portion of classic point &amp; click adventure riddles. <strong>The first chapter, which can be discovered with the release of the game, has an average playing time of 6 - 8 hours. All further chapters will take at least this amount of time and will be released as DLC. </strong><h3>Key features</h3><br/><ul><li>Hand-drawn traditionally and digitally created graphics in 4K/Ultra HD<br/></li><li>Classic frame by frame animation<br/></li><li>1-click interface<br/></li><li>Female main character<br/></li><li>An undead deuteragonist (depressive Death)<br/></li><li>Lots of explicit and ambiguous references, hommages and imitations of the big classics<br/></li><li>Even more comical, thrilling and unique characters<br/></li><li>Weird humor and retro-vibes<br/></li><li>Varying worlds and twisted settings<br/></li><li>Extensive story and classical complex riddles<br/></li><li>Decisions affecting the game<br/></li><li>Alternative endings</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T13:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34f78dec5822a90f0df78dae05feb2ee.jpg", "website": "https://twistedtale.de/en.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Voodoo Bembel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Voodoo Bembel"], "esrb_rating": null}
