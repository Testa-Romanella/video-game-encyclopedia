While this may seem like an easy task in any normal platformer,\u00a0you may find that your\u00a0instincts betray you, as every jump in midair\u00a0reverses in direction.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a traditional entry into the \"Foddian\" genre,\u00a0where the learning curve seems steep, but you will soon see yourself mastering jumps you once thought impossible, taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back.\u00a0Keep at it until you reach the top!</p>\n<p><strong>Developer time:</strong> 15:00<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated time to beat:</strong>\u00a0Eh, you could probably do it in a couple of hours</p>\n<p>Created by Max Rauffer<br/>https://twitter.com/MaxRauffer<br/>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>3 controls schemes are supported:</p>\n<p>Type 1: Xbox controller<br/>Left analog stick - Walk<br/>A/B - Jump<br/>X/Y - Attack<br/></p>\n<p>Type 2: Keyboard\u00a0Arrow Keys<br/>Left/Right Arrow Keys - Walk<br/>Z - Jump<br/>X - Attack</p>\n<p>Type 3: \u00a0Keyboard WASD\u00a0+ Mouse<br/>A/D - Walk<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Left mouse - Attack<br/></p>\n\r\nConfused by the controls?\u00a0This description of the mechanics may be helpful\r\n<p>Change direction by moving left/right. The last direction you moved is the direction you are facing. When standing on the ground, the arrow hand of the clock shows you which direction is forward.</p>\n<p>Your first jump will send you forward.\u00a0If you jump once more in mid-air, your jump will send you backward. Attacking buttons will launch you in a\u00a0direction AND will refresh your jumps. In midair, your next jump will always be the reverse of your last jump! When in doubt, look at your clock's hand, it will point in the direction of your next jump!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can switch which direction you are facing in midair, this will change the direction of your jump. Using this mechanic, you can jump in the same direction twice! The series of inputs required looks like this:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Jump in the desired direction<br/>2. Press move in the opposite direction you are jumping<br/>3. Jump again while still in the air</p>\r\nAdvanced Concepts:\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Coyote time.\u00a0</strong>When walking off a platform, you can still use your two jumps for a short amount of time, instead of only having 1 midair jump available. This may be useful for getting some distance from platforms you want to jump back onto with your reversed jumps.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Velocity canceling.\u00a0</strong>When you jump, your velocity is <em>set.\u00a0</em>This means that if you jump while falling, no matter how fast, you will jump with the same velocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Sliding.</strong>\u00a0A unique quirk in how the movement in this game works is sliding. If you have horizontal velocity when hitting the ground, you <em>slide,</em>\u00a0slowing to a stop. If you press a movement direction while sliding, you will stop sliding instantly and move in the desired direction.<br/>There is an exception to this rule, which is slippery surfaces, which only occur later in the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc2bbb81c4f279cc25ce5c884bf2543f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Max Rauffer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
