(you can click on the button or press space)</p>\n<p>I focused on the dev mostly, no music or no sound and graphics are very poor. I think I will use it as a prototype for a real rogue like where the action (attack, spell,..) will be random as it is here but the moving parts won't be random.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4ccf6251939005ad24d2777925959e55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jean-Marc Studio | JMS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
