The purpose of the project is to show a little bit about the problems disabled people have when going to vote. A good portion of places in Illinois do not have easy access for disabled people. I showed this through out the game and some examples of this are having an uber pick you up, finding an elevator can be like going through a maze, not all doors have an automatic button to open them. The game is supposed to feel a little tiresome going back and forth as to also add to the experience.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to see more content that I have worked on check out my portfolio:</p>\n<p>https://brandonf-portfolio.weebly.com/</p>\n\n<p>Made by Brandon Figueroa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:01:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe9d502839143440924a49e09bb31a02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bfigueroa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
