It was the first relic to come into existence and a very powerful one at that. The power of the relic is of one that corrupts, destroys and breaks down the hardest of elements, thoughts and minds. Only that of a strong mind, body and soul can handle the power it welds.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The relic was kept safe in Moss Mountainside before Clyde Dez Kope stole it for its power. After coming into contact with the relic, it distorted and destroyed Clyde\u2019s mind and body beyond recognition and enhanced his corrupted thought process. Now that he\u2019s in possession of the relic, he now has the power to turn innocent shapes into distorted shapes that he now calls the \u201cKorruptid Army\u201d. By doing this, he created a vast army of these \u201cKorruptid\u201d to take over the shapes of Shape City. It is now up to Capsence and Remsule to stop Clyde Dez Kope and his Shapes of Evil.\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71f972f18e452055bf971f587a085281.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FT Gamers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
