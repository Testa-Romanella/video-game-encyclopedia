It is both my first stab at prototyping in PuzzleScript and creating a puzzle game. I attempt to create an engaging experience by introducing new concepts individually and gradually building on the complexity of them across 9 short levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/9765587f09985320cab5bcc7bc92b3c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Stox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
