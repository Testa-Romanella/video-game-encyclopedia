For generations and generations, the citizens of Pompeii have established an underground civilization called New Pompeii, living a comfy yet mundane life as they remain forgotten by the rest of the world. In the aftermath of the devastation of Mount Vesuvius\u2019 fire, you play as a curious boy who draws himself into the center of uncovering mysteries surrounding his sanctuary and the ominous lands beyond the safety of his home.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay surrounding To Land And Back consists of simple controls as if a child were to be exposed to a game for the first time. Yet, these simple controls will be used repeatedly over time as the player progresses through different puzzles with different mechanics. The puzzles are paired with a deep visual narrative and a homage to Ghibli\u2019s art style that aids the player\u2019s immersion into the story of \u2018To Land And Back. \r\n</p>Get To Know Us\r\n<p>The game is made by Playtendo Studio, which was formed in September 2021 for the module \"Game Project Studio 1\". The formation of our members was decided by our lecturers. Our goal is to create narrative experiences for our players to enjoy and remember, leading us to create games that will portray our stories to the audience. As our theme was alternate history, the name \"Playtendo\" was chosen for the team with the idea of an\u00a0alternate history where Playstation and Nintendo combined.</p>\n<p>Playtendo Studio consists of\u00a01 Game Designer, 2 Artists &amp;\u00a0 4 Game Programmers:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Emran Islah Halid</strong><ul><li>Lead Designer</li><li>emranislah@gamil.com\u00a0</li></ul></li><li><strong>Benedict Chew Kai Jun</strong><ul><li>Lead Artist</li><li>benedict416@gmail.com</li></ul></li><li><strong>Esther Lim Shxingyi</strong><ul><li>Artist</li><li>shxingyii@gmail.com</li></ul></li><li><strong>Noor Adriana Putri Binti Noor Zainy</strong><ul><li>Lead Programmer</li><li>doemfl99@gmail.com</li></ul></li><li><strong>Yue Min Jun</strong><ul><li>Programmer</li><li>prosciutto976@gmail.com\u00a0</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chan Kwok Chun</strong><ul><li>Programmer</li><li>guluerechan@gmail.com\u00a0</li></ul></li><li><strong>Akmal Bin Zulkifli</strong><ul><li>Programmer</li><li>akmalzulkifli08@gmail.com\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>How To Download\r\n<p><strong>Install Instructions for itch.io:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<ol><li>Press on \u201cDownload Now\u201d</li><li>Unzip the downloaded file.</li><li>Export the \u201c <strong>To Land and Back (JM21) 3.30v</strong>\u201d file to your preferable save file.</li><li>\u00a0Open  \u201c<strong>To Land and Back (JM21) 3.03v</strong>\u201d file.\u00a0</li><li>Open \" \u201c<strong>To Land and Back Beta Build.exe</strong>\" to start the game.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Install Instructions for Google Drive:</strong></p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L2DtKhB8ePTeW9jx4PpyU_mAjHZesLNG/view?usp=sharing\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Press on the google link\r\n</li><li>Click on the \u201c<strong>To Land and Back (JM21) 3.30v</strong>\u201d file\n</li><li>Download it by pressing the download icon on the top right)\r\n</li><li>Unzip the downloaded file.\r\n</li><li>Export the \u201c<strong>To Land and Back (JM21) 3.30v</strong>\u201d file to your preferable save file.</li><li>Open  \u201c<strong>To Land and Back (JM21) 3.03v</strong>\u201d file.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Open \" \u201c<strong>To Land and Back Beta Build.exe</strong>\" to start the game.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a259daccf347b9697c9c9810ed413444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UOWM Game Development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
