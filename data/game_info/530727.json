I am truly sorry the current version is exactly just that \ud83d\ude2d</p>\n<p>I got distracted while trying to do as much via code. I wanted have to use the editor little as possible. Writing tools I probably would not have need, and trying out new workflows\u00a0kept me from making an actual game \ud83d\ude05</p>\n<p>A least I learned something\u00a0\ud83d\udcaa<br/></p>\n<p>The drawing mechanic\u00a0I borrowed from another Game Jam game\u00a0MYRKUR, I was part of a few weeks ago. Check it out. The maze gets procecdurally generated and increases with every level.<br/></p>\n<p>All in all I am totally not satisfied with the outcome.
