The two colours I chose were black and white - to fit the retro, arcade-like style.\u00a0The themes were \"You are the Weapon\" and \"Space\".<br/></p>\n<p>The main goal of the game is to protect the <strong>core </strong>and survive as long as possible.You can dash (using the Left Mouse Button) to kill enemies, which spawn\u00a0every few seconds. Every time you kill an enemy you lose some hp, however the enemies\u00a0also drop Coins. You can pick up the coins (using Space Bar)\u00a0and use them\u00a0to buy health potions and other items using (Tab\u00a0or Esc)*. \u00a0There are 4 <strong>turrets </strong>surrounding the core, which\u00a0point towards the nearest enemy.\u00a0Enemies spawn faster the longer you've been alive!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :)<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>*When you buy an item, the corresponding key to use it is displayed at the bottom of the shop.</p>\n\n\n<p>Programming and planning was done by Sweego\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the sprites were done by: Splek</p>\n<p>Music and SFX were done by:\u00a0Sushi chef</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eeb/eebed0691ed8eeb2c564894c34fa9969.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sweego", "Sooshi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
