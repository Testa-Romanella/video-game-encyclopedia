They know to get back to their home, they need to cast a demanding spell. But for it to work, they first have to\u00a0find the shards of a real soul and put them back together.\u00a0<br/>Through mazes, fighting sceletons and\u00a0 finally the last piece of the soul will be theirs... But will their life energy last?<br/></p>\n<p>The mysterious vendor keeps taking more of it.\u00a0<br/><br/>We had an issue, where building the game did work weirdly with scriptable objects, so we changed one variable in this build that allows for players to at least play all levels. We're planning to release a post-jam version once we finally figure out, what exactly went wrong.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49b74d1f416ce10a1d605adb10c7257f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RAC-Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
