Work together with chef robot to make the best possible meals for customers.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Wowie Game Jam 4.0. The jam duration was a little over three days, but due to other obligations we spent about 48 hours on it. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>Cook a dish that tastes how the customer wants, then hit the bell to serve them their meal!</p>\n<p>Clicking ingredients adds them to your pan and changes the taste (sweet, spicy, or savory) of the dish you're cooking. The customer's taste is indicated by the green, yellow, and red regions of the \"taste triangle,\" where green is exactly what the customer wants.</p>\n<p>The chef robot will try to help by tossing ingredients into your pan! Hopefully this is helpful, but if not, try to counteract the tastes by adding your own ingredients.<br/></p>\n<p>The game ends when you serve enough customers bad food or let them wait too long on their orders. How high can you score?</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Art</strong>: fungusbones (Twitter)</p>\n<p><strong>Code</strong>: plasmastarfish</p>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong>: shoulder-cat (Twitter)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Fonts</strong>: A Goblin Appears!, All the Way to the Sun, Corbel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a6c22078cd94215809bc900fb5b7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["plasmastarfish", "FungusBones", "shoulder cat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
