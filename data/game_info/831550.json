This game is inspired by the original\u00a0Star Fox for the Super Nintendo\u00a0and the Super Scope 6 (Nintendo's bazooka peripheral). Star Ranger is\u00a0our first 3D game, and we learned a lot in the process of making it! Coopal00ps spent a ton of time recreating the look of the old Super FX Chip, while Pandamander worked on the gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>\n\r\nGAME CONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Shoot - Right Mouse Click</li></ul>\n\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>This game is a collaboration between Coopal00ps\u00a0and\u00a0Pandamander, made in 31 days for our game-a-month challenge.
