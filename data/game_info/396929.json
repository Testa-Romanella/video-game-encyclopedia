You explore a castle full of monsters in a 2d castlevania-like setting with random encounters ala Final Fantasy turn-base side-view battles.</p>\n<p>DEMO: It will render something around 1h gameplay and will end when you get a 'bronze key' and open one of the two doors that leads to the next castle areas. There's a save point on the second stairs to the right. I suggest going there first to avoid the bug:<br/>KNOWN BUG:\u00a0 If you get a random encounter in the big staircase areas, you'll be respawned out of place and get stuck there, forcing a game quit.<br/></p>\n<p>The purpose of posting this demo here are:</p>\n<ul><li>Act as a \"Portefolio\" to show previous projects I worked on</li><li>For the sake of prosperity and to put behind me this project that took me 4 years of programming and was forcefully cancelled</li><li>Check if there is some interest on seeing me reborn this project with RPG maker and lead it to a completed game.</li></ul>\n<p>Cordially, TSR<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:02:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11bc7f0dc28db5163a0e473ba09e2ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["TSR"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
