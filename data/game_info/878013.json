The world has switched from oil and gas to a new resource pumped up from deep under the earth's surface. Albeit this highly radioactive gas is far more powerful then other fossil fuel sources it has a nasty side effect. Toxic and deadly to humans without  hazmat suit it also caused mysterious and grotesque mutations in previously harmless species. These critters grew to enormous proportions and developed a cruse form of intelligence bent on destroying all of the human efforts to turn the radioactive gasses into usable fuel.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere comes the solution: risking the lives of too many heroic young technicians already the humans started to train and arm the pipeline crews to defend &amp; repair the instalations. With the help of a potent arsenal of destructive weapons and prevision engineering resulting in deadline gun towers, the brave technician-soldiers can do their job with at least a healthy 2% chance of survival... (up from 0,000002% before).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood old fashioned 2D arcade fun with tons of upgrades and fast paced action where taking risks is rewarded with a higher score.
