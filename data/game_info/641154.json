Pythagoras was one of those men, he kept the artifact with him and made magnificent discoveries, bringing contributions to all mankind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He built a time to guard and protect the artifact from people with bad intentions.

A sign indicates the location of the artifact, but this will not be such a simple task as the ancient mathematician placed many challenges and pitfalls everywhere, only those who are good at heart and understand the power of the artifact will be able to overcome its challenges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Understand geometric shapes, they say something about how to solve these challenges.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To solve the game's challenges you'll have to switch between two characters that have different abilities:</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trax </strong>: Infantry Soldier, his costume is designed to have good mobility on the field, being able to perform jumps to great heights, and his arms are equipped with claws that allow loading objects.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zac</strong> : Engineering Assistant, wears a suit with four mechanical legs capable of climbing walls, its small size is also advantageous for traveling in narrow areas</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROL: <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>TAB to switch aliens<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARROWS/WASD to move <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT to charge (tall alien) <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>E to pick up blocks (tall alien)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SPACE to jump <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SPACE + SHIFT to dash jump (small alien)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R to restart current level</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/624f1305cc0faa89912bef922c3c22d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Danielgameart", "@mal@", "Brizly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
