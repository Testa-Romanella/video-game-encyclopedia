The assets were a lot of fun to make. The \"learning coding while making a game simultaneously through several disparate tutorials\" was a completely different thing altogether!\r\nAll in all, we had a lot of fun and it was a good learning experience. Who knows? We might polish up the game to be more than it is right now for a future release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:33:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32f/32f764e700e2cc5667db6c00fa80005b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FacemeltingSolos"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
