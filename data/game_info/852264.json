This is meant to be as unintrusive as possible, so it's up to the player if they wish to explore every dark corner and learn every secret of this bizarre world or just simply blast some monsters into bits and breeze through it.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\nInitially this project was started to compete in a gamejam, but I've been enjoying creating this world so much I decided to turn it into a full game. Once completed it will be distributed in a classic shareware model. Out of three \"episodes\" (each consisting of six levels) the first one will be available for free, so any player can enjoy a good portion of the game before deciding if they want to purchase the full version.\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n\r\n\u00a0Episode 1: Vile Infestation\r\n\u00a0Episode 2: Blood on Ice\r\n\u00a0Episode 3: Draconian Void\r\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>JOIN OUR DISCORD SERVER\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>game by Epicentre_Workshop</p>\n<p>music by Sirental</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T19:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/089/089e8138e1381e993a5d37b6081dac13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["epicentre"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
