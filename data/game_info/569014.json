It mashes up game mechanics of your favourite games to create something new. You can play on your iPhone or Apple Watch.<br/><br/>The remixed games are:<br/><br/>\u25a0 SUPER JUMP<br/>We\u2019ve taken the fun of the humble platformer game and mashed it with an endless runner. Keep your player running by jumping over holes, ditches and enemies. Collect fruit to score points and the more you score the faster you run. <br/><br/>\u25a0 RETRO RACER<br/>Inspired by pseudo 3d racing games like Outrun and Pole Position but with modern graphics. Enjoy the surreal, exhilarating sense of speed while you race to beat the clock.<br/><br/>Please note this game requires a watch series 4 or newer.<br/><br/>\u25a0 CONTRA PANG<br/>A mashup of Contra\u2019s shooting action and the bubble popping fun of Pang.<br/><br/>\u25a0 CIRCLE INVADERS<br/>A new twist to the classic Space Invaders. With a unique circular design and lots of power-ups.<br/><br/>\u25a0 MOON SNAKE<br/>We took the classic fruit eating snake and put him on the moon. Avoid the bombs and your own tail to survive. <br/><br/>\u25a0 DUAL BREAK<br/>What could be better than the classic paddle game Breakout? How about power-ups and an extra paddle to control.<br/><br/>\u25a0 CIRCLE BREAK<br/>It\u2019s like Pong in a Circle meets Breakout. Keep the ball from leaving the circle and break all the obstacles to finish the stage.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022 Apple Watch support<br/>\u2022 Screen shake<br/>\u2022 Vibrations<br/>\u2022 Sound Effects <br/>\u2022 Music<br/>\u2022 Leaderboards", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T03:59:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea344e96a25548099c43179b1d4a3ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["AlhoGames"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Rui Alho"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
