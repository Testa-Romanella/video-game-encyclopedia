{"id": 686201, "slug": "spawn-kill", "name": "Spawn Kill", "name_original": "Spawn Kill", "description": "<p>Spawn Kill is a fast paced 2D\u00a0shooter with a few small mechanics. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible and get as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>Storyline :\u00a0Toxic Slimes from the \"Third Dimension\" have invaded your house\u00a0(reasons will be revealed in further installments ... if they ever arive).\u00a0They can shoot and prove to be quite hazardous.\u00a0Having too many of them in the vicinity is dangerous.\u00a0Only you can save your house now.\u00a0All you have is your trusty pistol with shotgun bullets supplied from the \"Third Dimension\".</p>\n<p>Gameplay\u00a0: Apart from the standard shooting, there are several things to look out for. There is a \"Panic Mode\" mechanism.\u00a0If at any time there are atleast 8 enemies in the field, they gain a raged state. The enemy firing speed and bullet speed is increased at that time. This game is primarily focused on gaining higher scores. You get a \"Class\"\u00a0according to your high score. Class C\u00a0(0 -\u00a02999), Class B (3000 -\u00a07999), Class A (8000 - 14999), Class S (15000 - 29999) and Class SSS (30000+).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dev Notes: These are some bugs that I don't know why they exist. Probably future me will be able to solve these issues.<br/></p>\n<p>1. Player doesn't move when launched. Restarting seems to fix.</p>\n<p>2. Sometimes player keeps going on one of the cardinal directions even when a key is not pressed. It goes away after a while on its own though.</p>\n<p>This is a game that I\u00a0made to try my hands at different unity features and create something of my own. I was tired of watching random game making tutorials in youtube so I\u00a0decided to jump right in. I'm happy the way it turned out to be honest. In the future I may come back to this little piece and remaster it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e1dea850964894ac58e74155e68822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["arman_ferdous"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
