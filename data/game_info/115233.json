In-air dodging, fast \r\npaced puzzles and intense shooting will keep on the edge of one's seat.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nWho said spikes and lava should bring immediate death? \r\n\t<strong>Yury</strong> is a fresh \r\nlook on classics! Yury's space-suit lets you quickly jump through the \r\nhot flow and gives you some time to crawl to the checkpoint after being \r\nhit by sharp edges.
