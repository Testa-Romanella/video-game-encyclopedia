I need your support to stay focus on this development as a full-time job. In addition, I'll be able to hire some wonderful artists to rise the game to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not using crowfounding plateforms?</strong><br/>I want to give you some fun NOW, not in one year ! And I have designed the game to always be playable as the project moves forward and your feedback could be a very precious component to create a fantastic game together!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Version 0.1</strong> - CURRENT VERSION</p>\n<p>One first playable map with features listed below :</p>\n<ul><li>Player controls and first skills</li><li>Camera controls (360\u00b0 rotation around the player and top-down to third person view)</li><li>Zombies generation &amp; behaviors (AI)</li><li>Random resources</li><li>Building exploration and first interactions</li><li>User Interface and Inventory system</li><li>First game mechanics</li><li>Basic Sound FX &amp; Music</li><li>Only one Map</li><li>Environment design and lighting system (including Day&amp;Night cycle)</li><li>English version only</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>More details in the roadmap section</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Explore and interact with buildings</strong> to find ressources, weapons and a refuge</li><li>Repair &amp; <strong>Drive vehicles</strong> (cars, vans\u2026)</li><li><strong>Advanced behaviors for zombies</strong> (field of view, react to sounds, physic interactions\u2026)</li><li><strong>Skill system</strong> : Your experience influence the gameplay</li><li><strong>Quest system</strong> : Meet other survivors (NPC) who seek help in exchange for resources</li><li>Multiple maps with multiple biomes in 3D stylized environments</li><li><strong>Day &amp; Night</strong> Cycle</li><li>More than <strong>10 different weapons and unlikely traps </strong>:-)</li><li>Helicopter piloting with dedicated weapons</li><li><strong>Wild and dangerous animals</strong> (eating zombies but survivors too !)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Note :</strong> In the final release, your road trip will be made of different maps in a random order, with random resources and procedurally generated zombies so each game is different !</p>\n\n<p><em>May evolve during the development - one version every 4-6 weeks</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Version 0.2</strong> - Planned for February 2019</p>\n<ul><li>Repair and drive vehicles (cars and vans first) : Vehicles controls - Vehicle damage / Vehicle repair - Gasoline management - Sound FX - Interaction with Zombies (make them flying away !)</li><li>Localization System</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.3</strong></p>\n<ul><li>More weapons and traps</li><li>NPC, Quests, Bartering</li><li>Player : XP and Level system</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.4</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Save &amp; Load system</li><li>Game options (Controls, Graphic settings\u2026)</li><li>Building improvements : Random interior spawning of zombies</li><li>Add barricades on broken doors or Windows</li><li>Player Gender select (Male or Female)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.5</strong></p>\n<ul><li>New Maps and Biomes</li><li>New quests from NPC</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.6</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Wild animals</li><li>More variants of zombies</li><li>Zombies behaviors enhanced : Polishing scripts</li><li>Add react to light?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version 0.7</strong></p>\n<p>Helicopter : Controls, Damage, Repair, New physics and interactions / Dedicated weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Version 0.8</strong></p>\n<p>Weather effects : Rain&amp;Storm (Player can get sick) / More maps<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Version 0.9</strong></p>\n<p>War mode : Infinite ammo &amp; explosives, player invincibility and zombie hordes / Dynamic music system</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>\n<p>New weapon : Sword/saber and sliced head effect / Add Beer ressource and Self-Control Skill / Global Polishing, Debugging and Optimization.</p>\n<p><em>In The Middle Of Zombies</em> is a full 3D game with graphic option settings so it can run even with low graphic cards but your experience would be better with a recent system.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum system requiremnts</strong><br/></p>\n<p>OS: Windows 7 64 bit / MacOS 10.11+ / Ubuntu 12.04+ (requires 64 bit OS)<br/>Processor: Dual Core Processor, 2.5 GHz or higher - SSE2 support<br/>Memory: 4 GB RAM<br/>Graphics: DX10 compatible video card (Shader 4.0)<br/>DirectX: Version 10</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> (displayed in the game tutorial)</p>\n<p>Move: WASD or Arrow keys<br/>Shoot a zombie : left mouse click on it (him?)<br/>Rotate camera : Right mouse click and left/right drag<br/>Camera height : Mouse wheel<br/>Jump : Shift key<br/>Player info/inventory panel : TAB key (or click on the player portrait)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/8931ddd080d7917fc8f83f8eb66dcfa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wabby's Land"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
