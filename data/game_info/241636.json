After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>The sea wind carries the sound of Banshees wailing or is it the keening of murdered innocents whose deaths need to be avenged? The Fishermen's Fairweather Stone is cursed and the villagers are starving because their luck has turned bad.<br/><br/>Can you lift the curse and save them? It's time to be heroic once more. Talk to the fisherman Dran Faircatch to find out what you must do. The task is not simple. You'll need all your courage and keen wits to face the perils that lie before you.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select \"Cursed Stone\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 16 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Cursed Stone has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/398e4a6437c2eb247127d47793b3ae4c.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
