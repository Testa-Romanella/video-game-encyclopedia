The only difference is that with frames this \"somewhere else\" can be anywhere, <strong>discontinuities in space included</strong>. <br/><br/><br/>If anywhere should be somewhere else frames can be <strong>move</strong>d. <br/><br/><br/>If something is in the right place, but with the wrong size frames can <strong>change the size</strong> of objects. <br/><br/><br/>And if something falls in an inconvenient direction frames can <strong>change gravity</strong> of objects. <br/><br/><br/>And frames can do even more:<br/><ul><li>The ubiquitous cubes and activation buttons. <br/></li><li>A \"Paint Gun\" allows to dynamically open and close frames. <br/></li><li>A \"Light Gun\" that changes how objects interact with frames. <br/></li><li>Frames can have any size and appear in high numbers. <br/></li><li>All features of frames are implemented in the most general way possible and cooperate with each other. No scripted events, no restrictive special cases. </li></ul><br/>All this results in a staggering number of puzzle-possibilities and the carefully crafted levels make sure to use them to the fullest in this logic-based physics-puzzler.<br/><br/>Other features are:<br/><ul><li>A story almost as complex as the game mechanics. <br/></li><li>All mechanics are explained \"intuitively\" through level-design without the need of explicit tutorials or text. <br/></li><li>85 levels. Every single level exploits a different aspect of the mechanics. No filler, no repitition. <br/></li><li>A hint mechanic, so you never get stuck. <br/></li><li>Full support for mouse/keyboard and controller with freely configurable inputs.</li></ul><br/><strong>Thinking with portals is easy. Now, try thinking with frames. </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T05:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7fd355745ffe0ad2ab4b8161b25504.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MechanicsDriven"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MechanicsDriven"], "esrb_rating": null}
