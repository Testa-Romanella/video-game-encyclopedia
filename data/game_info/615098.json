Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.\n<br/><br/>\nBecome a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIn this 20-40 hour game, you'll:\n<br/><br/>\nCombine cards to tell your own story in a rich, Lovecraftian world of ambition, appetite and abomination. Corrupt your friends. Consume your enemies. There is never only one history.\n<br/><br/>\nFound a cult, dedicated to the Red Grail, or the Witch-and-Sister, or the Forge of Days. Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat's-paws. Use your disciples to keep you fed - or feed on your disciples.\n<br/><br/>\nUnravel arcane, unacknowledged mysteries. Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Locate and pillage the Star Shattered Fane. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus.\n<br/><br/>\nOutwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities. Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped.\n<br/><br/>\nTranscend death with a story-driven legacy system. Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they'll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they'll bring the Dawn.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter:\u00a0@factoryweather,\u00a0@alexiskennedy,\u00a0@tronbevan</li>\n<li>Facebook:\u00a0here!</li>\n<li>Instagram:\u00a0here!</li>\n<li>Reddit:\u00a0here!</li>\n<li>Discord:\u00a0channel here,\u00a0invite link here</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dancer DLC is a story-focused add-on to Cultist Simulator, the award-winning Lovecraftian card game. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the occult cabaret that calls itself the Ecdysis Club, the distinction between pleasure and pain is as delicate and essential as the human skin. It is all that keeps us from making the very worst mistakes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPursue a career as a Dancer at the Club. Determine which parts of yourself to surrender. Cross oceans in pursuit of the ancient rites that beat in the Wood. Consider the ascensions that open to you. Choose carefully.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DANCER DLC includes:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRise to unearthly fame as the Dancer, employed at the infamous Gaiety Theatre, Ecdysis Club or in some of the more exclusive city parlours.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExplore a trinity of insights into the powers of Heart, Moth, and those who came before. Realise your true form, and perhaps even tempt one of the enigmatic Ligeians to the Dance...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome dances can only be performed in far places, and some cannot be performed in human shape.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo play as a Dancer:\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBegin the game with the Dancer legacy. This will always be available if you win a minor work victory at Glover and Glover, and sometimes be available otherwise anyway.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo pursue the new Ascensions without being a Dancer:\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFind Sulochana, and speak with her at the Ecdysis Club about your current Desire.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nThe GHOUL DLC is a story-focused add-on to Cultist Simulator, the award-winning Lovecraftian card game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA disgraced medium. A gallery without windows. An elixir which permits the most final of feasts. A gnawing hunger which cannot be denied. All reflected in the snow-coloured eyes of Miss Naenia, gentlest of the Elegiast's Names.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDig in cemeteries. Desecrate tombs. Consume the dead to unearth their secrets or commemorate them. Comfort or betray the living. Eternize the lost Hours in the Palest of Paintings. Just be careful to feed your hunger before it grows beyond you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GHOUL DLC includes:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a shadowy living as a disgraced medium. Hold imaginary conversations with paintings. Serve the purposes of the Elegiast, though they may cross the purposes of the other Hours. Seek a beautiful end.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecome a Winter Long, immortal and matchless beneath claw of the Ivory Dove. Or lose yourself to a power that grows Nowhere.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFind and rob graveyards. Consume the lesser and the greater dead to learn their secrets. Share those secrets with the living, or paint them into your canvases. Consume the corpses of your followers, and gain a little something extra from their more interesting scars.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ghoul legacy may be available randomly when you begin a new game, but it is always available if you ended the last game by succumbing to Dread.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nThe PRIEST DLC is a story-focused add-on to Cultist Simulator, the award-winning Lovecraftian card game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA quiet rural parish is in need of a new priest. The arrival of one who might show them the Way has long been prophesied, and though the themes of their sermons may seem a little unorthodox, their true faith cannot be denied. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow the path of Knock and serve your Disciples, both master and mastered. What is mortification of the flesh, set against those glorious visions of St Agnes? What the pain of this fleeting world against immortality as Martyr of the Keys?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PRIEST DLC includes:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStep up to the pulpit and open the minds and hearts of your congregation. They, in turn, will open you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecome a Way that only your initiates may pass, or dwell in one who comes from Nowhere.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInspire new recruits with the fervour of your faith, and rededicate your cult at will to serve your necessary purposes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccumb to Fascination in another playthrough to unlock the Priest Legacy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T04:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/033e003d328db93440327bdfa030d5c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Weather Factory"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Weather Factory"], "esrb_rating": null}
