And all of this led me to a dead end every time, because I'm a beginner. Yeah, that makes sense. So I decided to discard all the complications and release an ordinary runner for the time being. I'll be glad to hear your comments! Thanks!<br/></p>\n<p>* At this point in the game there is no settings window.</p>\n<p>** Thanks\u00a0ansimuz\u00a0for free assets!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T19:05:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f5540058a924625cb4662d071df45929.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Horizon Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
