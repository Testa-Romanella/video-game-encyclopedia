Please keep this in mind if you get stuck.</strong><br/></p>\r\nBlocks\r\nPusher\r\n<p>The Pusher will push the dice in front of it along\u00a0without it rolling over. Be careful to not push a block forward into another one though.</p>\r\nPuller\r\n<p>The Puller will pull a block from 2 spots away without it rolling over. Ensure there is nothing between the puller and the block you want to pull in order for it to work.</p>\r\nRotator\r\n<p>The Rotator grabs the block in front of it and turns 90 degrees. It will continue to rotate without holding onto a block, so make sure to get its initial orientation right.</p>\r\nRoller\r\n<p>The Roller is used to start the dice rolling in a set direction. The rolling can be stopped when the dice is interacted with by another block or it rolls into a wall. Use this to change the orientation of the dice so the correct face is upwards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805ff8b2feb3f78bf68861ddc8fa09ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Reedsman", "Lucas RiedlShah"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
