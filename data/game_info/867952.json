I ranked all subjects' difficulty and represented them as a number of the bomb. If you clicked the bomb, so you got F right away. This game was developed for about one week. I mostly spent the time on creating the API to get the total score and save them to the database. Btw, I hope you enjoy my Game and thanks for playing.
