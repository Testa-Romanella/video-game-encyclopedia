I had no intentions on releasing this game, but was convinced to do so. It didn't take much to convince me but-\u00a0Oh!\u00a0I'm rambling. Okay!\u00a0This is my first time building a FPS(successfully). I'm not good at them in general, so this is going to be a little off, if you're use to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>#ExcuseFactory<br/></p>\n<p>So! I\u00a0got sick before the jam started. I\u00a0was going to bail completely, but instead I\u00a0made this marvel. Yes, my voice cracks a lot in the VO... it is because I'm sick \ud83d\ude14I\u00a0wish I\u00a0could've given you the full MrTroy diva performance you all love.\u00a0 The game is very short. You can play and finish it within 5 minutes, so that's a plus!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>There are no way to modify controls. I'm sorry non QWERTY people.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I\u00a0also didn't put in gamepad controls. I'm sorry gamepad people.</em></p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure nobody is going to read all this so. Hi, nobody! I made this game for you! There are one or two hidden gems in this game, that I\u00a0keep laughing at. You probably won't think it's as funny as I\u00a0do. If you do find it funny. Let me know\u00a0on \ud83d\udc18</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/eccc4898e707155e8009d4011bd52b9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["MrTroy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
