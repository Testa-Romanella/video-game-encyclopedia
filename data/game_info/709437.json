Compete against the clock and against other players. Use your spells and gain points and levels for completing your increasing square pattern.\r\n</p>\n<p>GoTet has a multiplayer mode, but will never use bots! So don't worry if you're the only player, GoTet is equally fun in single player style. Spread the word and maybe next time there will be more players.</p>\n<p>Game modes:</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Single Player Classic</p>\n<p>You play in a solo lobby. The game ends when you complete the maximum level. The lesser you take to beat the game the higher your score is. You only have \"Spin\" as a spell and it costs 1 point. </p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Single Player Modern<br/></p>\n<p>Same as Single Player Classic but you have more spells to help you. Some of the spells have a fixed price while other depend on how many tiles you currently have.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Multiplayer<br/></p>\n<p>You compete with other players on the same map. You move slower once your level increases but you also gain more points. Once you reach the maximum level you cannot grow anymore but the game continues. You have all the spells so be prepared for different strategies. The longer you resist in the game the higher your score is.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Movement and actions:</p>\n<p>1) You start with an empty square pattern. You have a name, a level completion percentage and a time to live. The completion percentage represents how much of the square has been filled. The time to live represents how many seconds you have left to complete the level, before the game is over. <br/></p>\n<p>2) You move your square around<br/></p>\n<p>3) You glue tiles to your square. When you complete your square pattern you gain one level:</p>\n<p>- your square pattern size is increased</p>\n<p>- the tiles glued by you are destroyed and re-spawned somewhere else on the map</p>\n<p>- you gain more points (you also gain points per second)</p>\n<p>- you get slower (on higher levels)</p>\n<p>- points are used to cast spells. Some of the spells have a fixed price. Other spells have a dynamic price, depending on how many tiles you have currently glued and are enabled only you have at least one tile glued. Check the spells bar on the left to see the spells prices. </p>\n<p>- the time counter is reset to a new value</p>\n<p>There are special tiles that value more points: [Bronze], [Silver], [Gold]. If the square contains only special tiles when you complete the level, then you get a significant points bonus. </p>\n<p>4) At any point you can drop all your tiles<br/></p>\n<p>5) Other players are shown in yellow. You can grab tiles from them and they can grab tiles from you too, unless special spells are activated.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Move (WASD, arrow keys or mouse left click)</p>\n<p>Grab tiles (space bar or double click)</p>\n<p>Drop all your tiles (key M or right click)</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Spells:<br/><br/>\"Spin\" (Key N): Rotate around center. Possible only if the position after the spin is valid (no collision of your tiles with other tiles).</p>\n<p>\"Magnet\" (Key B): It will attract all your tiles to the center of the square and rearrange in a spiral.</p>\n<p>\"Shield\" (Key V): It will activate an ice shield which will protect you from other players.</p>\n<p>\"Fire\" (Key F): It will activate a fire spell that will destroy any near tiles your square will run into, including tiles from enemy squares.</p>\n<p>\"Shrink\" (Key C): It will decrease the level of all players that intersect your square and have a completion percentage smaller than you.</p>\n<p>\"Speed\" (Key X): It will temporarily increase your speed, unless you're already at maximum speed.</p>\n<p>\"Time\" (Key T): It will add more seconds to your time to live.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Mobile Controls</p>\n<p>On mobile, tap, hold or move in the desired direction. Use the left wheel spells to glue or release tiles. Use the right wheel for other spells.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>For more help please check the tutorial page from the main menu.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>This game was created because I wanted to learn web programming. I've started searching for a language in which I could write a web server for a game and I finally went for Go. For the client I had already javascript in my mind. <br/>To be honest, I thought web programming was easier, but the journey, at least until now, has proved to be an arduous one but I've learned a lot of new things on the way.<br/></p>\n<p>I have great plans with this game, from making interesting spells (invisibility, teleport, exploding tiles, permanent/temporary blocking tiles, moving tiles, tiles puzzles, and more end-game stuff to do) to adding art, better graphics and sounds to it. Currently all of this is impossible for me. There are hosting costs (the game is hosted on an minimal ec2 aws instance, with a S3 bucket) and a lot of work for one man.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is still in early development. Please report bugs to gotetgame@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p>I really hope the game will grow and you'll enjoy it. If you like the game, please consider to support.
