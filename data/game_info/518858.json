One time, a friend of mine poked a hole on the side and decreed that we could only <em>look inside</em> and not shake the box to guess. Needless to say, that one stuck with me. The same concept is explored here. A game that\u00a0\"lies to its player\" feels really broad. To me, a forced perspective is almost a white lie to the player, because the constrained viewport \"lies\" to the player by omitting everything else in the game world since the player is forced to only look in one area. I think this prototype is interesting, though its gameplay feels rather straight forward. I'm interested in exploring this concept further.</p>\r\nNumber Keys / KeypadSwitch which face of the mystery box to look intoWASDPeek around the viewport to gain a little extra perspectivePlus &amp; Minus KeysIncrease and decrease your critter countReturnFinish countingRRestart the game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:24:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/bee84cdc4ee710535965779922f03324.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
