Short rope or long? Do you satisfy the crowd's thirst for cruelty or grant a merciful death to the man you're not even sure is guilty?<br/></p><p>We at Lesser Evil Games are creating The Executioner to put such choices in front of the player. Starting with Ludum Dare 37 where we launched a bare-bones version of the game we've been hard at work turning it into what it was meant to be:</p><p>An RPG thriller that puts you in the shoes of a man who tortures people for a living and has to fight to preserve his own waning sanity.</p><p>It's a game about the price we pay both for cruelty and for mercy, about how much you're willing to sacrifice to get to the truth \u2014 or to satisfy a bloodthirsty crowd and your exalted employer. It is a quest of self-discovery. Like Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram the game asks:</p><ul><li>Do you know who you are?</li><li>How far are you willing to go?</li><li>Do you want to live this way?</li></ul><p>With your help we want turn our prototype into a rich experience with fleshed-out characters, gripping gameplay, art and soundtrack and a story that might help answer those questions. With a dash of pain and despair on top.</p><p><strong>Best working in fullscreen mode</strong></p><p>Support us on Kickstarter! </p><p>Website</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Twitter</p><p>Instagram</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2c4608b1150e5a2ec5bea662bb5451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["executionergame"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
