There are only two choices.</p>\n<p>There isn't an end state and I haven't really figured out the best balance, but I think there could be potential in this game later on with story elements added to actually have some depth beyond just balancing the stats as it is now. Still, hope you enjoy the excellent visuals by @michaelfirman and the music by Ruinaerr!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba0a9ddbd7c34acebdc85cc44d239db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lopar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
