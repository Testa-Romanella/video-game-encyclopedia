In this playable demo, you can play the first level as the tomato character. Each character has a primary weapon, secondary weapon, melee attack, dodge roll and special ability. The game is part of my college course, and is essentially still a work in progress. </p><p>NOTE: You may need to zoom out within the browser in order to see the whole game.</p><p>If you die, simply left-click on the 'expired' screen and you'll re-spawn at the last save-point.</p><p>Here are the basic controls:</p><p>LMB - Shoot</p><p>RMB - Melee</p><p>W,A,S,D - Move</p><p>SPACE - Dodge Roll</p><p>R - Reload</p><p>Q - Swap Weapos</p><p>E - Activate Special Ability</p><p>P - Toggle Pause</p><p>SHIFT - Advance Dialogue</p><p>Music:</p><p>https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html</p><p>\"Noise Attack\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ </p><p>https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html</p><p>\"Dreams Become Real\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>Sound Effects:</p><p>http://freesound.org/people/Paul368/sounds/255716/</p><p>Silenced Pistol Layered (Powerful) by Paul368</p><p>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons 0 License.</p><p>http://freesound.org/people/LeMudCrab/sounds/163457/</p><p>AK47 Shot by LeMudCrab</p><p>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons 0 License.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fa127be07a5472a5eff9c97459be694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PJ-Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
