One of his arms is a vacuum and the other looks kind of like a swiss army knife! Robbie is handy when it comes to fixing computers. He's also small enough to get right in there where humans can't reach. Computers look quite different to tiny Robbie. In fact, Robbie the robot encounters all sorts of different obstacles\u00a0such as fried wires, loose wires, broken capacitors, or maybe even gremlins! (They're real!)</p>\n<p>Come along with Robbie the Robot and make the tiny electronics world a cleaner, safer, and a more productive place.\r\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Lots of blood, sweat, and tears went into this game, but somehow we forgot to implement the blood sweat and tears into the game mechanics... Maybe next time we'll get it right ;)\r\n</p>\r\nimportant Instructions:\r\n<p>The controls are hard to use, we're going to update it soon. For now, just know that <strong>`A` and `D` keys can help you navigate through the main menu</strong>. Pause to see controls (`~` key or 'P' or Pause key, ESC doesn't work in browser). <strong>You have to long-click</strong> to change tools. <strong>Capacitors are often dirty and require vacuuming</strong> before installing. When installing capacitors<strong> be sure to Solder them in place</strong>. Batteries do not require solder. We made 3 Levels, the last one I was up all night trying to get working, but I had to disable the last puzzle in order to get the game submitted in time\u00a0:(\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Oh, and last but certainly not least, you can place wire to connect power to things! Look for light-blue things around the maps. Some of them you'll need to push around in order to solve the puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T16:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e973cf5ecb93c3aefec616f510ab57a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["RobinsonDillon94", "s-p-n", "Notwindows", "vanderhook"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
