Programmers Chris Rhinehart and Jason Blochowiak got together with artist Rowan Atalla back in 1996 to lose some sleep and hop to it, creating a fun and challenging game in just 24 hours. They blew it. It took them 33 hours and a whole lot of caffeine, but what they came up with was Dueling Mini-Vans. Then they went back and added a few enhancements so that we could now proudly present this fine game of mindless mayhem to you, the unsuspecting gaming audience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-04T18:42:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/602ff33639068b1ace47c29586327499.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Human Head Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
