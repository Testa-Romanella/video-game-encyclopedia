Face your rivaling school in a fierce and hilarious ball game, where the main objective is to move a big ball to the opponents\u2019 goal line by using every trick in the book. This is done by throwing whatever item you can find on it. If you should happen to miss the big ball, you may accidentally realize that these items work just as well on other players! Sending your opponents flying with an explosive keg or slapping them across the face with a rubber turkey is just a couple of the many strategies you may employ during a match.<br/> <br/>Be wary though as humans aren\u2019t the only threat out there; Watch out for fire hydrants and manholes ready to burst at any moment, or the school mascot goat that found its way onto the pitch and is attacking anything in its path!
