There wasn\u2019t a new king lined up to lead them, since king William III never had any children. The chaos quickly spread through Whoolyland and different leaders arose to lead their own clans of Whoolies. All these leaders started leading their own realms, to fight the remaining Whoolies of Whoolyland that didn\u2019t want to join them. It is up to you to save the Whoolies of Whoolyland and to bring back the peace they used to live in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fight all the kings of the other realms and bring back Whoolyland to its original state.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76fd1ae330c358a7492b91ba74544b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhoolyganGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
