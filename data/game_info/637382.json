The game is still playable with just keyboard.</p>\n<p>Known bug:<br/>- When space bar is press too frequently, the echolocation effect breaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>melon</strong>\u00a0is a mass of adipose tissue found in the forehead of dolphins. It focuses and modulates the animal's vocalizations and acts as a sound lens. It is thus a key organ involved in communication and echolocation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*We do not own any of the character in Full Metal Jacket and are not monetising our game.*</strong></p>\n<p>Voice Actor: <br/>- Aaron McDougall (The General, The Crew Member, Stg.Oceana)<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds:\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/</p>\n<p>Sprite:\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/2d-arts-for-submarine-sidescroller<br/>-\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/underwater-diving-pack<br/>-\u00a0https://eccothedolphin.online</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/8806f43fab7199baacc92c8a07bcc7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RathSKM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
