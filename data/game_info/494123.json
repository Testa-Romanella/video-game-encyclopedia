We all have great ideas every day, but they quickly snowball into something bigger than anyone wants to deal with once we try to explain them to others.</p>\n<p>Designed for 4 players, a standard hand is 1 card more than the number of players. Cards are loosely based on a standard poker deck, with only numerical values between 1 and 13. The game has two phases: the first phase decides the value of the pot and which player becomes the house, while the second decides whether the house gets to keep  their victory.<br/></p>\r\nPhase 1: The Pot\r\n<ul><li>The game begins by each player choosing, in round robin, two cards to add a card to the pot.</li><li>If playing with physical cards, the player to the dealer's left starts. In this web version, the host player always starts.</li><li>This goes around twice, allowing each player to add up to 2 cards to the pot.</li><li>Once both rotations of round robin are done, the player that contributes the highest total value to the pot becomes the house.</li></ul>\r\nPhase 2: Scoring\r\n<ul><li>Now that the house is ready to claim the pot, it is the table's chance to crumble their hopes of an easy victory!</li><li>The house draws an additional 2 cards.</li><li>The table goes round robin, one player against the house at a time.</li><li>The table player plays a card to decide the suit, and the house must match or beat its value in order to claim that player's slice of the pot.</li><li>The house must either play within the suit set by the table or play triple or more the table's value.</li><li>If the house wins a slice, the sum of the pot plus the extra card played by the table is added to the their score.</li><li>If the house loses a slice, it counts as -1 to their score.</li></ul>\r\nTie Breaking\r\n<ul><li>If a tie happens in phase 1, both tied players will become House for the second phase.</li><li>Both House players must individually match or beat the table's card. The player that plays the highest card gets to claim the more valuable card from that slice of the pot.</li><li>If one House player does not beat the table's card, then the other gets to claim both cards from the pot.</li><li>If a ties happens again in phase 2 between the House players, then the player that played their card first takes the higher value card from the pot.</li></ul>\r\nGeneral Rules\r\n<ul><li>A player can choose to play outside of the current suit at any time, but the card will only be worth half the value. For example, a House must play an 8 of Office or higher to beat a table player's 4 of Social.</li><li>The above rule of half value only applies to comparing cards against each other. If a Table player plays a card that is outside the pot's suit and the House claims that card in phase 2, the House still adds the full value of the card to their score.</li></ul>\r\nWinning\r\n<ul><li>The\u00a0first\u00a0player to\u00a0accumulate 50 points wins the game.</li><li>Points are accumulated over multiple rounds </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/4539c156fc5de915684f1982de9a6ad4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gifthammer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
