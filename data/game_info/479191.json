In response, King EEEE sends his finest soldiers to stop their nefarious plans. What's that, he doesn't have an army? Looks like we need some volunteers...\u00a0Turn down no fennec who wishes to take up arms!</p>\n<p>Fennecs is a short rpg where you fight with parties of small fennec-humanoids with randomly chosen classes. Unlike a typical rpg where the classes are wizard, monk ect the fennecs have jobs like \"Aerobics Instructor\" and \"Pharmacist\" each with one unique ability. BE CAREFUL, because if a fennec falls in battle they run away and are replaced by a new fennec.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7bcefaa3060027cc10dd53c4195cf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Momwolf"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
