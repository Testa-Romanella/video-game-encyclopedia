Peranakan culture originates from Southern Chinese people who migrated to the Malayan and Indonesian peninsula a few centuries ago. You'll notice lots of Peranakan-inspired art assets (colourful and detailed) in the game and Chinese-inspired music.</p><p><strong>\u00a0We are having trouble with our MacOSX build so that it is temporarily unavailable</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The main enemies are jiangshi, hopping vampires from Chinese mythology.</li><li>The money in the game is joss paper, which is paper money you burn to send to your ancestors in the world of the dead.</li><li>In the second level, you'll notice rice bowls with chopsticks sticking up in the feast for the dead -- sticking your chopsticks upright indicate that the food is an offering for the dead, which is why you're not meant to do that when you eat normally!</li><li>The music in the second level is inspired by Chinese festival music, which is full of gongs and drums to scare away ghosts.</li><li>The boss in the fourth level is Heibai Wuchang, guardians of the underworld that escort the recently deceased.</li><li>At the end of the game, the ghost calls himself as a \"hungry ghost\". This refers to the Hungry Ghost Festival in the 7th month of the lunar calendar, where the gates of the underworld open, so people must leave offerings and burn incense for the ghosts.</li><li>There are four levels because four is the number of death in Chinese.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04b95d0085da37f2ce9d09b628568eb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ivanbje"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
