Check this (abandoned?) platform for parts, if you want to get yourself flying again!</p>\n<p>A Musical Exploration Game. Every object you pick up changes the music.</p>\n<p>Made, thanks to Game Dev Unlocked's 7 Day Challenge.</p>\n<p>They got me thinking in terms of simplified exploration experiences, with just enough objective to make exploration worthwhile... and no more! Just get the game out, get it shipped; game #2 can have more features.</p>\n<p>The 7 Day Challenge encourages using the asset store to fill up your game's locations. The instructor, David, even specifically suggested that 7 days is not enough time to make something like a sci-fi base. It's not like I took it as a challenge, it's just that space is where my stories live.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kenney Asset Forge (available on itch) I was able to make the set pieces in this game within a few days, and keep their style (moderately) consistent.</p>\n<p>Adventure Creator for Unity let me add the functionality. That took a few days, as I\u00a0am still new to the plugin.</p>\n<p>And the music, I composed on the dawn of the final day, in Tracktion Waveform 11.</p>\n<p>It was heckin difficult mentally to stay on track, but the hard part is over: I've made and released a 3D game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42f/42f81280e79eb8881b01d7308271e96c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah Wizard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
