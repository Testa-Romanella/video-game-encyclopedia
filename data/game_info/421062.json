{"id": 421062, "slug": "flotsam-feast", "name": "Flotsam Feast", "name_original": "Flotsam Feast", "description": "<p>Ahoy! Happy quarantine to you all! Flotsam Feast is the first game I've ever built with GameMaker Studio, and the first game/thing I've ever built, ever! Neither of us have ever done anything in game development and it was definitely a fake-it-till-you-make-it situation.\u00a0<br/><br/>It was built for Island Jam 50 with a restriction of \"only 1 level\" and a theme of \"islands\". It was built from March 20-22, 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Katy Aleshire</strong>\u00a0(IG: @katyaleshire) did all the art and <strong>Jack Goslin</strong> (psyoptic [at] gmail)\u00a0did all the development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game is built for 1920x1080 and I'm not sure how it'll be if it's resized. Sorry!</p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>The whale wants some food but there's only trash on the beach! The whale will ask for a recipe and you will need to pick up the items needed to create it. Click the wave button next to the instructions to wash up new trash on the beach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Once you have the 2-3 items needed to make the recipe, click on them in the inventory at the upper left and see what shows up in the recipe box. A red circle means that what you've selected is not a valid recipe. If anything else shows up and it looks like what the whale wants, give it to him by standing next to him on the blanket and pressing E. If it was the correct recipe for what he's currently asking for, he'll be happy and the \"recipes completed\" counter under the inventory will increment by 1.</p>\n<p>All 5 recipes will be made up of 2 or 3 items each, and they aren't removed after using them.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>E to submit the current recipe to the whale when next to him or on the blanket</p>\n<p>Left-click in inventory to select an item for the recipe. Only 3 items can be selected at a time!</p>\n<p>Right-click in inventory to remove/delete item</p>\n\n<p>The possible trash items are:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>bag, wood, nails/tacks, rope, golf balls, box, red paint, brown paint, cigarette butts, bottle</p>\n<p>Keep pressing the wave/tide button until you see the items you need!</p>\n\n<p>BEWARE OF BUGS! I haven't done a lot of rigorous testing but I did run into one case where I couldn't add or remove anything from my inventory. Haven't been able to recreate it either...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/83604a5caaf1b70aebee47d1fe894ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["physys"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
