The player assumes the role of Hawkins, a space fighter pilot charged with protecting the Hyturian star system from invading alien forces. The game uses wireframe and shaded vector graphics to depict combat, in a similar fashion to games such as Elite and Starstrike 2, which was also created by Realtime Games. Ariolosoft had previously published the Electronic Arts titles Skyfox and Arcticfox and the name was chosen to build on the success of those titles. The US Commodore 64 release was titled The Rubicon Alliance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d6253c383ee81be2e677ff5fd46c66e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Realtime Games Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ariolasoft", "Reaktor"], "esrb_rating": null}
