So what do you do?<br/><br/>Naturally, of course, you\u2019d run from the cops for as long as you can. What you don\u2019t expect is to be stuck on a circular race track trying to avoid a collision! Imagine how the robber feels, he\u2019ll never get away no matter how hard he tries. <br/><br/>In this classic arcade style game, you are Spence Parkerson: world's greatest thief.

You've managed to evade them so far but a wrong turn sends you into an abandoned raceway.  Never the quitter, you must keep going, avoiding the police lap after lap.  <br/><br/>How long can you prove you're the best and avoid capture? The game starts with multiple cops following you on an enclosed race track. You and the cops are going opposite directions. Simply tap the screen if they get into your lane to avoid them.
