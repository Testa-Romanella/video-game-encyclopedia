Each building gives or costs money when it's placed, you will also get bonuses depending on what's around it.</p>\n<p>If the standard map is too small for you, there's also the big map and the extra-large map!</p>\n<p>You can also choose the visual theme of your city: modern cities will have factories, schools, police stations and so on delivered by helicopter, medieval towns are being helped by a flying godly hand, and the ancient Egyptians use slaves to build pyramids, temples and work in the fields!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/702aa76166daed97f8d75aa839114a20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fynn Tavvar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
