This is both our first game jam entry, and our first game ever. It was made in Godot 3.2. We enjoyed making this over the weekend, and can see potential in this as a simple puzzle game, if more complex interactions and ideas were to be implemented - which may happen down the line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback welcome. Hope everybody enjoyed DJAM #4!</p>\n<p>PS. We had trouble getting this game to load in certain browsers\u00a0- just had to turn adblocker off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b74939b433ec2cd868371afdd84922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frequenter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
