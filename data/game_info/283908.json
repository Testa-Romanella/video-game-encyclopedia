Explore the environment to find out what is going on and solve puzzles to be able to escape the place.</p>\n<p>The game you will solve puzzles and will try to avoid terrible enemies, that will follow you on sight, using patience while finding the best path for not being detected.</p>\n<p>The visuals is a blend between the pixelated style\u00a0from the\u00a0classic 5th generation of consoles and modern technology effects, I wanted to test and\u00a0bring the classic old feeling back to our projects but using moder shaders and fxs. This was a small project I developed in 2016 for mobile, this is an updated version for PC. Please, leave a feedback.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for playing,\r\nplease enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b0ad2b75cb4124a9dee398052793a2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["renatoaruffo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
