So the human race set out to develop an organism that would grant them unlimited power, they called it Animus. The experiment didn't work, and it would destroy any humans surrounding it. So humanity made Pooch, High Tower and other anthropomorphic super-soldiers to defend themselves against this threat. Animus was defeated and sent away, but that was years ago. He's back, and he's looking for revenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T10:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf0c7684a458ab15409ccf67b6b9a77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GravareGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
