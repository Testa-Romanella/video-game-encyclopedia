Now your soul is split in two, trapped on two separate memory grids. Above, a reserved memory grid located at the memory address A5, and below, the grid residing at address S0.</p>\n<p>The master control program has dispatched soul deleters to clear up the mess, but as a sentient being you're going to want to do everything you can to remain sentient and, perhaps one day, restore your soul back to a single entity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your half-souls are able to send out bursts of karma, capable of destroying soul deleters.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Point your right controller where you would like to direct the karma. Avoid ALL contact between your half-souls and the soul deleters. Hit them and your soul will be deleted.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Move both halves of your soul by pointing the left controller where you would like them to move, but you are only able to emit karma from one half-soul at a time. Point the right controller up or down\u00a0toward the memory grid holding the soul you want to emit from.</li></ul>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the first I've ever made in Unreal!\u00a0This is my entry to the Epic Mega Jam game jam 2022, made over 7 days.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>List any content that was created before the jam:</strong></p>\n<p>Music:<br/>In-Game: Cortexiphan from dynamedion / we love indies<br/>Menu: Stranger Synths III by\u00a0Liam Back / licenced from Audiio.com</p>\n<p>Everything else was created by me!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb812766c44f0d6ee067351d7abb27b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["psychicparrot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
