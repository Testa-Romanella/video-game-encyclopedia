Thus, it probably has a lot of bugs \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n\n<p>The game is quite simple:</p>\n\n<p>You shoot to blow up asteroids, and that gives you points. Just like the original. If you run out of lives (Top-Left), you end your run.</p>\n<p>It should only work on PC. If it for some reason works on any other platform, I'd be very surprised.<br/></p>\n<p>Just don't turn on turbo-mode in the settings.</p>\n\n<p>That should be everything. Enjoy 5 minutes of bare-bones gameplay :D<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * also, music's from here</em><br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEhhn8-IX04</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T09:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417c6f16e51646f7f651293bf64f741f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Earthy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
