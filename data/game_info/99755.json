All it features is the tutorial section which teaches you the basics of how the game WOULD play, and a shareware demo-esque lock at the first BBS. </p><p><strong>\uff23\uff4f\uff4e\uff54\uff52\uff4f\uff4c\uff53</strong></p><p>Keyboard - Everything.</p><p>Use the in game help command to get a list of actions if you forget, or do the tutorial again.</p><p>Ludum dare page: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/retrohacker-1993</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/610/61011278cf1af81ec7858c2006797a6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flatgub"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
