Tarrecite is the second project I've worked on and I'm so excited to be able to share it with you. I'm only a year into my journey as an indie game designer but I feel like this game will be the one that I take to a full release. The game engine I'm using, Pixel Game Make MV, is super simple and perfect for someone like me, who has no coding experience but a massive imagination and the drive to bring my ideas to life.<br/>I'll be working on Tarrecite in all of my free time over the coming years, with the hope of bringing it to retail, most likely Steam. By playing and sharing your feedback with me, I'll be able to shape this into the game I know it can be. <br/>My future plans include another full tier of weapon upgrades, bringing the total weapon types to 85! Six total raid missions, each with a unique tile set, objective, atmosphere, and boss battle. As well as new endless modes, enemies, upgrades, and,\u00a0 of course, 4-Player compatibility.<br/>Thanks again for checking out this project and I hope you have as much fun playing as I had making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T16:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087e7ccf17b0b5cd35cdafc5c9f1726e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nerdy Dude Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
