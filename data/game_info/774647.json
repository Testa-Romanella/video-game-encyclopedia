Who said we'd ever go\r\nalong with your little games? I'd personally rather die\r\nthan kill someone innocent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said any of you were innocent, huhhh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Innocent until proven guilty! I'm not going along with this!\r\nI'm going to find a way out of this hell hole, and there's no\r\nstopping me!\"\r\n<p> <em>OUTFOX stars Keitaro Meishu, a down on his luck police officer who receives a strange invitation to a new history museum. It turns out to be a trap, and now he and thirteen others are locked inside with no way out. Well- there is one way out. Everyone must draw a card from a randomized machine: thirteen sheep and one fox card rest inside. If you draw the fox card, you must kill someone else within three days' time, or face the deadly</em><em>\u00a0consequences. If you manage to kill without being caught and face the Hunting Grounds Games, you may leave alone while one at random receives punishment in your place.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Over the course of your stay in the World's History Museum, Keitaro will grow closer to the fourteen others he is trapped with. If you play your cards right, maybe you will gain yourself a powerful ally, or even something more. Not every choice is the right answer, so put your detective caps on and let us get right into the nitty-gritty!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Featuring:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-A Fully Playable Prologue Demo!<br/></p>\n<p>-Game Mechanics inspired by Danganronpa, The Werewolf Game, and Escape the Night</p>\n<p>-An LGBTQ+ and POC inclusive cast, including the protagonist!</p>\n<p>-Awesome VAs and 6 Game Chapters</p>\n<p>-Original Soundtrack</p><p>-Fan Discord Server for Updates and Full Character Bios:\u00a0https://discord.gg/h367vRrBD3</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p><strong>Tony Bennett, B.E, Louis Armstrong created by:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>@\u00d8m\u0259\u011f\u00e6_Cruckles#5399 on Discord</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Quirrelll, <strong>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6P5l6DcDBtX2WIjGyOFpQ</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>VA Credits until real credit system is implemented:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Keitaro\u00a0Meishu: @Vali#9641 on Discord</p>\n<p>Axel Crooks: @Nathan#3367\u00a0on Discord</p>\n<p>Tony Bennett:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/fanofalotofthingstwitch, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Y-8SRrXm0kETbUXk1Ekhg</p>\n<p>Tanya Brookes: @Ch\u00ebrr\u00ffB\u00f8mb#5800 on Discord</p>\n<p>Louis Armstrong: @Flowe\u03b2oy \u09ce\u0b6d\u2e19#3610 on Discord</p>\n<p>Imelda Rufio: @Ooooyousoclumsygurl on Tiktok</p>\n<p>Mikey Delatrix:\u00a0Nasim Benelkour https://linktr.ee/NasimBenelkour</p>\n<p>Haruka Ryugazaki: Stelcher,\u00a0https://linktr.ee/Stelcher</p>\n<p>Matthew Watt: @\u00a0NuclearChef#6725 on Discord</p>\n<p>B.\u00a0E: Sean\u00a0Madson,\u00a0Website: http://www.seanmadson.com/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/SeanMadson CCC: https://www.castingcall.club/mdprime<br/></p>\n<p>Jack Jones:\u00a0@xzillinx on Tiktok<br/></p>\n<p>Maryanna Parker: @Cheezy_\u00d8m\u0259\u011f\u00e6_Cruckles#0966 on Discord, or CheezyCruckles right here on itch.io!<br/></p>\n<p>Rose Yamaji: @Joceyb23#4835 on Discord</p>\n<p>Dannie Taylor: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCntgTJDBfFP45iaXuLAv60Q</p>\n<p>The ADMINS:\u00a0@Cheezy_\u00d8m\u0259\u011f\u00e6_Cruckles#0966 on Discord, or CheezyCruckles right here on itch.io!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music Loops:</strong></p>\n<p>ShadyDave on Freesound</p>\n\n<p>StephieQueen on Freesound</p>\n<p>Nicholas The Octopus Camarena on Freesound</p>\n<p>Migfus20 on Freesound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T23:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e31fa959a90935a9246822628d8a64b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CheezyCruckles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
