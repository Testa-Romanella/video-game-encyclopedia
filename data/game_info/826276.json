ANYTHING TO STOP THE DROIDS!!!</p>\n<p>We took the GameJam topic of Decoy, and thought about enemies using decoys to survive longer. \u00a0Sprinkle in a little shadow clone magic and here we have Rampage of The Decoy Droids.</p>\n<p>We focused on the\u00a0 idea of \"distraction\u00a0 with decoys\"\u00a0 when designing\u00a0 the gameplay.\u00a0 We wanted the enemies to protect themselves using decoys, not only as bullet shields, but also to obscure the player's view. We also tried to balance the amount of enemies to draw the player's attention as they build up in numbers on screen.<br/></p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>1.
