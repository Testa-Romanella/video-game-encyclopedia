I already had kind of an image in my head of the kind of game I wanted to make. I could probably have done more to make the powerups\u00a0 'stranger' but still really happy with how my first jam went!</p>\n<p>//The modifier was an art style you haven't used before, which did help with the process of creating this art even though\u00a0I normally do pixel art. I tried to use looser lines and a different color style.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T03:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea4bcb65ad59b4d0477b04aa69f5b368.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtilleryOrange"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
