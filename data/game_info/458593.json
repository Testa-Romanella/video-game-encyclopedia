You can heal yourself by picking up the green healthdrops scattered around the arena. Once you have collected 100 XP points you will be Supernova and have won the game. Whether you win or die, the round will automatically restart. You can quit at any time via the pause menu by pressing the Escape key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SUPERNOVA was made as a graduation project during my study of Multimedia Technology: Virtual &amp; 3D at the Karel de Grote University College. During this project I researched some more advanced techniques in game development like procedural mesh generation, procedural animation, inverse kinematics and others.</p>\n<p>The main feature of SUPERNOVA is the IK (Inverse Kinematic) rig. The player character and enemies are proceduraly animated, which means all movement and animations are steered by scripting and physics without any keyframed animations. In theory the IK rig allows the character to change its dimensions and appearance without the need to alter any animations. Currently the IK rig only supports a procedural walking animation, which is still being refined.</p>\n<p>Another feature in SUPERNOVA is procedural terrain generation based on mesh generation. The arena floor is procedurally generated at the start of each round. This ensures a random and unique terrain during each play session.</p>\n\n<p>Please enjoy SUPERNOVA!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T05:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa37e2380b60daaab3c0391190bc4b01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LennertS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
