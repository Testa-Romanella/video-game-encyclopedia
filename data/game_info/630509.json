This is the only layer the player can move. In order to move another layer, the player needs to bring it to the top by rotating the cube. This can be done by pressing\u00a0Select. Some circular arrows will appear. They show the axis around which the cube will be rotated. Press\u00a0Select\u00a0again in order to reveal other pair of circular arrows. Press\u00a0Left/Right\u00a0to move the cube around the chosen axis. Press\u00a0B\u00a0to hide the circular arrows and the top layer can be rotated again.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is a pause menu, which can be displayed by pressing the\u00a0Start\u00a0button. The options included are:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Reset\u00a0the cube's configuration;\r\n</li><li>get back to the\u00a0Title\u00a0screen.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>No reward for solving the cube currently. Not even a\u00a0Well done!\u00a0message. This will be probably added in one of the next versions.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are two game modes :\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Normal : the program shuffles the cube and you have to solve it;\r\n</li><li>Freestyle : start from an already solved cube and try to experiment things and learn techniques in your own way.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Game tests are required\u00a0to assure the mechanics correctitude and reliability (for example, detect and solve a wrong color mapping on cube rotation). Preferably by someone who has a bit of experience with solving this little thing. (Yeah, you got me: I suck at puzzles and strategy games :) ). Help &amp; advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated.\r\n</p>\n<p>Screenshots</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Linked</p>\n<ul><li>visit\u00a0HomebrewOwl.GB\u00a0to check out my other Gameboy projects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T17:50:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a0d4b1dcae9e85db6c149a6fe30a6c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotImplementedLife"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
