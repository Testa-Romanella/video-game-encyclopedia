The independent study was in hand tracking and was a way for me to explore and learn about the new VR hand-tracking capabilities of the Oculus Quest 2. For this project, I focused on gesture recognition and essentially created a game of Rock Paper Scissors in VR! In this game, you will be facing an AI opponent in rock paper scissors and at the end of each round, you will give them a thumbs up to start the next round. It plays to the first player to reach 3 points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T17:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/1866a3867b23be32c27818445111e586.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["WesMcW"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
