The player traverses through each section of the house and in each room trying to find where the noise is coming from. Once the noise is found the player must decipher what is making the horrendous noise. Eventually The Growl reveals itself through demonic symbols such as broken crucifixes, flipped crucifixes, pentagonal circles, freezing temperatures and flickering lights. Only when The Growl decides to kill the player does it reveal its physical form.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T17:30:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b061c7bba7391bb2b072d47805c09ee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoCk0104"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
