After finding a massive arm that works as a grappling hook, it allows Teak to explore into and through places he or his people have never been. In this demo you are trying to get to the top of your mother tree Abre. From there you will be able to use the wooden cogs you have collected to unlock other levels. Guided by the scrolls left behind by an explorer before Teak, you are guided through the world to discover the dark things happen in the forest.</p><p>This game was made as part of a class at UW-Whitewater.</p><p>Credits:\u00a0Brandon Korth, Brian Maresso, Jamie Sandberg, Cody Castona, Colin Onken</p><p>Special Thanks: Andrew Berghammer, Cutter Waller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d4c09456c063212e340320c68314108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GAMED"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
