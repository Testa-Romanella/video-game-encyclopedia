Gameplay is similar to\u00a0Missle Command Game made by Atari. So, basically, you need to destroy enemy rockets before they will reach the city(houses next to your air defence). You can allow 3 rockets to explode. If 4 will reach it's goal, the game is over.</p>\n<p>It's an infinite\u00a0type of game.</p>\n<p>And also while I was playing that game before i upload it there, I noticed, that there is a big difficulty spike from easy to very hard and sometimes even impossible(waves of rockets and your firerate is very limited, so you either need be lucky or very quick)</p>\n<p>But\u00a0 in this game first time I was fiddling around with rotations and mouse input.\u00a0 And the game window is not covering entire screen space in full screen, because I believe, that I've not setted up a proper resolution there. So the main game window is in the center.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674312e599865e26b699f8e9600a3af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Don Kyniu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
