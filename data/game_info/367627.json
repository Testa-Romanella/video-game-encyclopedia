Just be careful not to get punished for misusing your dash as there is a cool-down.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game has been a personal project that I've been working on for just about a month now. This is my first ever full game that I have ever created and was excited to see it come close to being finished.</p>\n<p>My goal was to start a project and actually finish it as I've not done that before, I usually always lose motivation shortly after starting the project and I never see it finished. I would appreciate feedback more than you know as I only want to improve my work. Donations are very welcome as it would help me find time to work on more games like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks again,</p>\n<p>Salaro</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:41:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2eef3dad103ba6ed86896c80ac77a848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Salaro"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
