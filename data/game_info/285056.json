We are sorry, luck will NOT help you.<br/><br/>Bipolarity has THREE game modes:<br/><br/>- Endless: You will play on a random map, so every game will be different. Will you dare to run across the 16.040 parsecs of this level? We do not think so, but sure you will beat your friends.<br/><br/>- Challenge: Try the the different challenges we have prepared for you. But don't be confident of the easiness of the first two ones, the other six will drive you crazy!<br/><br/>- Training: In this mode you will learn how to master every stretch of the Endless mode.<br/><br/>Collect orbs during the levels, not only let you slow down a bit,  you can use them to unlock new color combinations (polarities) and new drone shapes. But be careful, you can only pick an orb if it has the same polarity as you, otherwise you will explode.<br/><br/>And don't forget: Avoid the walls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d7052860d596067c522e322ae3bb6e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["NO2 Web and Mobile Applications"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["NO2 Web and Mobile Applications"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
