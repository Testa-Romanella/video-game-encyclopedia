{"id": 103901, "slug": "irrational-karate", "name": "Irrational Karate", "name_original": "Irrational Karate", "description": "Description\r\n<p>\r\nIrrational Karate is a fighting game for people that like the idea of beat em ups but were never really good enough to play them. It's a game for people that enjoy mercilessly thumping their enemies but wished it could all look cuter. Mostly, though, it's a game originally created for Bitgem's 9th Game Jam.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nDespite the game jam being over\u00a0<em>(and <strong>Irrational Karate</strong> placing <strong>1st</strong> - wooh!)</em>, my work on this game is not. Having teamed up with the talented guys at Bitgem, we're\u00a0looking to continue development and expand the content, clean up any remaining rough edges, and release on more platforms. I'll keep the dev log posted with updates as they happen and will upload new builds as and when sensible milestones are reached.</p>\n<p>\r\nIrrational Karate is currently free (genuinely free - no ads, and please feel free to share it with people), but any donations are incredibly welcome as they'll directly help fund further development on this and\u00a0other current and future projects.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\r\nP.S.
