I'd ignored recent events that should have been warning shots across the bow of my soul, from my wife's brush with death to the anti-pirate ramblings of an Australian gazillionaire. If only I'd chosen a different path, LeChuck might still be dead and the Ultimate Insult might have remained a mystery. If I'd never picked up a sword, the grog-swilling pirates of the Tri-Island Area might be unthreatened by the forces of gentrification and demonic heckfire. If only... suddenly, the hairy finger of a familiar monkey tapped me on the shoulder. It was time. Time for the biggest battle of my swashbuckling life. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Excerpted from \"The Memoirs of Guybrush Threepwood: The Monkey Island Years\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFourth in the legendary Monkey Island series of graphic adventures!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 An original, cinematic story full of drama, sociopathic parrots, and a villain with a sinister agenda!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Dozens of lusciously rendered backgrounds!<br/>\r\nHundreds of puzzles to challenge both novice and veteran pirates... er, adventurers!<br/>\r\n\u2022 New jokes!
