It uses a very basic programming language to recreate various mathematical functions, based on the 72 pre-made Graphs. You can also have fun in Sandbox Mode, creating whatever your heart desires!</p>\n<p>For the moment, the SHR-OS Emulator only contains this program - we'll see if my commissioner asks me to do any other ones!</p>\n<p>I included a copy of the original HI-216 Manual, but also take a look at the Readme for more info about using the emulator (it's pretty simple). I also included, according to my commissioner's request, an early copy of Minnisoda's Technical Revelations that he sent me; if you want to listen to the final album (and possibly buy it), it's here:\u00a0https://89odev.bandcamp.com/album/minnisodas-technical-revelations</p>\n<p>There's not much else for me to say here! Just have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T09:54:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5082a992e34313c8899f7f6e7f58ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
