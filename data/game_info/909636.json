Space promags around the world have decided to send probes out to the greater reaches of\u00a0space to find hospitable planets for humans to colonize. One such probe is the SpIder probe, an eight legged rover resembling the common house pest. With the ability to manipulate it's own gravity, the SpIder can cling on to the surface of anything, making it ideal to traverse through the environments of all kinds of different planets. However before the SpIder can even be sent out, it must be able to navigate through a series of field tests that the scientists have devised for it. Will SpIder be able to complete these tests?</p>\n<p>_____________________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>WASD:\u00a0</strong>Move character\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Space:</strong>\u00a0Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Esc:</strong>\u00a0Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T19:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fccd6f4f9d12c442deb455102e9179a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AndyOfEarth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
