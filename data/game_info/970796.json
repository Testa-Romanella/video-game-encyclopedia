Thanks to a high-tech gun known as the Impulser, you have the ability to grab objects from a distance and repel them with force. You must survive against waves of enemies armed with only this gun and the weapons of the environment. Stay on the move as you burn, electrocute, and explode your enemies using various explosives, slice them in half with a sawblade, and paint the level red with their blood. See how long you can last!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was developed as a side project by a team of 4 people.
