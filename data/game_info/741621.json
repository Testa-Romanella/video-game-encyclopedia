It was in development for around a year and a half before its release date on November 1st, 2012.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a forum known as the Chaos Theatre. A war between the administrators and the moderators has broken out. There used to be roughly thirty mods, but now only four remain. Prelich is one of them. After awakening in an icy cave, he&#39;s told by super moderator Camelslayer to hunt down and ban the administrators. Upon his journey, he is joined by bruiser mod Magnum, magic-user mod Vlarix, and (about two dungeons later) demoted mod Tambot in order to take down the rulers of the Chaos Theatre. The not-so-stalwart quartet soon embark on a very silly adventure parodying early RPG games.</p>\n<p>The game is, in fact, based around an actual forum called &quot;The Chaos Theatre&quot;, which ran from 2011 to 2017, and all of the users, moderators and admins featured in the game are based off select users from the actual forum. Despite this, knowing the forum&#39;s history is not required to fully enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>An Updated Re-release titled Forum Fantasy: Prelich&#39;s Journey to Manhood: Kraken Edition was released on December 19, 2014. In addition to using the RPG Maker VX Ace engine, it also added more sidequests, an extra Bonus Dungeon, and more Bonus Bosses in addition to changing several things from the original.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T01:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1fb6f621371c832da1072d849d595e.jpg", "website": "https://camelslayer.blogspot.com/2014/12/forum-fantasy-updated.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
