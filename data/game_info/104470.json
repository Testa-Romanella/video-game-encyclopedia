It counted amongst its members the likes of Aleister Crowley and W.B. Yeats. To become a member one must first have discovered the existence of the fraternity after which an invitation to join must have been extended. Upon accepting this invitation, one was initiated in a secret ritual designed to invoke occult energies.</p>\n<p>This is a faithful recreation that first ritual the \"Neophyte 0=0 Grade\" as it is described in Israel Regardie's book \"The Golden Dawn\". All of the speaking roles are fully voiced by experienced members of the Seattle occult community.</p>\n<p>You can witness the ceremony as it was intended to be first viewed - through the eyes of the candidate - or you can inhabit the body of any of the officers including several of the so called \"invisible officers\" giving you a giant's view of the proceedings. One of the view points allows you to walk around the temple room during the ritual to grab and inspect the various weapons and objects.</p>\n<p>As a VR experience this currently only works with the Oculus Rift, a Vive version might be forth coming once we get access to a Vive to develop on :)</p>\n<p>This executable also works on PC *without* a VR setup. Just download and run as normal with FPS type controls as indicated below. A Mac version is also in the works.</p>\n<p>There is a <strong>demo</strong> version (all the way at the bottom of this screen) that contains only the opening of the ritual, which doesn't involve the candidate in any way. We've provided it for those that just want to see the temple or just want to see if this works on their computer. If you want to first be exposed to the temple as the candidate you would want to go straight for the full version.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*** Controls ***</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Oculus touch or Xbox controllers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tA: Skip current vocal or action.

Try to use this sparingly or you will get nauseous.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLeft and Right Hand Triggers (not the index buttons) Use these to grab most objects in the temple.
