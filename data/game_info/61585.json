{"id": 61585, "slug": "reigns-game-of-thrones", "name": "Reigns: Game of Thrones", "name_original": "Reigns: Game of Thrones", "description": "<p>Reigns: Game of Thrones is the third installment of the Reigns mobile game series and the first to be based on the popular fantasy TV series Game of Thrones.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The player takes control over one of the leaders in the medieval world of Westeros. At the start of the game, he or she assumes the role of Daenerys Targaryen, while other characters, including Tyrion and Cersei Lannister, as well as Sansa Stark, and Jon Snow, have to be unlocked as the player progresses in the game. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game combines elements of a strategy and a visual novel. A term \u201cswipe &#39;em up\u201d was coined for the Reigns gameplay model, which is somewhat similar to a game book. The player faces other characters, dialogue options, and situations, and has to make difficult decisions. There are always two options to deal with each situation, and the player can swipe the screen right to choose one option or left to choose the other. </p>\n<p>The choices he or she makes affect the plot and the state of his or her kingdom. The game informs the player which factors his or her decision will affect, however, it does not specify in details which consequences it may provoke. Ill-considered decisions can lead the main character and his or her faction to defeat and even a grisly death.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game features simple and somewhat comical portrayals of the Game of Thrones characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T22:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f88/f88c1db527f668a6cd875425f1a08d67.jpg", "website": "http://www.reignsgame.com", "rating": 3.48, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 296, "beaten": 31, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 51, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 92, "platforms": ["macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Nerial"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "GHI Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
