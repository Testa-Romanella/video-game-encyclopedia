For your mandate, you need to choose the species of fish you want to breed (there are more than fifteen species to choose from) and rule over your Aquarium. In each game turn you can buy and sell land for seaweeds, you can allocate seaweeds to feed your fishes and use the rest of the seaweeds to plant your land.<br/><br/>The key to successfully govern the Aquarium is to balance fish population demands with available crops. You need to respect the international rules for seeding acres of land in relation to the total fish population, manage the jellyfishes problem and other random events, like tropical storms and plagues.<br/><br/>Find the optimal balance to manage your aquarium and you\u00edll receive the accolades of animalist organizations. Manage poorly and you'll be fired!<br/><br/>...will you be able to maintain your job?<br/><br/>The game supports background iPod music. Enjoy your own favourite soundtrack while playing the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T05:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b441654c54f93b2f8f363a85f326e6bd.jpg", "website": "http://www.dighentis.com/applications.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alessandro Benedettini"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Alessandro Benedettini"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
