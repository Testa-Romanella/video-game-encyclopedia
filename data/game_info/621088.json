You progress by killing all the red squares and avoiding all of the blue squares. You kill squares by making them touch the line connection between both squares. This game is intended for 2 players but can be played by a single lonely individual</p>\n<p>This is my short submission for the GMTK 2021. I only recently started dabbling at game dev and this was my first game jam. Overall I liked it and learned a few things. I am sure that this idea will be used in a lot of games, but I kid you not, I got an idea for a similar game involving this line mechanic that I wanted to work on anyway, so I decided to start on it in this jam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a4bd1cbd3a9dd178c0a881825786e4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DvorakDwarf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
