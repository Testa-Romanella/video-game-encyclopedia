Occasionally, as in most rpgs, you will have a random encounters. These random encounters are really basic, you just press ctrl, and shoot, at the enemy. A good strategy is just to spam the bullets, so it's not very advanced. I could have gone with a regular combat system, but i figured it would be easier to do what he have now. Besides, this really isn't about the combat for me. I made this, so i could practice level generation. You can visit villages, witch's location is randomized. They're essentially all the same town, but with a different name. You can buy items there, and walk around, in an unfinished village map. You can leave that place by walking out the screen. There is no goal, since it's mostly just practice for me, but that doesn't mean nobody will find it enjoyable.</p>\n<p>--- Controls ----</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>CTRL - Interact (towns, fighting)</p>\n<p>Escape - Menu</p>\n<p>Shift - Developer Console (Cheats)</p>\n<p>---Cheats and Commands---</p>\n<p>Press shift, and you can type in the following.</p>\n<p>\"mon\" for money</p>\n<p>\"lvl\" for levels</p>\n<p>\"xp\" for experience</p>\n<p>\"shop\" to visit a town</p>\n<p>\"dev\" to stop random encounters</p>\n<p>and \"battle\" to start a random encounter.</p>\n<p>*These commands are meant to be used without the quotations.
