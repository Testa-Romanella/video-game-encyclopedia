The idea is to leverage the modern rendering techniques and scripting capabilities from Unity Engine to give the MMD community a powerful viewer for them to enjoy their content on both desktop platforms and VR.\u00a0</p>\n<p>DVVR is not yet-another ordinary MMD player. In addition to loading the model and playing the motion, we have tons of hard work put in to handling the model &amp; motion in real-time, to ensure the best outcome possible.\u00a0<br/>* We broke the barrier between different model poses, T pose or A pose all work fine with any motion you find.\u00a0<br/>* We fix bone structures on the fly, missing IK or wrong center position? No issue at all!<br/>* In addition to PMX models, we also support XPS models, they are usually better quality and more realistic than traditional PMXs. No conversion required!<br/>* Floor penatraiton? Not an issue any more! We implemented a robust algorithm to keep feet on the floor on every frame!<br/>* We use a custom made IK solver to eliminate jittering and allow for motion blending &amp; post processes for pose modifiers.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, we also have lots of addons &amp; modifiers to enhance the experience<br/>* Easy adjustable lighting &amp; environment control<br/>* Models makes eye contact with viewer automatically<br/>* They blink, breath and makes micro movements like a real human does<br/>* Material modifiers for special effect like latex, chrome &amp; glossness adjustments<br/>* Controllable pose modifiers that blends motion on the fly</p>\n<p>And there are more coming with each release!</p>\n<p>For detailed documentation &amp; setup instructions, please visit\u00a0https://github.com/alloystorm/dvvr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8b507d56fa5e4a6fa440c5e18847a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alloystorm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
