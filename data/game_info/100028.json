{"id": 100028, "slug": "toadies-adventure", "name": "Toadie's Adventure", "name_original": "Toadie's Adventure", "description": "<p>Emperor Ribbit, the ruler of Ribbit Island, holds a grudge against the creatures of the Green Isles. Having readied his attack, he invades the isles with his ship. Toadie, a small frog-like creature with special abilities, witnesses what\u2019s happening and decides to stop Ribbit himself.</p>\r\nWhat is Toadie's Adventure?\r\n<p>Toadie's Adventure is a small 2D platformer, where you play as Toadie, a frog who has the ability to copy the abilities of his enemies. By hitting them with his tongue, he can access different forms and use abilities such as fire, ice, and more. Abilities offer different movesets, which also means more attacks to use.</p>\n\n<p>Toadie's Adventure is currently in development. It's a short game, so hopefully it will release in the near future. When it does, the game will be free to download (with optional donation included).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Do you like this game?
