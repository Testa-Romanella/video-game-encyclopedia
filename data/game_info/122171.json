{"id": 122171, "slug": "trader", "name": "Trader", "name_original": "Trader", "description": "<p>Trader is a simple simulation game meant to give you all the thrill of being a Wall Street broker at a fraction of the financial risk. The game is very simple: three companies, three stock prices, three colours. On top of the screen is a candlestick graph of their price history as it unfolds (if you're curious about these and how they work, look them up); on the bottom, new deals roll in all the time. You can buy and sell in fixed amounts by swiping the deals right, or discard them by swiping left (so you can make room for more). Objective: make money! But pay attention - when a stock stays very low for a long time there's a risk of default, which will make you lose part of the titles you own, while when it stays very high it might pay off dividends, so don't be too quick to sell it!</p><p>The game is still in alpha, so it has no set objective or game over condition. I have plans about those though. It's designed for Android but you can play it on a PC as well in windowed mode.</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Swipe (or click and drag) right on a deal: accept deal</li><li>Swipe (or click and drag) left on a deal: discard deal</li><li>Click on bottom button (or press ESC): pause menu</li></ul><p>Top left is your amount of money, top right how many you own of each stock. When a default happens, the corresponding number will flash red and be covered by a cross; similarly, with dividends, it'll flash green and show a sign of a dollar. The news bar under the graph rolls numerical values for the prices continuously.</p><p>This game was made in Godot Engine.
