Can you become a millionaire? (Game runs out of upgrades at that point)</p>\n<p>The big ladybug button is the one to click to start collecting, but first you need to \"buy\" an upgrade or two so that you can actually do something with the ladybugs! Upgrades are available on the Left side of the screen below the ladybug button.</p>\n<p>I had so many ideas for things to add but in the end I procrastinated too much and this is where we're at. I might revisit this in the future to add more, including:</p>\n<ul><li>More upgrades</li><li>Tooltips that show what you're buying, a little description, and the cost</li><li>Consistent art style (no more mixing outlines and no outlines!)</li><li>Animations</li><li>Particles and animation to actually show the ladybirds</li><li>Sound and music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T10:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/986e5ffd7b78f041fbfa85ddf29efe66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fried Yeti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
