You cannot press accept on a drink until the glass is full. If you exit the screen the drink will still wait for you to finish it when you come back.<br/>2. You must get girls 4 correct drinks to win.<br/>3. If you get any drink wrong, that girl will no longer talk to you, and you will need to start over with another.<br/>4.
