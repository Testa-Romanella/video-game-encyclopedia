You have to scramble to find active nodes to delay the inevitable.\u00a0 Eventually, the ceiling will close off and fall on you.\u00a0 While managing this, you also have to fight off a horde of dead slimes who have died before you.\u00a0 They close in fast and overwhelm quickly if not dealt with. <br/></p>\n<br/>How to play\r\n<p><strong>THERE IS A TUTORIAL IN GAME. \u00a0IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT \u00a0YOU PLAY THE TUTORIAL<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Keyboard and Mouse. No Gamepad.<br/>Esc will pause the game \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong><br/>You can move using the Up, Down, Left, or Right arrow keys, or WSAD on your keyboard. \u00a0<br/>Holding Shift will allow you to move faster\u00a0\u00a0 <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Attack</strong><br/>Pressing Left Click on mouse will allow you to swing your sword to attack. You attack in the direction you are facing. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to win</strong><br/>As the ceiling closes in, nodes will become active.\u00a0 Standing on an active node will push the walls back, but only if you have energy to do so. Energy is gained by killing enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Can you survive?\u00a0 Is it possible? Will you eventually die? Find out.</p>\r\nTools Used\u00a0 \r\n<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong><br/>\"Squish\" sound effect was recorded with Audacity, and the vocal provided by my friend ehrgeiziges</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics</strong><br/>Graphics were done using Aseprite https://www.aseprite.org</p>\n<p><strong>Level Maps</strong><br/>Level maps were created using OGMO Editor www.ogmoeditor.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Frameworks</strong><br/>The primary framework used is the MonoGame framework. http://www.monogame.net/</p>\n<p>Along with that, I have a custom framework called Psiren which is a combination of my own code and Monocle \u00a0<br/><strong>Psiren</strong>: https://gitlab.com/manbeardgames/Psiren \u00a0<br/><strong>Monocle</strong>: https://bitbucket.org/MattThorson/monocle-engine</p>\n<p>And lastly, I used MonoGame Extended for Bitmap importing. https://craftworkgames.github.io/MonoGame.Extended/</p>\n<br/>Notes\r\n<p>I'm submitting to jam, but this was a solo endeavor.\u00a0 The only assets I was unable to create my own was the music, as usual.\u00a0 There is music in the game, I just didn't make it. Credits to music are below.\u00a0 As such, I am removing the **Audio** category for voting. \u00a0</p>\n<br/>Music Credits\r\n<p><strong>Title Music</strong><br/>\"Man Down\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Game Music</strong><br/>\"Grim Idol\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>Change Log<p><strong>This fix was made at 5:50 PM EDT: 10 minutes before time closed for page submission. \u00a0 There was a small audio bug in the game where the background music would not loop, it would play once and stop. \u00a0It was a simple \"IsLooping = true\" adjustment. No other changes were made to the game except this. \u00a0As such, I have provided two downloads for the game. The one I uploaded at ~4am Monday morning that has the audio non-looping, and the one I'm uploading now at 5:50 PM Monday, 10 minutes before submissions close.<br/></strong></p><p>Even though I have opted out of the audio category for Ludum, I wanted to be completely transparent about this. \u00a0Again, there is no difference between the original build and the audio fix build except the one line of code telling the audio to repeat.
