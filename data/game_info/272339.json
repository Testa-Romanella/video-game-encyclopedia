In order to find the correct key for keypad, you have to compare the first letter of each name to the E-board located on the nearby wall.

The machine will give you the final clue, so you must go to the painting located at the end of the corridor.</p>\n<p>The painting will then open up a secret path directly below you. There you\u2019ll find another room that has a big eye in it. Interact with it and Mina will comment that there\u2019s a room behind the eye.
