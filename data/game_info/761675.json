The garbage will steadily build up, but try to hold it off as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Use ASDF to open and close the different trash-sorting bins, and SPACE to run the piston at the bottom. The trash bins will automatically process trash once they are filled up. They process faster or slower depending on how similar in color the bin's trash is.\u00a0 For example, an bin filled with just blue and cyan will go faster than one filled with all 6 colors equally.</p>\n<p>Reset game, toggle tutorial mode, and toggle sound are all available at the bottom-right.</p>\n<p>This is a Ludum Dare 50 submission for the Compo event. All assets, including art, code, and sound are made by me, with the exception of the font, Retro Gaming font (https://www.dafont.com/retro-gaming.font)</p>\n<p>Note: The current version here contains some minor quality-of-life fixes, and\u00a0was submitted after the submission deadline.
