{"id": 892341, "slug": "life-lamp", "name": "Life Lamp", "name_original": "Life Lamp", "description": "<p>Follow Joey, a kid who is sleepwalking with a corrupted view of the world around him, as he tries his best to escape to the comforts of his home. Follow him through the two current levels as he weaves he way past monsters to get home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls for the game can be chosen between two options: WASD and H or Arrow Keys and Z. H and Z correspond to the hiding ability joey has when going over the wood floor. After you have selected your controls, the aim is to explore the level searching for the red door which will take you further out of Joey's nightmare. Along the way, you will encounter monsters who deal damage when contacted with. Joey does regain health over time but can be easily overwhelmed if stuck with multiple monsters.</p>\n\n<p>***FOR RUNNING GAME, download and running the .exe and then select the data.win file***</p>\n\n<p>Post-mortem: The overall concept changed as we worked on the game but the core hiding mechanic stayed. We had to update just to make sure we weren't stretching ourselves thin this semester with our other courses.\u00a0We were developing with the help of the class slides which was great to give us a structure to build off of. However, we did run into a few times where we had something in place, such as movement, get replaced by a better system presented. It would eventually save us headaches but we realized that we could have better planned some of the smaller-scale aspects of the game on top of the overarching game design.\u00a0GitHub was another issue, just a lot of problems keeping the project up to date between everyone using GitHub. We eventually resorted to emailing it around as it produced fewer errors leading up to the due date. Regarding changes made, we trimmed down the story to just the horror levels and didn\u2019t pursue the house aspect of the game. This was mostly due to time constraints and wanting to focus more on core mechanics and a solid base game. Also, there was a\u00a0reduction to some\u00a0of the mechanics we had originally planned. This mainly compromised of the hammer being used as a weapon by Joey. This was cut because we felt that it would be better to focus our efforts rather than spreading ourselves thin, making a better core game than trying to build out extra features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1d7fc61a92414b76ef4e2f51618b3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["josemhs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
