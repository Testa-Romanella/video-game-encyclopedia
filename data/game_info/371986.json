I had the idea for a 2D platformer played on a 3D cube\u00a0in middle school. I tried on multiple occasions, but could not figure out how to actually create my idea. Turns out Scratch wasn't intended for 3D games. I gave up. Eventually the time had come where I had\u00a0outgrew Scratch. But I knew couldn't leave until I created the idea that I spent years dreaming of. ^3 was released in my senior year of high school, over 5 years after I initially thought of the idea.</p>\n<p>Upon it's release, ^3 went viral on Scratch, acquiring over 30,000 views and over 4,000 likes.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move: WASD / Arrow Keys<br/>Jump: W / Up Arrow<br/>Rewind: Z (hold)<br/>Reset: R<br/>Next Level: S / Down Arrow</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming / Design: AlphaAxle<br/>Music: Ketsa<br/>Triangle Filler Script: TheLogFather</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e19e576ad1aa2134fd0f1d3c29e43c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlphaAxle"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
