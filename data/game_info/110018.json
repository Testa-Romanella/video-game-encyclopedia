I want to develop a great RPG dungeon crawel game, but sadly with the limited resources I can't. This is only a fraction of a game I wanted to create. If this little game sales well I will buy the resource I need and make a better version and also upload it to steam, and every one who bought the original will get the updated version for free. Thanks to everyone for checking my game out!<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Adventure Meme\", \"8 Bit Dungeon Level\", \"Dungeon Boss\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0</p>\n<p>https://incompetech.com/wordpress/2014/12/adventure-meme/https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1200066https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1200065</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/2346e9fa9d56614af4cff1e7abcc8331.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrija"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
