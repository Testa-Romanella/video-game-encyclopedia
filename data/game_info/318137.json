Gameplay-wise it works by having two different worlds, between which the player can switch. Some objects are visible in both levels, while some only in one. The game introduces puzzles built around these mechanics.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf49af6aa2c59cd9531215a6237d2e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krist\u00f3f Morva"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
