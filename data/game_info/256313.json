{"id": 256313, "slug": "achromatic-2", "name": "Achromatic!", "name_original": "Achromatic!", "description": "Achromatic is a minimalist puzzle game about connecting dots in order to transform them all to one cohesive color. Draw a straight line between two dots of the same color to paint the dots between them. However, you can only change dots of one color at a time. You'll quickly encounter unique dots with exciting properties. For example the square dot lets you change the direction of your line, or the triangle dots are synchronized such that changing one of them changes all of them.<br/><br/>Achromatic features an original and relaxing sound track to accompany its polished minimalist aesthetic. Its smooth difficulty curve will teach you the mechanics and gently ease you into more difficult levels. All levels were carefully designed by hand to ensure the best puzzling experience possible. For those craving a challenge, bonus levels are available after beating the game to really test your logic skills.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>\u2022 60 handcrafted level plus 10 challenging bonus levels<br/>\u2022 Unique dots with special properties<br/>\u2022 An undo button to encourage experimentation and prevent frustration<br/>\u2022 Supports both vertical and horizontal orientation<br/>\u2022 Color blind mode<br/><br/>SUBSCRIPTION INFO:<br/><br/>Subscribe to play the game and many more!<br/>\u2022 The subscription gives you unlimited access to all the games offered in Playond and includes:<br/>\t- A lot of amazing games<br/>\t- Many hours of play time<br/>\t- New games added all the time<br/>\t- No ads or extra payments<br/>\u2022 Subscription length: weekly, monthly<br/>\u2022 Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.<br/>\u2022 You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.<br/>\u2022 Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.<br/>\u2022 The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.<br/>\u2022 When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.
