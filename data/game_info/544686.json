At the same time, Enthusi (Dr. Martin Wendt) was toying with the idea of entering a game into the RGCD 16KB Cartridge Development Competition but hadn't yet decided upon a particular design.</p>\n<p>After discussing a few ideas, a port of Photon Storm's excellent Quartet game was suggested. Playable online via the gimme5games flash portal, its simple design and frantic reflex-based gameplay made it a perfect contender for the limitations of the competition.</p>\n<p>In order to give the Commodore 64 conversion its own identity, we decided to christen the project with a new name: Assembloids. Conrad (Owen Crowley) was brought in at short notice to help with music and sound effects, being the logical choice following his excellent work on RGCD/Onslaught's Not Even Human.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, an initial build of the game was submitted to the judging panel of the RGCD 16KB Cartridge Game Development Compo, where it secured second place. This post-competition final retail version is the result of several more hours of work and features a number of tweaks and enhancements, further improving the game.</p>\n<p>Assembloids is a frantic reflex-based puzzle game in which you must assemble faces from four different sets as quickly as possible against an increasingly tight time limit.</p>\n<p>Featuring open border design, high-score codes so you can keep a record of your achievements and full (comparable speed) PAL/NTSC compatibility, Assembloids requires no keyboard input and is designed to work on the C64GS as well as regular Commodore computers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T05:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f66c18b88dc0d5731f5a4cebf7f05b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OnslaughtGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
