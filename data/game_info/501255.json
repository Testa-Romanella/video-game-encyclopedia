The game was inspired by dialogues in \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d and \u201cFallout New Vegas\u201d. It has a branching dialogue tree and 3 endings. The only way to win the game is to be honest with yourself.</p>\n<p>The game was created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 47 Compo by Stanislav Demchenko.</p>\n<p>I used some preexisting code written by myself for dialogues.
