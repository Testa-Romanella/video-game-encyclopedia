It is through navigation of a pitch black environment, management of light mana, and strategic ways of overcoming obstacles that will make this task possible.</p>\n<p>The FiveGuysNamedJim Team:</p>\n<p>Nicholas Junkas - Programmer and Designer<br/></p>\n<p> Anthony Drapeau - Artist and Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Mosaic Mind - Artist and Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Casey VandeHey - Programmer and Designer</p>\n<p>Font by: Maxi K\r\n    </p>\n<p>Maxi's Twitter  \r\n\r\n    </p>\n<p>Maxi's Fontstruct\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>*=-STORY-=*</p>\n<p>The world is a hostile place for a human to live. They cling to their Sunwells, great open grottos shot through with massive roots that carry sunlight from the surface. Although, none of them know that. None of them know that there <em>is</em> a surface. Their life is the caverns, the great, dark expanse of the endless underground. It is all they know; it is their world. But their world is dying. The simple fact of the matter is that the Sunwells cannot sustain the population. They most go deeper, deeper, to where the Sun Roots are fewer, smaller, farther between.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Deeper, deeper... where dark things sleep.</p>\n<p>They have left their world of light and life, and entered the realm of the Queen of Rot, and the Lord of Shade. Their footsteps violate the hallowed, shadowed halls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In SunRoot, you must take the role of Willow, a young Sun Mage- an adept at the art magic harnessed from the lifegiving light of the Sunroots- and traverse the unmapped caves, the halls of darkness. Your light is your sole source of magic, the only thing between you and a cold death. The only thing keeping the Shade at bay. The only means of defending yourself from the Fungus.</p>\n<p>The only way you can find a new home.</p>\n<p>So get a move on, son. You're burnin' daylight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:26:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/621d15c002447f769c3555721a3a5ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MundanePixel", "Mosaic Mind", "CreatureBox", "KChicken"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
