Our camera movement system was often too sensitive and hard to focus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camera would also pass through walls, making interior enviornments difficult to create. We also lacked the time and ability to include music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>We also struggled to with gravity and making the character move up and down slopes. With not enough gravity, the character will take too long to fall. With too much, the\u00a0character struggles to go up slopes.</p>\n<p>*Is there anything else we should know?*</p>\n<p>Dash is needed to go up the first slope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The WebGl build does not display bullets VFX.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T14:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f7eb8c69871400e9dd2fe93a2ce185a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Zheng", "hemanthy", "Nikolas117", "Dragomaster78"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
