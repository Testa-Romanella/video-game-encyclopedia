I wanted to showcase it here because it is the very first game I \r\nbuilt with Unity and I have added some small touches that make it unique compared to the course version (like \"seizure mode\"). Unity makes it very easy to build for multiple platforms, so this game also has a mobile build in which the paddle follows the player's finger. <br/><br/></p><p>I've added download links for a desktop version and the android APK file. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12e6fb6041479fd7bd4f3e04f5938f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Spoka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
