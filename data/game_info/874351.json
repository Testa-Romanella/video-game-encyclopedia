Use your gunshots to knock yourself back and dart around the map to avoid projectiles, set up shooting angles, and even use the force of your fully charged knockback to kill enemies! See how much candy you can get before your gun is taken away!<br/><br/>This game was made by team <strong>PGD 91</strong> (consisting of 10+ people; mostly beginners) for a <strong>VFS game jam </strong>(hosted by <strong>Steve Kearney</strong>; solo dev of <strong>Relapse</strong>) from <em>the</em>\u00a0<em>17th to the 19th of\u00a0October, 2022</em>. Credits for the team are in the '<strong>Credits</strong>' menu (<em>check screenshots</em>)\u00a0&lt;3</p>\n\n<p>--- Alpha v0.42 ---</p>\n<p>This is the version we ended up submitting for the game jam. There are some minor bugs with the main menu UI, and a LOT of spaghetti code, but it works! The main known UI bug was the 'Quit' button not working after you go back to the menu from the game scene itself. Probably an easy fix, but have not had time to hop back in.</p>\n<p>Would love to keep working on this at some point in the future. We'll see :)</p>\n\n<p>(Partial) Inspiration:<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0oUARKw68<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T14:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03de12919dada4cbfaeecdea9f072e2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaltropis", "Embrace The Code"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
