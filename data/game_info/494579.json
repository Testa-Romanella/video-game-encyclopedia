The controls are fairly simple as there are only three possible inputs: <strong>Y for Yes</strong>, <strong>N for No</strong> and<strong> E for Enter</strong>. In order to progress through the game, the player (yes...you) must decide on which one of the two optional inputs (Yes/No) you want to press in order to choose a specific path to play through. There are multiple \"bad\" endings, but only one \"good\" ending.\u00a0However, there is a simple easter egg that I\u00a0had decided to implement for those that really want to explore this mess of a game. Have fun surviving!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da8e94cd23dd45cd269e99d24faf5f5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TokyoOniGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
