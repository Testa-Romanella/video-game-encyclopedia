From little things such as how getting more followers will get more donations, which in turn will help better the place as the player will be able to afford new plants, trees and more. We made sure that each resource depends on each other and will be useful in some way. There's also a lot of randomness in the game, no two playthroughs will ever be the same, which will help encourage replayability. We hope that this game will teach others that even the smallest action can bring about a huge and gradual impact on the environment.</p>\n<p>Your actions impact the world around you.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.
