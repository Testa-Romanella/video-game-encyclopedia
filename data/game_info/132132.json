One of the\u00a0games which I felt was furthest from being this on the Zeddy was\u00a0Asteroids, as the versions of it released at the time were largely\u00a0slow, unresponsive, and difficult to play (I mean, having your ship\u00a0displayed by the digits 1 to 8 depending on which direction it was\u00a0facing? Really?!)</p>\n<p>So, I decided to write Impact! as my interpretation of the game -\u00a0featuring smooth movement, fluid gameplay, player inertia (always loved\u00a0rotating, thrusting, and firing all at the same time), and graphics\u00a0which actually look something like the original arcade. It is\u00a0missing the\u00a0enemy saucers which appeared in the arcade version, but given the\u00a0smaller\u00a0playing field (the 64 * 46 effective pixels) I don't think that is a\u00a0huge loss as the game is frantic enough without them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong> - \"<em>The\u00a0enemy UFOs that occasionally drift across the play area have been left\u00a0out of Impact! [but] that ommision doesn't prove to be a major one in\u00a0the long run and the game is still fun</em>\" - 86%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/0760059c0eac26243d7c55a34082ec28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
