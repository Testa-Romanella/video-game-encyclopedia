Right now it's only available\u00a0as a digital game. The player draws cards and place them in a 3x3 board. At the end of a turn, only one card shall remain. Each of the four types has a condition to be removed\u00a0(e.g., the Shaman will be removed if there's a card on a diagonal).</p>\n<p>There's a detailed \"How to Play\" page in game. There are default game rules, but you can try other gamemodes and deck size, and it would be nice to receive feedback on how the game works best.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play it on browser or by downloading it on Windows. We are thinking about making a physical version when we have time.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for\u00a0PIGSquad Tabletop Jam 2021 by me and <em>le millhouse.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T09:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faff9781206885e464614d116162da02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["pedroMz"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
