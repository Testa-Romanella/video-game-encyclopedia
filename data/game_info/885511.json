A high res map of the gallery</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The\u00a0v1.2 update to ART-O-Ween adds additional dialogue as the main characters react to different costumes and also cleans up a few environments. There are still some pagination issues with some of the Art Info text. This is an eccentricity of the pulpmill process that is what it is for now, but I hope to address it more in the future.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This package includes the standalone game\u00a0<strong>ART-O-Ween\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>MAP-O-Ween</strong>, a high-res pdf and image of the grounds of the gallery, showing all the interconnections to help you navigate. Feel free to print it up (suggest at least 11\" x 17\") or scroll around it digitally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T10:08:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc71ba2514591f59bb7ab38b60fc61f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ledbetter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
