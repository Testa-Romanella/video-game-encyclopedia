It features a traditional verb-based interface, with updated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for'), unique collage-based art and ~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigans. <br/><br/>The preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is about an apparently primitive society, attempting to work together to build a space rocket. It follows these people, from disordered chaos (the past), through a disgusting and distorted and horrible and hilarious kind of faux-democracy (the present (SATIRE! Amirite?!?!)), into the unknowable, irrelevant emptiness of outer space (the future).<br/><br/>Along the journey players will encounter a host of colourful characters (including the mysterious Man with the Little Pencil, the superfluous Man in the Wren Suit and the fabulous Helen), they will solve a variety of engaging puzzles, and they will be forced into making a number of difficult moral decisions, with potential disastrous consequences!Features:<br/><ul><li>Traditional verb-based interface<br/></li><li>Updated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for')<br/></li><li>Unique collage-based art<br/></li><li>A cameo appearance from Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie) <br/></li><li>~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigans<br/></li><li>A joke about white blood cells<br/></li><li>Prohibitively experimental electronic music<br/></li><li>Irrelevant duck</li></ul>", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/84608d3667e98060fb13877cf1d1447a.jpg", "website": "http://www.tpaoe.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 65, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Richardson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joe Richardson"], "esrb_rating": null}
