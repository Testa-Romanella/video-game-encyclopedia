It is not 100% true though, simply inspired by what happened. To tell the whole truth would be a breach of privacy to a man who was very private in his life. But with him gone, my family and I are left to deal with what was left behind, all the things that he hid from us, and all the things we never got to experience with him because he's gone now.</p>\n<p>Please treasure the people in your life.</p>\n<p>See the help file in the game for a guide with hints and tips.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f7955eb0b59fcaaf0ae1d748ec272057.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skybeargames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
