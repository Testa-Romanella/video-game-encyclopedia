Please use the mouse <strong> scroll wheel </strong>~<br/>For other levels, there may be some small challenges, but they can all be overcome!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>No exquisite art, only real stories</strong></li></ul>Because I don't want to influence players from a very subjective perspective, I used a lot of blank space in art, and I am very satisfied with this art style!
