{"id": 238690, "slug": "harmonique-trial", "name": "Harmonique Trial", "name_original": "Harmonique Trial", "description": "<p>Harmonique Trial is an early concept developed in a short time for a class project, You control Pandy on a mini adventure to find the missing notes needed to play the tune that opens the gate to\u00a0Melody Meadows. You start the game with a single note and must complete the 4 puzzle/challenges to earn the remaining notes.</p>\n<p>Harmonique Trial is a passion project with the intention of creating a much larger 3D platformer which revolves around musical instruments and problem solving. It also features many references and throw backs to the classic 3D games of the N64 era. We have loads of ideas to expand the game and intend for each level to feature different instruments to help teach the basics of composing music and melodies.\u00a0</p>\r\nPlease remember to rate and share the game and leave a comment with your thoughts or feedback, would love to hear what you think!\r\nNote: The Mac and Linux builds are untested, please leave a comment if problems occur!\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W,A,S,D = Movement.</p>\n<p>Left Click = Play Current Note or Scroll Dialogue/ Text Boxes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Hold) Right Click = Note Selection (release on highlighted note to select it).</p>\n<p>Scroll Mouse Wheel = Zoom Camera In and Out.</p>\n<p>Esc. = Pause.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated by:\r\nPhasor (Tyla), Skatus12 (Karina)\r\n\r\nMusic by:\r\n<p>Main Menu, \"Magical Journey\" :\u00a0Kassich =\u00a0https://kassich.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>Credits, \"Inner Beauty\"\u00a0:\u00a0Kassich =\u00a0https://kassich.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>Main Theme, \"Wander into Wilderness\" :\u00a0Slaleky =\u00a0https://slaleky.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>Indoor Theme, \"A Homely Interior\" :\u00a0Alexander Emenheiser\u00a0=\u00a0https://ade-syndicate.newgrounds.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73e681b347646b7632ff8d015a37df9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phasor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
