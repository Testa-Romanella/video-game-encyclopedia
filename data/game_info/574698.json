It only had windshield wipers and gas working by the end.  I thought what if I had a whole week to do a game about windshield wipers?<br/></p><p>Drive a car. Use the windshield wipers. Get night-vision from aliens so you don't have to trap deer in the road using your headlights in dark cloudy weather.<br/></p><p>The game is essentially done. Needs more balancing. Not sure if it's beatable in it's current state without a ton of luck. Key problem is I'm not sure if the executable will run on anyone's computer buy mine. Wasted some time trying to figure that out. Definitely doesn't work on every computer.\u00a0Couple other issues and it all just managed to get away form me. When I was running out of time I chose to implement the rest of what I started and try to make sure there weren't bugs and that. What I cut out then was writing instructions and making the examine tool that lets you know what anything in the game is supposed to be. Maybe someone will try this and it'll actually work for them and they'll have a few minutes of fun wondering what's going on.
