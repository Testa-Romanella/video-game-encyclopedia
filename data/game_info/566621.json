A mysterious entity known as the  Nameless God serves as the main narrator of the story, having the  ability to peek in on the life of deceased souls and discover what  brought them to a premature death.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this  case, the Nameless God takes an interest in the fate of a witch named  Hazel.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCaptured, she wakes up in a prison somewhere in Aravorn.  She's  not alone though.  Locked in the cell next to her is an assassin named  Sasha who is as lethal as she is beautiful.  But can Hazel trust her  just because they're in a similar situation?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe  alternative is putting her faith in the paladin interrogating her.   While that option is far from ideal in it's own right, Hazel can't help  but feel a special connection to Tori.  Is it just in her head though?   Or can she really use that bond to escape?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe answer is no,  of course.  Hazel did end up in the Under-Realm one way or another.  But  is that all there is to her story?  Do all of her choices lead to  death?  Or does she have one final trick up her sleeve?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTales  Of The Under-Realm: Hazel features two love interests, Sasha and Tori.   Each of them have multiple endings that are based on the choices the  player makes during the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe events of this story take place in Aravorn during the year 700, after the Human  Empire has been split into regions and city-states due to civil unrest  and power-hungry wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Cast<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHazel - One of the last witches in Aravorn - at least, that's what the Council  of Grimoire thinks.  She's being held prisoner in the hopes that she'll  spill what she knows about the rest of them.  Now Hazel has to somehow  find a way to protect her fellow witches and herself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSasha - Hazel's chatty cellmate.  Though she seems to be an open book, she's  actually rather mysterious.  She hasn't had an easy life which is what  ultimately led to her becoming an assassin for hire.  Don't be deceived  by her appearance, she has more than earned that title.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTori - Once a Disciple of Truth, she left the temple on Mount Kronos to found  her own order of Templars.  Strong and determined, she is in charge of a  task force responsible for hunting down any witches left in Aravorn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T04:54:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a46dbcf3b6ad61899255fae6ac77042.jpg", "website": "https://www.winterwolves.com/tftu_hazel.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 452, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Winter Wolves"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Winter Wolves"], "esrb_rating": null}
