Capture them and use them against each other, but watch out each one has a puzzle in front of them and you must complete it in order to challenge\u00a0them. Earn trophies to show your progress and beat The Emperor to overcome the island.</p>\n<p>It is not done yet but it does show the main game play and every puzzle is beatable. The battle system doesn't work yet so just press Z to move past it. There will be some bugs so bear with it! Thank you for playing our game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Use mouse to press play and then use WASD to move around.
