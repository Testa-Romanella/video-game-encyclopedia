Move around and use your boosts to reach or avoid the projectiles, master the art of rebounds and trajectory for reaching your target.<br/><br/>With a variety of arenas and settings it is up to YOU to choose the kind of game that you'll play from 2 to 4 players. Create challenge according to your style, whether if its competitive or casual, thanks to our personalised settings!<br/><br/>Easy to play, hard to master<br/><strong>::CallBack</strong> can be learnt easily in a few moments and it can adapt to the player needs : you can choose to set up the target in the same stick as the movement command or you can have it on the second stick for a more technical approach.<br/><br/>Training is key for mastering the subtilities of <strong>::CallBack</strong> : whether its the rebounds, movement, dash management (boosts) or the terrain...even the specifics of each arena!<br/><br/><strong>Only perseverance will take you to glory in the Arena! </strong>Some of the actual characteristics in-game:<br/>Your support will help us to push the game even further!<br/>Our main ambition is to offer <strong>::CallBack</strong> and its intense local experience to reach as many people as possible worldwide.
