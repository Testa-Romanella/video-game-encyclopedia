{"id": 386331, "slug": "tribute-brie-beau-sheldon", "name": "Tribute (Brie Beau Sheldon)", "name_original": "Tribute (Brie Beau Sheldon)", "description": "<p>Tribute is a lonely game in which you explore love, loss, and permanence using a discarded or scavenged bone, found objects and artistry, and the daily weather\u2019s fickle oracle. A single player will start by focusing on a lingering loss of love (fictional or real) and create a tribute to that loss by decorating the bone.</p>\n<p>Please take care while playing Tribute, it can be emotionally straining. I recommend the Script Change toolbox for support, as well as reaching out to others and professional support. Grief is traumatic, do not belittle that, even for yourself.</p>\n<p>Tribute can take up to 15 days to play, but only for short periods each day. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is dedicated in memory of my grandmother, Mary Cousins, who I mourned before she died for reasons that I struggle to reconcile. She loved flowers, food, and family. This is my tribute.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06ac11d7cccad4e2754ccc1b29493cc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brie Beau Sheldon"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
