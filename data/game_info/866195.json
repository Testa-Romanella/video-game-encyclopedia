How will you choose to run the wealthy direct-democracy of politically neutral Switzerland? Will you be able to convert coal-loving Poland to an environmental paradise? Can you lift everyone out of poverty in the favelas of Brazil? And will your attempts at a secular society gain acceptance in Catholic Ireland? Can the republic of Ireland maintain a viable economy without a famously low rate of corporation tax?</p>\n<p>Have fun experimenting with whatever political ideology you choose to impose upon the people of these six new countries. Remember that this is Democracy, you need to take the people with you on your political destination, regardless of the destination!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T13:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/1757b74ff4381b868cff8250c3b7af5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cliffski"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
