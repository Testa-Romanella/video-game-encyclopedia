The original Fun School titles were sold mostly by mail order via off-the-page adverts in the magazines owned by Database Publications. A decision was made to create a new set of programs, call the range Fun School 2, and package them more professionally so they could be sold in computer stores around the UK. Every game comes as a set of three versions, each version set to cater for a specific age range.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Database Educational Software", "Database Publications", "Europress Software"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["Europress Software", "Database Educational Software", "Database Publications"], "esrb_rating": null}
