Previously being on the Caribbean, now he is coming to Panau - an island in Southeast Asia. This time, Rico has to overthrow the dictatorial regime with its leader, Pandak &quot;Baby&quot; Panay and confront his former mentor, Tom Sheldon. When Rico arrives at the island, he discovers three criminal gangs: The Roaches, The Reapers and the Ular Boys. In order to prevail, Rico has to fight all of the three fractions as well.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of the game is speed. This game is filled with adrenaline and ways of doing things very fastly. A wide variety of vehicles such as planes, boats, cars and other. A grappling hook is also available for the player as he can make his character fly around like Spider-Man or tie enemies to each other. There is a big choice of weaponry as well - you can have a pistol, two pistols, auto-rifles or even a grenade launcher! Having an open world map provides a player with experience do whatever they please - flying around, making missions or just discovering new things on the island.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2010-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a3c/a3c529a12c896c0ef02db5b4741de2ba.jpg", "website": "http://www.justcause.com/", "rating": 3.61, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 330, "owned": 6401, "beaten": 892, "toplay": 99, "dropped": 709, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 140, "ratings_count": 1316, "suggestions_count": 578, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1323, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "Avalanche Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
