It`s a game about movement, positioning, control and the lack thereof. Or maybe it`s just about flying around and shooting your friends, but that doesn`t sound as rad.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is at its best when played with four people, but is playable with as little as two. Playing with a gamepad is also highly recommended, though keyboard controls are supported (though they are a little uncomfortable).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you have any comments, complaints, general feedback, would like to see something fixed, or just want to say hi, feel free to get in touch with me via \r\n\ttwitter or email.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks a lot for taking the time to check out \r\n\t<em>sync</em>, or at the very least this page.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHope you like it!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>PATCH 1.0.1 NOTES:</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Ships now have 237% more trails!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Fixed some text display issues with the win messages\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Fixed a bug where players could create two explosions (which would break some other biz)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Thrusting is no longer \"totally broken\" in certian graphics settings\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* The Red ship can now use \"alt\" as well as \"ctrl\" to shoot\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Added support for a number of different controller / platform configurations\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Fixed controller connection / disconnection issues\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Added more names\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Added more win messages\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>THANK YOU:</strong>\n</p><p>\n<em>Jenny, Jason, Laura, Chris, Lauren, Henry, Damian, Taylor, Alex, Ryan, Randy and Troy (for GGJ14), </em><em>the Toronto game community, NOT Jim McGinley, and </em><em>everyone else who playtested / gave feedback. </em>\n</p><p>\n<em>Y'all rock.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e74bda213581d9e2a7be54fa8d6e2ad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jon Remedios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
