It's a rogue-like game I'm making during my free time in Unity. <br/>For the moment there's only one type of dungeon and one enemy. It's still a prototype, there's a lot of features and corrections do add so feel free to post some critic in a comment :)</p><p><strong>Progression: </strong>5%<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>Feel free to change the controls (I move using Q/D) cause I have a azerty keyboard.
