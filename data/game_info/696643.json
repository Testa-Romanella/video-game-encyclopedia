They asked not to share it or even speak of it. It is not known why they chose to do this. It has been speculated that the game reminds them of something they would like to forget.\r\n<p>This is a port I did, which is based on the Ver.0.030 build.<br/>It runs on, the official steam release of, the RPG MAKER 2003 Engine, (Version 1.12a).</p>\n<p>It works on newer machines, (With windows 7 and above), with some issues.<br/>(Certain events, that utilize files with unicode characters, will crash the game. This will take some time to fix as the \"source code\" is a mess of random, incoherent characters.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> I added the original release, bundled with EasyRPG player, until I manage to completely fix my port. The EasyRPG release has no issues, (other than some mild stuttering),\u00a0 and works as expected.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Q: Why is it called LcdDem \"Oniro\"?<ul><li>A: To differentiate it from the original version.</li></ul></li><li>Q: Why did you \"resurface\" this game?<ul><li>A: It is a very unique and interesting experience. It would be a shame to just let it die. But despite all said, I will remove the game if the original creator wants to.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d070a4835837d3086408936ec1450b7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guilvector"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
