I wanted to do something cute and detailed in pixel art but I didn't finish in time and never got to complete it later. There are still many Game Maker default props. Like the little strawberry instead of a proper player character which gave its name to the game. :'D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/835fa74b43bf9531fe6b7b41ac6c057f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LtEmi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
