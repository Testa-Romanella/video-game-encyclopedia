Graphically, this game is not up to par with other hits such as Mario Kart. Each of the different team cars have different color schemes. The courses also vary from blacktop to concrete, which lends to the feeling of driving in unique places like Toronto and Iceland. Rain is also included and is implemented in a realistic manner for the game's era.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014149c9e2aff9b23c26ceab2099d679.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["KID"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["HUDSON SOFT", "Naxat Soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
