Recommended two player, though if you're really talented I'm sure you could figure it out on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The web version is playable, but doesn't have controller support!\u00a0Do you want to huddle up to the keyboard right next to someone?\u00a0No?\u00a0Then download the exe (if you have Windows, if not..... sorry...)</p><p><strong>Controls are optimized for a gamepad</strong>, with one elf being controlled by the left joystick and the shoulder button, and the other elf being controlled by the RIGHT joystick and shoulder button. We recommend you play two player for the full experience!</p>\n<p>If you don't have a controller available, you can also play using the keyboard. Elf 1 uses WASD to move and holding down C to pickup items, Elf 2 uses IJKL to move and holding down N to pickup items. (Yes, those ARE their given names).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T02:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc492cda8b7436ff1f933060f67012d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Autumnotopia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
