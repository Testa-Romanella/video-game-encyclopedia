Online Game Jam 2020 with the given theme of Sadness.</p>\n<p>The main idea behind the game is you as the player finding yourself being alone in a small city district accompanied by you pet. You roam around the play area for possible clues as to why there is no one else around.</p>\n<p>The game is not a perfected and finished product. It is meant to test my limits of solo development during a limited amount of time available to me. I mainly pushed to see how well I could implement mechanics into the game and keep it playable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am fairly satisfied with how the game ended up being as I am mostly self taught. This being my first official Game Jam that I took part in for which I was able to actually contribute something towards, I am happy with the results! The time constraints did slightly kick in too early so the game is lacking in a lot of content that I had been planning for it.</p>\n<p>The game was created using Unity and all the Doodle Art was made with Pixilart (https://www.pixilart.com/).</p>\n<p>Music from:\u00a0Ultimate Game Music Collection (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/ultimate-game-music-collection-37351)</p>\n<p>Doodle Art, Writing and Code by xZidene</p>\n<p>Looking forward to future Game Jams and further improving my skills!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ff/7ff82efceed2fcc20916b9d651896852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xZidene"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
