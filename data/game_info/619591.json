A massive thanks to everyone at GMTK that has made this happen and we hope to join many more in the future.\u00a0</p><p>The project is in a relatively stable state and should be playable from start to finish but there may be an issue with the bullets shooting to fast for some users. Please let us know if you find any major bugs and we'll try our best to fix them post-jam.\u00a0</p><p>We've added downloadable builds for Windows, Linux and Mac.</p><p>If we had a little more time we would have loved to have made our own music and would have took a bit more time polishing up the level design and over all making the game look a little nicer. Big thanks to anyone that tries the game!</p>\n<p>Wez &amp; Tom - DoubleTom Games\r\n</p>\n<strong>Credits\r\n</strong>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/scifi-concentration</p><p>Font:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/kenney-fonts<br/></p><p>Game Engine:\u00a0https://unity.com\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Contact &amp; Links</strong>\n<p>Twitter\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Instagram\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Facebook\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>YouTube\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a6f21c8e565df49f9a3661541ee2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DoubleTom"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
