Bia was training drums with her brother's band in the garage. Tommy was playing classical music for his parents, very\u00a0grudgingly. Johanna laughed, as if there was no problem in this world to put her mind into. For a matter of seconds, that morning didn't come to be like the usual ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a reality above of human aknowledgement, chaos flourished. Energies danced with one another, looking for a balance that was now lost - when everything repelled, with the blast of an explosion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tiny shards of those energies solidified themselves and with the power and oddness of the impact, crossed their reality to collide with Yuki, Bia, Tommy and Johanna, allured by their moments of pure fragility. In the blink of an eye, the ambience around them was unfamiliar. Instruments in hands, these four humans with their music became the last hope of both worlds.</p>\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>The game counts only with the first tutorial level that takes 10-15' to complete, if you're acquainted to puzzle games!\u00a0</li><li>We're presenting 2 out of our beautifully made 4 characters that represent and include some minorities:<ul><li>Johanna, a nordic girl\u00a0who suffers from TDAH.\u00a0</li><li>Tommy, who suffers Neurosis and OCT.</li></ul></li><li>4 simple puzzles to challenge your mind through the tutorial.\u00a0</li><li>A glimpse of our story and worldbuilding specially made for Katharsis.\u00a0</li><li>All original music to carry your emotions through the gameplay.</li></ul>\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n<ul><li>We have some camera issues.
