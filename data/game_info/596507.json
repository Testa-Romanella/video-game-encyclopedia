{"id": 596507, "slug": "to-return-to-ones-root", "name": "To Return To One's Root", "name_original": "To Return To One's Root", "description": "<p>The game is called \"To Return To One's Root\" and the name of the game is an old Chinese proverb which may mean: a falling dead leaf falls on the roots of a tree; it is a metaphor for something that has a certain destination.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It is reminiscent of other ancient Chinese sayings.\" Falling red is not a heartless thing; it turns into spring mud and protects the flowers\", and \"the moistening of things is silent\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 It also means \"to nurture every spring life spontaneously and silently\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 Based on this, Combined with the theme of this contest, \"deeper and deeper\", We make a design with Chinese understanding and interpretation of \"The Life Extension\" and \"the reincarnation of the soul\". \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 The game was developed by two Chinese game enthusiasts\uff1aJiang Zheng and Xu Rongzhi. The overall style of the graphics is a blend of Chinese National Painting, Chinese Ink Painting, and Modern Chinese Cartoons. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 The game is about a falling leaf that is about to end its life, falling from the tree into the soil, its life energy nourishing everything. We manipulate this energy to keep looking for new animal life to give it the energy to continue down the road, to awaken its consciousness that was once human, and to reincarnate again.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 We share our feelings\uff1aThe opening music has an \"oriental rhythm\" and we tried to restore the feeling of \"life fading away\", but it is not sad.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 The music is rather long, about 30 seconds, so if you are interested, you can listen to it before you start the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>From the beginning of the falling leaves to the flow of life forms to other animals. What we think is that this is energy, the same energy of everything in the universe never stops, it just keeps shifting. And why does it keep going down? This is because of the Chinese saying \" Gui Men Guan \". It means a \"door of reincarnation\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 It is the beginning of the cycle of life, a place somewhat similar to \"hell\", except that it does not represent the end. Only a person can step into the \" Gui Men Guan \".\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 Maybe this leaf and all the creatures in it were human beings in their past lives? They all want to pass through layers of difficulties and gain life energy until they are reincarnated as human beings again. And in this process, they are just surviving, only to reach the \"door of death\" and suddenly remember that they were once human.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 We would have liked to join the Chinese game of beast-fighting Chess, but unfortunately, time is running out to join the natural enemies of various animals and the chase. And a series of falling leaves drifting down, the decaying sense of falling leaves with a cinematic dribbling mirror could not be done. We also want to continue to do the part of the reincarnation of life after the \"Gui Men Guan\". We are very sorry! This is also our regret.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p>Update 2021-4-27 11:43:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.\u00a0Fix\u00a0infinite movement points issue\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.
