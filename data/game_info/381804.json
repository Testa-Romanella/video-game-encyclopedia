One pocket is added for every shot taken where no ball is potted. If at least one ball (besides the cue ball) is potted in a shot, then the number of pockets remains the same and a new random set of pockets is selected.</p>\n<p>If the cue ball is potted during a shot, one additional pocket is added to the table. If the cue ball touches no other ball during a shot, one additional pocket is added to the table. If the cue ball and any other ball is potted in the same shot, then one additional pocket is added for every other ball potted.</p>\n<p>Aim your shot by left clicking and dragging anywhere on the screen. Take the shot by letting go of the left mouse button. The power is determined by the length of the drag, whilst the shot angle is determined by the angle of the drag. Aiming can be inverted in the settings menu or from the pause screen.</p>\n<p>The line coming from the ball shows the angle of the shot and the first object it will hit or where it will stop. Shot power is shown as a percentage in the bottom left. A line will also be drawn from the first ball you will hit, showing where it will go after being hit.</p>\n<p>Shots can be cancelled by dragging back to where the shot was started or by right clicking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:35:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eefcb14fc6b6c1bd225f847b0d4c522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ellis Spice"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
