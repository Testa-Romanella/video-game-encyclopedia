If you know your keyboard perfectly, you can try to stick to this jam's theme and play the game with a single hand..that's pretty hard, tho, but if you learn your keyboard this way, you can pet your dog with one hand and type with the other (it doesn't work with cats....yet).</p>\n<p>This was made for the Game Makers Tool Kit 2019 Game Jam, which theme was \"only one\". My idea of only one in this game is that only one key on your keyboard will make you get more points.\u00a0 In the future I will fix issues like difficulty, position of elements, presentation and more, since my idea is to take this mechanic to a full project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:35:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3ec2279f98eeafa36682f06ff537cef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dinamic Creates"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
