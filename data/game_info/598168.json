It's a\u00a0\u00a0project I've been working on since 2015, and is my take on the classic Eastern-Style RPG games, where a group gets together to ultimately save the world.</p>\n<p>Currently, this build is only a (lengthy) demo, equating to ~1/3 of the full game with a playtime of approximately 10-18 hours depending on your playstyle and optional content completed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Untold Story follows the story of Rover Wilson, a student learning how to use the Elements at Chilriva School. After discovering a stone structure deep in an ancient shrine, Rover and his friends encounter a group meddling with what they called a \"Monument\". After Rover and his friends are mysteriously teleported away from their home, Rover meets a new band of friends who save his life.\r\n</p>\n<p>What begins as a simple quest to find his lost friends, develops into a mission to save the world--by destroying the only things keeping it together. Along the way Rover meets people who have their own stories to tell, and learns more about the world than he ever knew.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Untold Story is a turn-based RPG, where each of your party members take their action before the enemies get their turn to retaliate. The Demo Version contains 6 main playable characters, each with their own playstyle to aid you in battle. Each of these characters is unique and has their own role to play in battles, so switching between them is vital to success.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gameplay features two main settings: exploring the map, and exploring dungeons.\r\n</p>\n<p>On the map, chatting with people around the world is a huge aspect. I aim to make NPCs feel real, to feel like real people living in this fantasy world. Every single NPC is unique and has their own story going on, it is up to you if you wish to learn about them.\r\n</p>\n<p>In dungeons, you traverse the map while battling through Monsters that roam around freely.\u00a0Treasure Chests make dungeons their home, and are filled with goodies awaiting their arrival in your pockets. Defeating Monsters will grant Experience Points and allow your characters to level up.\r\n</p>\n<p>In most instances, the Demo Version follows the full version, but some changes have been made to improve the experience for the shorter game time:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>2 \"Super Bosses\" have been added to the Demo, not found in the full version.\r\n</li><li>Some Weapons and Quests are found in the Demo that do not appear until later on in the full version.\r\n</li><li>Most instances of events that only take effect later on in the full version have been removed, though there are some cases where this is not the case.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Randomized Mode:</strong></p>\n<p>The Demo\u00a0Version contains a built-in randomizer mode, which will shuffle the contents of every single treasure chest in the world. There is also a Party Shuffle that randomizes the order at which party members join.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This mode will likely be removed in the next major update, but may return in the full release</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Untold Story: Demo Version's default control is the Keyboard.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Arrow Keys are used to control character movement.\r\n</li><li>\"Z\" and \"X\" are primary buttons, doing most actions from interacting with the environment to opening the menu to canceling out of options.\r\n</li><li>\"Shift\" is used to dash while on the map, and can be used to swiftly skip past text when held down.\r\n</li><li>\"Q\" and \"W\" are used to quick swap between party members in menus, and quickly scroll up and down while in menus.\r\n</li><li>The Function [\"Fn\"] key can be used in conjunction with the \"F5\" and \"F6\" keys to increase the game window size, and offer full screen support.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Untold Story: Demo Version was made using RPG Maker VX Ace.
