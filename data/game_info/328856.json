{"id": 328856, "slug": "legend-of-the-otaku", "name": "Legend of the Otaku", "name_original": "Legend of the Otaku", "description": "<p>Legend of the Otaku is an anime-based role-playing game where you step into the shoes of Tenchi Takahashi, a hardcore anime addict, manga aficionado, and overall otaku-extraordinaire. Tenchi's life of fandom is abruptly interrupted by the sudden appearance of Anju, a mysterious girl from another dimension (aren't they always?). A vicious demonic overlord is conquering Anju's homeland, so her inventor-father sent her through a transdimensional portal with a set of powerful crystals, which are capable of tapping into the substantial energy existing at the crossroads of worlds. The crystals amplify the user's inner strength, turning Tenchi and his friends into the heroes that they always dreamed of being.</p>\n<p>This game is a melting pot of every anime genre that has ever existed. Ever want to see futuristic mecha piloted by a magical girl take on a kaiju bound to a monster-trainer's summoning ball, while engaging in a food war with all of the waifus from your favorite harem show? Me too. As a huge anime fan, I designed Legend of the Otaku to give something back to anime fans everywhere. The story unfolds in a rich immersive environment, so feel free to explore, push buttons, open boxes, and discover all of its inside jokes, easter eggs, and other secrets.</p>\n<p>The game is available for download free of charge.
