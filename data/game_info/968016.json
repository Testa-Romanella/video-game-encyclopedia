It's tough, and only gets tougher, but it's also designed so that even inexperienced platforming gamers can pick it up. But for those true sadists and god-gamers among us, there is an even more brutal challenge in the form of time trials.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMake use of momentum, jumps, air dashes, ground boosts, jump-orbs, and a multitude of movement techniques to overcome the game's 8 levels. Checkpoints are frequent, but hazards even more so. Spikes and giant saws will block your path, but if you are dexterous, you can weave through them in no time! Do you have what it takes to overcome the world of Kaizo Block?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T05:35:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/817b596a168a394dc93b22f2f6c673dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Liam Nicholl"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Good Times Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
