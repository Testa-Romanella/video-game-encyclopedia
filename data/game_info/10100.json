This is <strong>Moving Hazard</strong>: a team-based, PvPvE competitive first person shooter from Psyop Games and IllFonic, using Unreal Engine 4.<br/><br/>After the collapse of civilization due to a fast-moving and unstoppable zombie plague, what remains of humanity has retreated to a handful of fortified military bases and left everything in between to the shambling corpses of the zombie majority. In order to survive, your squad must venture out into the wasteland and face off with other survivors for control of important resources and strategic command points.<br/><br/>In<strong> Moving Hazard</strong>, zombies are not simply an enemy to be sought out and exterminated; they are a dynamic part of the battleground which you must navigate, manipulate, and ultimately weaponize in order to defeat your human foes. In addition to having a selection of military-grade assault weapons at their disposal, players will also need to take advantage of technology specifically evolved to allow them to control the zombies that they encounter by attracting, repelling, sedating, angering, or booby-trapping them, as well as a wide variety of additional tactics.<br/><br/><strong>Moving Hazard</strong> features realistic weapons and a military approach to using tactical equipment and skillstreaks to weaponize and herd zombies to the player\u2019s liking in order to gain the upper hand. On top of classic frags, smoke grenades, and claymores, equipment at your disposal in Moving Hazard includes the Pheromone Attractor Molotov (aka The PAM), which make any infected hit become frenzied and hunt down enemies for a short period of time. The Chaos Grenade will stun your enemies while frenzying close by zombies, making for some interesting zombie kills. The Templar will broadcast a unique signal that zombies truly despise, turning them in their tracks to head away from it as fast as possible. These items and more (turrets, infected ammo, distractors, and onward) will allow your team to greatly shift the flow of each map and present tactical options not found in any other squad-based shooter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/380995c99179154e215a69690653e7cf.jpg", "website": "http://www.movinghazard.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 42}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 44, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 676, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IllFonic", "Psyop Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Psyop Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
