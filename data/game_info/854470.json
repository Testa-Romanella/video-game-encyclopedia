Buy upgrades from killing enemies to kill... even more enemies! These creatures can be anywhere from speedy and aggressive to shy and slow. It is set in a microscopic world, and the player and enemies resemble real microorganisms. Control the player by using your mouse and clicks, but do expect controls for other abilities and movement. This movement is smooth and satisfying, and effects like shaking and particles add on to it. You can buy upgrades for your character in a shop to get increased stats or whole new gameplay mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore updates will be coming in the future!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T06:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d491084afae1974208bd393fbcdc0222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Haniotis"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Alex Haniotis"], "esrb_rating": null}
