The game has been discontinued outside of Japan and China, and is difficult to access, and cannot be easily played in English anymore.</p>\n<p>This project is designed to allow you to replay the story cutscenes from the game, using data from the GGZ cutscene interpreter project, but presented in a visual novel format. Backgrounds and music from other parts of the game have also been added to some of this recreated story content to enhance the presentation.</p>\n<p>All of the content, artwork, music, and media presented in this not-for-profit fan work is the exclusive property of MiHoYo/HoYoverse and COGNOSPHERE.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype. Only a few chapters are included to show off the engine and put it through its paces. Feel free to provide feedback or ask questions. Should work on any device with a modern browser, including mobiles. Chrome or Safari is recommended for smoother animations.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the Hoyostans community, including Mister Spaceman, Demonbanex, Bun Bun, Max, Darkmiz, and others for their work on the re-translation.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T14:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb6e684249289d0c9d5b84541a43ea89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chapel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
