I had quite a few ideas but ended up taking a simpler one and simply doing a follow up to my earlier Space Maze game. Space Maze 2 is a simple  platformer with only one level and a few items.\u00a0There is no background music or sound effects partially due to me working solo and assets having to be created during the jam period.  I did have a quick crack at sfx though didn't produce anything that made it into the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Search for the four batteries to restore power to the elevator while collecting the terrariums for oxygen.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>Movement - Arrow keys<br/>Interact - C<br/>Jump - X</p>\n<p>Walk/Run select - Shift</p>\n<p>View scale - Enter + Up arrow<br/>Random pallete - Enter + Right arrow<br/>Disable pallete shader - Enter + Left arrow</p>\n<p>Close game - Esc</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/>Engine: GameMaker: Studio 1.4<br/>Font: Pixeltype by TheJman0205<br/>Palette Shader: E Breakey<br/>Palettes: lospec.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb120e40541788b10094c8aaf7b29970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dabski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
