Gather Passives that will make your runs stronger, and die with them to turn them into Memories - weaker variants of the Passives that last forever, and stack infinitely! Not only that, every time you beat the final boss, all enemies are made harder in their own unique ways! <strong>There is even a [secret boss] that becomes available after beating the game once!</strong>(Please fight them I put too much effort into them)<br/></p>\n<p>I expect this to probably have some bugs as I literally decided I've \"finished\" this game RIGHT NOW right before I'm uploading it. <em>That's</em> how close I'm cutting it short of the deadline date. The fact that I managed to get this \"complete\" in time is a miracle in of itself. <br/></p>\n<p>As a result, I had to skip out on a few things, the biggest thing being that all of the expanded-enemy sprites were not complete. For the most part, everything else <em>should</em> be fine, and I <em>DO</em> intend on coming back to this after the Jam is fully over to touch up some things and finish the spritework.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hope you all enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T05:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887be6e92be47a06d543121bca4b5872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SomeoneInflative"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
