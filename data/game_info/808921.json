All jokes aside I really did enjoy making this, and honestly I learned more in the past 2 days than I ever had in school or working on any other project. I just wish I knew how painful it would be trying to make my first 3D game during a 3 day game jam. Despite the game saying it's released, it isn't really close to being done as I had no time to finish. Level 2 and 3 aren't able to be played, because if I made them I would've had to submit this project 2 days over the deadline. Anyways hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T05:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b5d65db6a32d5fa2e7091594917828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tri Saurus"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
