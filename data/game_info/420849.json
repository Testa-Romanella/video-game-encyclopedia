Horror Survival.</p><p>EARLY RELEASE - more content coming soon!\u00a0</p>\n<p>OCULUS QUEST DOWNLOAD:\u00a0https://sdq.st/a-631</p>\n<p>OCULUS RIFT: Download below\u00a0\u00a0(Oculus Store In Review)</p>\n<p>DeadScope will be the Exorcist of Virtual Reality Games. [Currently only Oculus is supported.]</p>\n<p>Currently in Early Release, we are building DeadScope from the ground up, specifically for VR platforms. No gimmicks, just a solid Horror/Adventure game unique to the Virtual Reality experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sight is a powerful mechanic in DeadScope. Equipped with your \"DeadScope\", a periscope like device in your hands, you can peek over and around objects to see your environment and the surrounding Demons. Conceal yourself in tall grass and brush, and move undetected like a submarine in the water. This mechanic only works in a VR environment; grab your DeadScope off your chest and literally bring the optical to your face (just like you would use binoculars in real life).</p>\n<p>Stealth is your friend in DeadScope! Teleporting long distances will generate more sound. You must choose your path carefully, understand your surroundings, and stay out of sight. Demon intelligence is based on sight, sound, and soon smell (in development). Find objects like cans and books and throw to distract the Demons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The enemies in DeadScope are unique to VR. Avoid the Giant Demon; a 30ft monster patrolling the landscape and don't get squashed. Avoid making eye contact with the Breather, an overweight Demon who will shoot out an extended arm and pull you in. Avoid swamp creatures who patrol the land, and who will chase you down. Elude the dark silhouettes hiding in the grass, their screams will draw much attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are still in the super Early Development phase. Here are the features we will soon add. The storyline, Flashlight, Crowbar, Weapons, More Enemies, Smart Artificial Intelligence, Random Generated Level Mode, and more Levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c955e83494210ec4d135805794a786a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ME GAMES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
