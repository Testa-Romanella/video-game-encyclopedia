{"id": 216083, "slug": "orbfocus", "name": "OrbFocus", "name_original": "OrbFocus", "description": "<p>This game is a simple 3D platformer with first person perspective and some shooting. It's unique because you are unable to look around or aim freely. Instead your character is always focused on an orb and the goal of the game is to reach all of the orbs in sequence. You are also unable to jump and have to fight some enemies. Getting through some parts can be very tricky.</p>\n<p>Game is in simple Unity executable file for Windows and intended to be played with keyboard only. All of the design (mechanics and level) and scripting has been done by me. I used some simple free assets from Unity Asset Store (textures, sounds, particles). They are all listed (with authors as appearing in the store) in readme.txt file inside the game folder.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6bd63837f22c508c69ac5cff9e72001.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bonythias"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
