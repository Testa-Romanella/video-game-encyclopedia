You have been tasked with destroying the scourge that has destroyed this city: a tree. Do not be deceived by appearances, this tree will not hesitate to end you. Fortunately, this beast has an exploitable weakness: its roots. Players will stomp on roots as they appear, slowing the corruption of the tree. Players may choose to work separately, but some roots will take both of you to overcome; it will be well worth it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:37:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47d/47dbc66c17174e1f351b8b11334a56f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Neji Yuri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
