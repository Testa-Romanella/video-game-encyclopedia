It\u2019s my tribute to Rod Humble, if you must.\r\n<p>This is a Flash game I made in 2009. At the time, I thought this game was about procrastination. Now I realize it's about living and working with severe depression, anxiety, untreated trauma, and maybe undiagnosed ADHD. It's not pleasant to play and it wasn't pleasant to make.</p>\n<p><strong>If you donate at least $5, you can download full source code and resources for the game.
