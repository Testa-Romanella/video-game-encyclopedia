{"id": 350032, "slug": "ostrofa", "name": "Ostrofa", "name_original": "Ostrofa", "description": "You find yourself stranded on a deserted island, surrounded with nothing but wild animals and collectible resources. What do you do?<br/><br/>Welcome to Ostrofa, where you\u2019ll be challenged to use your survival instincts and combat skills to survive in a randomly generated, low-poly environment, fighting other players around the world!<h3>Collect resources to stay alive</h3><br/><br/><br/>Food can be found on your or surrounding islands. Look for apple and orange trees, mushrooms, vegetables, and berries. You can also hunt nearby animals, which can provide a good amount of meat.<h3>Explore your surroundings</h3><br/><br/><br/>Stay away from the dark - there are a lot of wild creatures watching you. Carry a torch or build a campfire to keep yourself warm and scare them away. A sharp axe or gun might come in handy.<h3>Find valuable gear</h3><br/><br/><br/>The best way to survive and kill other players is to get the best gear in the game. Chests are scattered all over the map and contain very, very exciting and worthy items. Be as quick as you can to loot them first!<h3>Protect your island</h3><br/><br/><br/>You'll notice a bright, glowing orb on top of the statue right next to your spawn position - it represents your external heart. Once this structure gets destroyed by another player or NPC, you won't be able to respawn if you get killed and, unfortunately, the game will end for you. Make sure to protect it as best as you can!<br/><br/><h3>Crafting</h3><br/><br/><br/>What will you need to fend off aggressors of your territory? Weapons, Traps, and Tools! The blueprint panel next to your inventory grants you the power to craft and will be one of the most essential skills you'll need to survive in Ostrofa!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9aabcbbcfbfd3e8698857ca53971499.jpg", "website": "https://www.ostrofa.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Normunds Petrovs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Normunds Petrovs"], "esrb_rating": null}
