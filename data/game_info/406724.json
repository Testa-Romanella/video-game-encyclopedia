All objects within the room where created by myself, with some images sourced from online and materials manipulated through Photoshop. For an extracurricular activity, I then took this room and turned in into a VR experience using Unity, allowing people to see the room as if they are actually there.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is an experience and not interactable in its current stage.</p>\n<p>*I do not take credit for sketches used in the room. These were created by various artists found online. Except the hobbit on the desk. That one's mine.</p>\n<p>*This project was made for educational purposes only. It will not be used for commercial purposes in any way.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/37153ca399ec06954348c57277829293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rebecca Kerr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
