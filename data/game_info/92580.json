{"id": 92580, "slug": "nova-swarm", "name": "Nova Swarm", "name_original": "Nova Swarm", "description": "<p>Nova Swarm is a 1v4 local multiplayer VR space battle game. A maniacal AI ship (the VR player) with a powerful laser, rechargeable shield, and undying hatred of the human race faces off against an armada of humans (up to four players with standard XBox or similar controllers) piloting fragile but agile ships capable of using a variety of weapon and tactical item configurations. Not only that, but the ships are invisible when they\u2019re not shooting. Grab four friends, or just face off against some CPU players. Either way, there will be tons of explosions.<br/></p>\r\nVR needs more local multiplayer games.\u00a0\r\n<p>Playing a single-player game in VR can often feel isolating. Even when others are watching, you\u2019re stuck in a headset where you can\u2019t see anyone around you. Also, those others may feel left out, especially after the novelty of VR has worn off. VR is such an amazing experience, and it should be fun not only for the person in VR, but for everyone else too. Local multiplayer in the usual symmetrical sense is currently difficult to achieve in VR, but there are a lot of possibilities for asymmetric gameplay. With games like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and Panoptic\u00a0(which is currently a demo), it\u2019s clear that there are ways to make VR feel inclusive and fun for both the player in VR and those outside of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Nova Swarm</strong> pits a deadly goliath of a ship (the VR player) against an armada of little ships (up to four players with standard XBox or similar controllers).</p>\r\nOnline Play...\r\n<p>...isn't in this game. YET. Creating a local multiplayer experience was my primary goal, but I sympathize with both the fact that VR is expensive and gathering friends can be like herding space-cats. There's no set timeline, but I'm currently looking into networking solutions, and would like to get VR players playing with non-VR players over the internet. Updates to come!</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\nWant to support this game?\r\n<p>If you like what you see and want me to keep making stuff like this, you can donate a bit o' green when you download the game (thanks!)<br/>Alternatively, you can become a supporter of my work via\u00a0Patreon!</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\r\nThis game is in Alpha!\r\n<p>That means there's a good chance things will be broken, weird, or even just plain not fun (though I hope that's not the case!) I'll be continuing to improve on things over time, so it will also go through a lot of changes.</p>\r\nWant to give some feedback?\r\n<p>Awesome! I love feedback!
