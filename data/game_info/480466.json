The idea was to do something simple yet enjoyable, so Bomberman was the obvious choice. The aim of this game is simplified in comparison to the original, you don't have to kill all the enemies to complete the level. You just need to get to the exit. The level is randomly generated.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD or arrows for movement<br/>Space to place the bomb</p>\n<p>Feedback is highly appreciated</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:34:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d529415cdfd0880f0fdd9e9bb257f71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meslex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
