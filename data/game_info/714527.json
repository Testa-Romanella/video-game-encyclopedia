Here, as in reality, there is nothing fun.  Your only activity is walking.  You will slowly walk from side to side and explore this completely ordinary, but still amazing place in its own way.  An authentic Russian apartment with wool carpets, an uncomfortable bed and an old TV is waiting for you. After getting out of the apartment, you will find yourself in a classic Russian courtyard, with a destroyed playground, rusty garages and crooked fences. I wish you a pleasant time!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T03:26:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/0791010d28d2dce731eac5cba52917d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flex Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flex Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
