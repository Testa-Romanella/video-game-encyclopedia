Hence, the creation of \"Big Guns\"</p>\n<p>\"Big Guns\" is a 2D\u00a0action platformer with heavy inspiration from classics such as Super Meat Boy and Contra\u00a0(Probotector). The game has a kinetic pace and tough-as-nails platforming sections akin to those of the classics from the early 90s.</p>\n<p>To fit the \"One Action\"\u00a0theme of the game jam, I inhibited the capabilities of the main character to the point where he could only aim and shoot. The gun he wields is powerful, yet too heavy to allow him to move and platform like in other 2D\u00a0action games from the era. Hence; he may only propel himself forward using the recoil of his Bolt Rifle.</p>\n<p>Use the gun's rapid automatic fire to propel your character through one action-packed level. Shoot, move, and fly with enough finesse to make it through increasingly tightly packed rooms and corridors filled with collectible \"Fragments\" and \"Lazer\u00a0Traps\".</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>Please leave any critiques and comments on this page and I will try my hardest to respond to all of them as quickly as I can.\u00a0I hope you enjoy my little game, and hopefully you guys will want to see more! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:44:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/444b6c239d1f54eb35ed72e5830c0e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroDEV"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
