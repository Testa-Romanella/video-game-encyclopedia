That mean that Your task is not to throw the ring into the Mount of Destiny, or to defeat the Death Star, but to.. purchase potatoes on the market in small Masovian (Poland) city of Garwolin . Sounds nice ? This is for starters, because then there are trolls and ... the rubber-manga-rabbit.</p>\n<p>All this in the company of two nice brothers. Guide their fate in a fun point and click adventure.<br />\nThe game offers 4 different endings . Although some of them are not very pleasant ;-) So watch the player for what you do.</p>\n<p>Main game features:</p>\n<pre><code>full 3d environment  \nfull polish dubbing and English translation  \n4 different possibilities to end the game  \nfunny dialogs and quests  \n5 steam achievements to conquer\n</code></pre>\n<p>History:<br />\nMazowiecka Adventure is a full indie (independent) game! It was created because my son wanted to be a hero in a computer game. As I have two sons, I created a game about them. Well, more or less about them, because we don&#39;t have a troll&#39;s in our neighborhood ;-)<br />\nAt the beginning, the game was quite raw, as it was a hobby game, but over time, after we put lot of work on the mechanics, levels, history, graphics and recorded dialogues (which by the way was quite fun), it turned out that a neat and playable story was created.<br />\nSo I decided, a bit convinced by the opinions of friends, to show my work to the world. At this point, the stairs began, because it took me almost as much time to create the game, to test it, detect and correct errors and adapt the product to market standards. Anyway, it worked :)</p>\n<p>I invite you to play. I think it&#39;s worth it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T15:02:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2e5291ef3d9f4a345b93e3ce2d8cf6.jpg", "website": "http://rysiojasio.eu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XQG Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["XQG Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
