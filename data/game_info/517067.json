This game has been lost to time and completely scrubbed from the internet since 2015 when I uploaded the game to greenlight with intentions of releasing a full version. The game was greenlit in 2015.\u00a0https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379716534</p>\n<p>Recently I've came in contact with an old friend and moderator of my live stream back then. I\u00a0asked if he happened to have an old hard drive or computer we could look through to search for the game. He did, and we found the game! It's a terrible game and I'm completely embarrassed by it, but holy fuck it feels good to have it back.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE!</p>\n<p>There is a new bug that didn't exist in the original release back in 2014, the mouse cursor won't show on the main menu. If you hit escape or start on controller it'll bring up the menu, you can then put your cursor over the start button and start the game.</p>\n<p>There's also a bug with launching these old unity exe's where it takes a lot of cpu power. I'm not sure what that is or why it does that, but it takes a long time to launch. It was doing it on my computer anyways. Keep a task manager open just to be safe I\u00a0guess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T05:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f5ca5dcdd17d2366b142816e285892c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndieCritic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
