It brings the player back to a gritty futuristic world in which conflicts are waged between five world powers: the U.S.N., O.C.U., E.C., O.A.C., and the Republic of Zaftra. Such conflicts are waged with the wanzer, Front Mission-speak for mecha.<br />\nGameplay-wise, the game is a true return to Front Mission 2 roots while incorporating various features from Front Mission 1, 3, and 4. The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots.<br />\nUnlike the previous games which were fairly standalone, Front Mission 5 covers the time period from 2070 to 2121. In effect, it goes through conflicts seen in the previous games as the years pass by. Through the eyes of U.S.N. soldier/officer Walter Feng, the player experiences his story as he deals with the aforementioned conflicts. With the passing of time, he becomes witness to hidden truths and accounts. Eventually, Feng is drawn to the on-going war on terrorism and begins to search for the truth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T09:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d32/d322f56df6557063acfc1c6eb5ae6ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 486, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Square Enix"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
