Collect the rings to instantly increase your score/runes by 100. Collect the armor to protect you from being damaged by bats or wolves for once. Visually, you will see the armor icon on the top left corner and the colour of the knights' armor changes to gray while you are equipped with armor.\u00a0 At the same time, make sure the knight isn't stopped by any obstacles, since once the chasing golem catches you, it will destroy you no matter what!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredit list:\r\n<p>- Sprites:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.
