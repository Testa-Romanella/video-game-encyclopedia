Reality is broken and distorted, wth the division between spiritual and material compltely gone. Belief and willpower is the most important asset for any who might want to do more than merely exist.</p>\n<p>Mechanics: This prototype is all about testing ideas to make an RPG that I've always wanted to play, but never found. So I decided to make it myself! Combat works on bars, separating regular old run-of-the-mill attacks from skills that cost resources. Combat is to be be heavily focused on different ways of optimization, from controling who is taking damage, to various skills that have their value or cost dependent on timing and various circumstances. Hopefully it's also somewhat fun!</p><p>Need feedback on pretty much all aspects of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/6999f326278c276f30223f2406fc5999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WoodGargoyle"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
