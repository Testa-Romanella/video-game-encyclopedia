This prototype took roughly 140 hours of development time between Oct 2020 to Feb 2021.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had a fun time working on this concept\u00a0and enjoyed learning about all the various tools and features that UE4 provides. I feel much more\u00a0comfortable developing in C++ now and I am looking forward to using my skills towards\u00a0my next projects.<br/></p>\n<p>Many thanks to the following content creators:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Looman</strong></p>\n<p>For providing amazing learning material that dives right into Unreal Engine C++ programming. Tom's \"<strong><em>Unreal Engine 4 Mastery: Create Multiplayer Games with C++</em></strong>\"\u00a0course on Udemy really helped me get familiar with using C++ in order to create modular and powerful game components. Check out his Udemy course and website if you are interesting in learning more about UE4 from a master!

[\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/train-yard\u00a0]\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mixamo</strong></p>\n<p>For providing a great selection of character models and animations for newcomers starting out on their prototype projects such as this one. I built the SWAT character and Zombie enemies using the meshes and animations they provided.
