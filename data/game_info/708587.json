{"id": 708587, "slug": "the-legend-of-santa-jbringle", "name": "The Legend of Santa (jbringle)", "name_original": "The Legend of Santa (jbringle)", "description": "<p>Christmas is just a few days away... and while Santa is out on a trial run in his sleigh, the evil South Pole Troll and his army of Penguins invade the North Pole!   </p>\n<p>On the way back to his workshop, Santa is blasted out of the sky by one of his very own North Pole defense cannons and is sent spiralling far-off into the distance.   </p>\n<p>Now Santa must find his way back home, defeat the Troll, and save Christmas!   </p>\n<p>*The current demo contains one level and shows a small picture of what we hope is to come. In the full game, we plan to have multiple worlds, each with several levels and branching paths, along with many enemies, traps, and power-ups.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>\n<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong> </p>\n<p>The Legend of Santa can be played using a controller, the keyboard, or touch controls, but we do recommend using an official Xbox controller. Although any controller using XInput should work, we can't guarantee the button mapping for non-official controllers will always be correct. There isn't yet an in-game button mapping screen, so please consider using another software, like JoyToKey (https://joytokey.net/en/), to map your controller's buttons to the keyboard assignments below if your controller isn't compatible.   </p>\n<p><strong>Move and Duck:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Dpad or Left Stick  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: WASD or Arrow Keys  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jump (hold for higher jumps):</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: A or B  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: Spacebar or Z  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Run (hold) and Use Power-up:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: X or Y  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: X or Shift  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Pause:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Start  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: 1  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Confirm:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: A  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: Spacebar or Z  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cancel:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: B  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Keyboard: X or Shift</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>COLLECTIBLES IN DEMO</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Cookie:</strong> Collect 100 for an extra life.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li><strong>Hat:</strong> An extra life.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li><strong>Outfit:</strong> Fills health.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li><strong>Stocking Full of Coal:</strong> Power-up with coal \tthat can be thrown at enemies.  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>\n<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>1-4 players  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Controller, keyboard, and on-screen control options  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Classic 256x224 and widescreen 384x224 in-game resolutions  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Pixel-perfect, crisp and blurred display options  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>*Level design and difficulty is based on single-player, using a controller, and a 256x224 in-game resolution.   </p>\n<p><strong>Streamlined, intuitive multiplayer</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Up to four players simultaneously.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>No bumping into or bouncing off other players.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Respawn when you're ready by simply pressing jump.  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Simple, tight, responsive controls</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Snappy acceleration, turn-arounds and jumping.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>No jumping from walls or slow falling next to walls.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>No slight dipping and pressing jump always jumps when running \tover single, tile-wide gaps.  \t\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Non-stop action</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>No screen freezes when collecting power-ups or getting hit.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>No screen freezes when dying, especially in multiplayer.  \t\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>No input accidents due to screen freezes.\r\n \r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Download and unzip \u201cThe Legend of Santa Demo.zip\u201d\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Run \u201cThe Legend of Santa Demo.exe\u201d\r\n \t\r\n</li><li>Trust software if \tprompted.
