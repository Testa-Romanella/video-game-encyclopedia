Eatable things will also come in handy - from their absorption health is restored, which is very necessary in battles. Useful things meet abundantly, their qualities are diverse, and they have a stable demand - you can sell or change them for something else in the city. The city is present at each of the levels of the game. In the city you can even play on the sweepstakes - to bet on yourself. For example, that you will never be killed, do not suffer damage more than the specified amount, or perform the task strictly up to a certain time. Heroes of the game are skilled in battles - they can even hold several different weapons in the same hand, summing their effects in one stroke. As you progress, the characters gain experience. With experience comes skill. If the experience is not enough, you can always recruit more, having passed any level repeatedly.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2013-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T17:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/19891af3c3e0b2d0b9414ec101a9e822.jpg", "website": "http://www.sacred-world.com/", "rating": 2.73, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1694, "beaten": 39, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 42, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 87, "ratings_count": 123, "suggestions_count": 577, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 124, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Deep Silver", "Southend Interactive", "Southend"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
