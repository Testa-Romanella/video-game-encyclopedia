{"id": 582948, "slug": "cart-craze", "name": "Cart Craze", "name_original": "Cart Craze", "description": "<p>Cart Craze is a 2D side-scrolling race against the clock where players must guide a sentient piece of fruit through a supermarket and into a patron\u2019s shopping cart, all while either evading or defeating all the junk food trying to stop them. A rather casual experience at its core, Cart Craze is a short, charming, goofy, and fun time that players should only take a few minutes to complete. Players can choose from a small assortment of different fruits to play as, each presenting a different playstyle for players to try, and for those that wish to challenge themselves there is the option of trying to beat their old record time. Try out Cart Craze yourself and see how quickly you can get to the cart!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A fun blend of traditional and pixel art, giving Cart Craze an interesting visual style\r\n  </li><li>Three different characters to play as, each with a different ability and movement\r\n  </li><li>A fun, casual experience for those looking for a bit of fun, or a slightly more intense speed-running experience for those looking to best themselves.\r\n  </li><li>Sentient food everywhere\r\n  </li><li>Mean junk food looking to ruin your day\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5e558b072c6994a00edbff14c3f7b5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emeraldman", "ACT1993", "BirdCraftSSB", "MrKurg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
