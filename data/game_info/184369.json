Survive as long as you can as you move faster and faster!</p><p>- Teleporter: remaining a constant size, you don't grow in size when eating apples. Instead, you get teleported to a new location on the map. Better have quick reflexes!</p><p>- Race Against Time: a third obstacle is introduced, which is time. Run out of time, and you lose! Stay alive by eating apples that, in addition to increasing your size, adds a few seconds to your time. Better be punctual in eating those apples!</p><p>- Mirror: same as the Classic mode except...your controls are reversed! Down goes up, right goes left, and vice versa for each. Try not to get too confused!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2af8fceb6319dd79e478196d16506f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gamecoder95"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
