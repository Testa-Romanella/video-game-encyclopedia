You are a lost astronaut, floating alone in the empty and endless space. Your oxygen is running out and your only hope is to use the distress signal system in your spacesuit. A computerized voice responds from afar. It comes from a space drone flying by. He may be able to save you, but he won't do it immediately. He has a question for you first: HOW CAN I KNOW YOU ARE HUMAN? In this short and poetic experience, you'll be able to express yourself solely with your distress signals. This would require you to be creative when you'll try to explain the human spirit to a curious robot. And if you're lucky, you'll convince him to save you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T03:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e599166a7467b010833e8d87c6486c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["PeanutButton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
