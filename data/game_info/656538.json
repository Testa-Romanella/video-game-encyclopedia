Just go. But she also ask you to<strong> not make any trouble</strong> crossing the city.\u00a0Simple, isn't it\u00a0?\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And what about grandpa\u00a0?</em></p>\n<p>Can you make it without breaking anything ?</p>\n\r\n[About the development]\r\n<p><em>This is my first game jam. Every criticism is welcome since it is constructive.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was alone working on this game that I\u00a0started\u00a0right when the Game Jam started. I made everything by myself using Unity including scripts, programming, logic, and graphics. I didn't make sounds due to the lack of time so I picked them on\u00a0https://freesound.org/home/. Except for the sounds, everything used in this project was made during the Game Jam.\u00a0This is also my first time doing pixel art and pixel art animation, so please be gentle c:</p>\n<p><em>I recorded everything while working and I'll make a video about it soon. Link will be put here.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing my game c:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer :\u00a0It's possible<br/><br/></em></p>\n\n\n<em>\u00a0- Known issues -</em>\n<p><em>On some computer the game over screen doesn't trigger when attackers reach you or when time is out.
