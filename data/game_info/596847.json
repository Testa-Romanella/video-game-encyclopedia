You cannot move upward. You can slow your decent, but you will never get back to where you were. Survival is hard, and success is never guaranteed. There's a menu in-game that shows where the colliders are for the enemies. Didn't want them to be too small or too big, gave them a head, to about halfway through their body, except the angler. \u00a0My first game jam game, I hope you enjoy. Planning on adding more to it eventually and releasing it on Google Play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f9c7edc94f247038a730848f409efff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StyledSnail"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
