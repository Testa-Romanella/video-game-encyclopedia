It was released in North America on July 1994.</p>\n<p>Unlike other games of the era, Super Godzilla is not a straight action game. Instead, the player must guide Godzilla into the different levels by pressing the adequate button in the appropriate place. The game is split in two screens: the top one shows the actions Godzilla is making at the moment, while the bottom one shows his location on the current level. When Godzilla finds a monster to battle, the game switches into a standard side-view fighting segment.</p>\n<p>This game uses Bagan, a monster that was originally supposed to fight Godzilla in a feature film. It substitutes the Heisei Mechagodzilla with the original Mechagodzilla in the North American version of the game because Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II had not been released in North America at the time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0abe8ec7d27fa1492e8508844a83113e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Advance Communication Company"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Toho"], "esrb_rating": null}
