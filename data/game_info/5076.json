These factions are eager to take over the world and represent multiple nations joined up into one.</p>\n<h3>Factions</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s factions are the same in gameplay, yet every one of them features a distinct visual style. </p>\n<p>The Freemen are much like the ancient tribal societies and respect the environment they live in. All their units are built up using wood and other natural materials. Their territories look like farms with many windmills.</p>\n<p>The Pirates make a living by robbing others. They also resort to trading with other factions. The units of this faction appear to be made out of scrap metal. Their territories look like deserts with occasional buildings.</p>\n<p>The Cartel resembles a group of corporations which profit from mining natural resources. They heavily use materials to build their units and their territories look to be urbanistic.</p>\n<p>The Empire is the only sustained government in the game. It is highly industrialized and militarized. Their units and territories feature a lot of steel.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Greed Corp is a turn-based game that takes place on a field of collapsing tiles. Credits are gained by harvesting resources on the tiles. If the players harvest too fast, the tile begins to collapse. The players have to completely annihilate their opponent to win a game using troops, harvesters, and transporters.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2010-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-24T10:39:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7933fec6385f898777b7ad44a2b84efd.jpg", "website": "http://www.greedcorp.com", "rating": 2.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 936, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 48, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vanguard Games", "Valcon Games", "Invictus", "W!Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Valcon Games", "Invictus Games", "Vanguard Entertainment Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
