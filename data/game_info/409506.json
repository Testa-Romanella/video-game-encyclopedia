All you can see is darkness and dust. Millions of questions enter your mind but one stands out and repeats itself: Who am I? A strange feeling of emptiness surrounds you.

With great determination you roll out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e89613a8b167a7fa0b125e281078514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KleinM"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
