The wind is suffocating. The people are suspicious. Outlaws roam free and corruption is an everyday fact of life. Between the small towns littered across the continent is a vast wilderness where no sane person would dare to venture. <br/><br/>You are entirely out of your element, but there's no turning back now. Take those pictures like you were told to do, and try not to say anything stupid.<br/><br/>Trail of the Wretched is a bleak visual novel set on a fictional continent inspired by the old west. You play as a photographer sent across the ocean to capture the New World in all its untamed and horrible beauty.<br/><br/>You'll argue with the voices in your head, witness unspeakable acts, cross rivers, acquire a fancy new coat, put your head in a noose, and maybe, just maybe, you'll say something profound.<br/><br/><h3>Length: 1-2 Hours.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T06:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d30425ed06ee88687ad1476b8fb7634a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xavier Bell"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xavier Bell"], "esrb_rating": null}
