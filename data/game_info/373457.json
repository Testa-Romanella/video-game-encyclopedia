The player takes control of a creature that sprung to life after a global catastrophe, and must explore the now linked environments and soon learns that he is quite unique. His journey explores the cause of his uncommon looks, the habits of both cultures and the nature of the world.<br/><br/>Authors: Nicola Zaltron, Luisa Zurlo, Simon B\u00f8g, Kasper Brogard Kempf, Mikkel Juul Jensen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5efd51350913b541ab18289a0a58663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicola Zaltron", "Lulliflores", "kasperkempf", "Sdbcoding"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
