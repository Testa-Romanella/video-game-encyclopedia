This is a visual novel game that I made for my Advanced Sound Design Class for Games. For the final project we were tasked with making a game featuring entirely original sound effects and music. I made all of the music, sound effects, art, and also came up with the story and did the programming. This is my first major solo project so I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Alt+F4: End Game</p>\n<p>Right Arrow Key: Next Page</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T02:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c48fcc1ce368f04d87ffeb85259e654b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtificialGalaxy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
