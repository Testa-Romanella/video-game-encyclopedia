Escape the Prison and find the other Sorrows....</em></p><p><em>\"There is much to do......\"</em></p><p><strong>The Last Sorrow </strong>is currently under development so the Prototype features 4 sections of a much larger level. </p><p>Just some tips with the Prototype itself :</p><p>- Take your time with the combat. If you don't use your shield you will die quite fast. So try balance out the combination of sword and shield.</p><p>- Your health goes back to full at the start of each section. This is just to keep people playing for now, but will be removed in the future.</p><p>- As for the Boss. He can incredibly tricky and unfair at first. Try and learn his patterns and <em>be patient</em>. He's a lot easier than he appears to be.</p><p><strong>Programming/Art/Story : Dan Mc Grath</strong></p><p><strong>Music : Jim Mc Grath</strong></p><p>If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear it you can contact me at the following :</p><p><strong>Twitter :</strong> @daninfiction</p><p><strong>Dev Blog :</strong> Tooth and Claw Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f39b0c2af709f1c02d4113f249f2cee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToothandClaw"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
