{"id": 422720, "slug": "nyc-mid", "name": "NYC-MID", "name_original": "NYC-MID", "description": "<p>For the midterm project, I tried to bring my old memory when I prepared to live and study in NYC, back in Korea. You, the player, will explore two spaces (my house in Korea and Washington Square Park) and have to find three items that change a scene in NYC somehow. You can move the player with WASD key. Unfortunately, the game does not require a jump, so there is no jump function. The white dot in the middle is where your pointer is located. Thus, click an item while the white dot is on it. There is no bad ending since we (my classmates) all succeeded in studying in New York. I chose this topic since this memory is the moment that let me be myself now. Without preparation, even though it was annoying at that moment, I could not make it meet a new environment.<br/>\u00a0<br/>I tried hard to make my game high-quality for the first time, so I spent a lot of time modeling specific objects. But I realized that I was running out time and urgently moved on to the fundamental system building. I regret making a mistake regarding scheduling. Yes, this was my worst decision during work. One of the funniest things during the process was that I felt NYC vibe while making the game in NJ. Experiencing NYC and campus in the virtual world made me laugh several times (half sarcasm, half for real). Learning the shader function was the most interesting part for me. I only knew that Unity had A LOT OF functions, but never knew how to use it. Shader system allowed me not only to make a first step on using various Unity features but also to motivate me to keep working. Since I enjoyed my process, I hope you will also enjoy my game.<br/>(*The game lags unlike when I play it on Unity. I guess it is because of a large file. However, I could not find a way to solve it. I am sorry for the inconvenience).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f1459487b01bd2150437069f36f6062e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SoYeonKim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
