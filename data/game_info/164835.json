The game is a bit different as well -- reach the Christmas tree's star to reset the pile and level up and begin stacking again.</p><p>Line up the Christmas presents carefully before you drop them to create towering stacks of blocks. Stack the Christmas presents densely if going for score, or drop the presents into narrow towers if going for the tallest tower. How many presents can you stack before your block tower crumbles? Try to keep your tower of Christmas presents balanced!</p><p>Balance is the key to stacking blocks. Knowing when and where to drop blocks will allow you to stack them up into the tallest block towers. Line up the block, then tap to drop blocks where they fit best. Or just drop the Christmas presents wherever you want and challenge yourself to build a block stack that wobbles out of balance.</p><p>Super simple controls, easy to learn - even a toddler can play! This Christmas stacking game starts easy, but becomes more challenging as you progress. Just in time for Christmas, and great for quick casual gaming sessions any time, anywhere!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f2328b5954976413b3f3a01107393556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danisobo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
