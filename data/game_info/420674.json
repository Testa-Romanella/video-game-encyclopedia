To do so you'll have to add trees and leaves all over the city to weaken the building.<br/></p>\n<p>Rules of the game:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You start at the LEFT, and the goal is to invade the whole city with plants.</p>\n<p>You can only put plant next to another plant. We have attack plants that will destroy buildings. Buildings are also dealing damage to plants, the city tries to reduce the progression of nature.</p>\n<p>There are different types of plant, including attacking plants, healing plants and invasive plants. Other plants allow you to advance in the game by obtaining points called \"Biomass\". Buildings can be destroyed and turned to green as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>Sounds provided by Zapsplat (https://www.zapsplat.com)</p>\n<p>Graphism made by Impleisque, Halleicks, Xibitt and Thornado.<br/></p>\n<p>Code and level design made by Gadelan, Kauzarc , Adblackx and Lordinator.</p>\n<p>Game design made by everyone of us.</p>\n<p>Thanks you for organizing/participating in this game jam!</p>\n<p>Bybye.
