Everything! Should you investigate?

Alternatively, best viewed in the frame if you wish to admire the typography (such that it is). I can't win, really.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is my first <em>Twine</em> game! It's intentionally small as part of a series I'm working on to practice my narrative skills (and a little bit of pixel art).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI hope you enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mandy J Watson (@mandyjwatson): Game design, narrative and writing, programming, and art</li>\n<li>Fonts: Berkshire Swash by Brian J Bonislawsky DBA Astigmatic (AOETI) (Open Font Licence) and Alike Angular by Sveta Sebyakina, Alexei Vanyashin, and Cyreal (Open Font Licence)</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91bb2a4ef89baa7d89a1e9194ed5f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mandy J Watson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
