My original plan was to use it as a placeholder, then replace evrything with my own assets. As you will see pretty fast, this isn't what happened.</p>\n<p>I realized that making assets was <em>hard</em>. Took me months to make the main character, and it killed my motivation when I realized I still had to do the secondary character AND the monsters AND the combat sprites AND the weapons AND the combat animations AND the items AND the tiles. And then I could start coding.</p>\n<p>So this game has one original sprite. That's it. It's a very good one though</p>\r\nWhat I learned\r\n<ul>\n<li>Doing sprites takes time</li>\n<li>You probably have to do more sprites than you think</li>\n<li>Pixelart is great, and is probably easier to start than 3D or normal drawing. But it doesn't scale well: once you get a 3D model, every animation you make uses the same model, and cover all directions. Pixelart means you have to do every single frame of every single direction.</li>\n<li>It increases exponentially: every character you add means more walking/running/idle animations, for four directions, more combat sprites, more combat animations, etc. Even deciding to add a different running animation, or to add one more frames to animation is a significant amount of work</li>\n<li>My advice: measure how long it takes you to do a frame, a tile, and take it into account when deciding how many animations/characters/animation per frames/skill animations you want</li></ul>\n<p>Github project page</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caab753aaf46a37933f39ac61c752b0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mikalichou"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
