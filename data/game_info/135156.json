But the controls are explained in game, so you didn't have to read this after all</p>\n<p>I made it solo, and I didn't have enough time to finish it to the point I wanted to so some parts of the game are kinda rough around the edges (I did the game in about 3 days from scratch)</p>\n<p>Oh also the settings don't work... So use the console to change the settings (sorry!)</p>\n<p>I used some sounds from soundly (for ambient noises)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ec4c92365a444d76db6e034b4aaa4ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vivi512"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
