If 3 of the same color are aligned, it's a MATCH. You will find tools along your way to help with this task.<br/></p>\n<p>Beware, you are also colored ;)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>the balance is meh. Runs are short: 10min. More of \u00a0a boss rush than a dungeon. I didn't manage to get the time to brew an interesting dungeon map with this mechanic.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls are in the game, written at the bottom of the screen.<br/></p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>You can also MATCH along diagonals.</li><li>Type Space to activate time freeze. There is a cooldown which decreases when you make MATCHes. So better optimise.</li><li>You also gain a bit of life for each MATCH.</li><li><strong>It actually hurts you to get MATCHed. </strong>(at least until you find some items).</li><li>Bosses (the 4 letters in square) should be the target of your efforts.</li><li>The AI never causes a MATCH to happen by itself, even if it would kill you.</li><li>You can inspect things with Enter.</li><li>You can inspect yourself to see your current powers.</li></ul>\r\nAuthors\r\n<ul><li>Drestin: programming, game design, lore</li><li>lehomar2vinci: , Music, SoundFX</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Made in TypeScript</li><li>Mostly own engine, with some stuff from rot.js</li><li>Fonts: FiraCode, Simple Mood</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/14274774709d803fd3c91e82c756db3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drestin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
