You'll never run out of things to play. <br/><br/>I, Flynn, the creator of Bits and overall legend am busy at work making you, new games every single day! I never sleep! I'm so tired! How bloody lucky are ya mate. Yep<br/><br/>Honestly, I make whatever comes to mind when I look out the window, whatever peaks my interest ya know, whatever makes my ears go up and I convert that inspo into code and design like a kangaroo magician just for you, your eyeballs, ears and fingers to enjoy. Aw<br/><br/>From super annoying 2D puzzles to engaging 3D action games, I've tried to make something for everyone. But look out, crikey a croc! Bits will keep your brain sharp and ya fingers movin. K<br/><br/>You also ONLY get 6 rounds per day. So you don't waste your time playing games all day, go live ya life and get stuff done. Get out there and be your best self, help others and all that. But FIRST play bits in the morning... or at lunch or whatever... then do that other stuff later.<br/><br/>In addition I'd like to note that Bits is like a fine wine from Sicily, it just gets better and better with time. Each day that passes, Bits grows stronger and more interesting. Np<br/><br/>Anyway, enough talk trying to convince you... you've already made your mind up to download now and join the growing community of absolute legends, all of us playing each and every day.<br/><br/>Developed by Flynn in the down under, 'shrimp on the barbie' land of Australia.
