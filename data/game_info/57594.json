Released for MS-DOS, the Sega Saturn, and the PlayStation, the game puts players in control of a tank, and tasks them with destroying enemy forces. It has often been likened to Return Fire.<br />\nThe MS-DOS version was developed first, with the console versions following later. BMG Interactive initially stated that the game would be retitled &quot;Tank&quot; for its European release, but the game ultimately retained its original title of Mass Destruction on all releases.<br />\nWhile some reviewers described the game as &quot;simplistic&quot; and &quot;mindless&quot;, others found its stripped-down action enjoyable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-02T14:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b79916e6af29fb9ec61deb77ebde6875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["NMS Software"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["ASC Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
