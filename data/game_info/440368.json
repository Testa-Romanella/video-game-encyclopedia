Movement is done with the WASD keys and you may turn the camera by moving the mouse. You can fire darts that cause noise by pressing the left mouse button. You can also hold CTRL to crouch or press C to toggle crouching. To exit the game, press the ESCAPE key.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is no objective in the build, but you are free to play around with the enemies in the game. There are two types, guards who patrol the lower floors and hunters who are capable of jumping. In this build there is a bug with the hunters that cause them to not patrol, but they will search for and chase the player. To the left of the player's starting position are also two windows that the player may break with their dart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:33:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/edeb7acf4610670fe644de0ec4939345.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simugens"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
