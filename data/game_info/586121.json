Not to worry, strap your seatbelt in and take a trip back Intime. Welcome to the plague stricken fantasy world of Plague Masters! Journey back into medieval times where plague, famine, magic and myth are all prevalent topics of discussion. Journey through the region of Callapar and advance your combat, skills and adventure so that you can help stop the plague from spreading through all the lands. Be careful though, the further you adventure away from Callapar the more likely you are to become diseased by the plague! At the same rate, your more likely to find treasure and reward!<br/><br/><br/>So your looking for a bit of jewels are you? Are you the type of bloke willing to risk his life for a wooden chest of gold and ruby's? Well your in the right place that's for sure, Plague Masters has excellent content for the adventuring type folk. Secrets are hidden all over the world of Plague Masters ready for players to uncover them. So next time your walking by that waterfall and your thinking \"It would be so neat if there was a secret passage behind it\" it may be worth investigating further. Defeating mighty foes, completing epic quest lines, searching for treasure, finding secret zones, completing puzzles and pulling levers will all satisfy your in adventure seeker!<br/><br/><br/>Love working with your hands? Great with a hammer and nails? Do not fret, Plague Masters have you covered. Plague Masters at its core is a 2D MMORPG and thus it would not be complete without an extensive skill system for crafting and gathering. Mine for ores, smelt your ores into bars and create your own weapon and equipment! Gather medicinal herbs to create potential cures for the plague, or add bonus effectiveness towards disease to your equipment. Craft razor blades or knives for blood letting, ferment your own beer and more! Almost all items in game are craftable by the players. Sure you can easily head to the local blacksmith to buy your armor, but if you want truly unuiqe and rare armor it must be crafted!<br/><br/><br/>Ah, player killing... This is where things get interesting, dangerous and sickly. As you adventure further and further away from Callapar (City Safe Zone). You will start to notice the world start to infect you with disease and make you sick. This could be an area that is plagued, a monster you fight that has the plague, some in game object and more. When you notice your disease bar starts to fill you must be on high caution and try to remedy this as soon as possible. Here is why, when you leave the safe constraints of Callapar or other safe zones the rest of the world is unsafe. By unsafe I mean other players can attack you. Though, with great risk is greater reward! Some of the games best treasure and secrets lie within these regions. What makes our pvp different from the rest, let me explain. Players can equip weapons and armor that provide some immunity to disease and also cast spells that make other players sick and infected with the plague. The more disease you have when you die, the more items and gold you loose upon death. So you have high incentive to rack the players disease bar up, and keep your self free from the plague. Now remember, on top of items and magic that can raise the sickness of the play, monsters, objects and the environment itself can effect this. The deeper you stray away from safe zones, the more challenging the environments will become.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:10:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe9d478f5a1bd7fa38e35042ff1088d.jpg", "website": "https://plaguemastersgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 464, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Matter"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Dark Matter"], "esrb_rating": null}
