The twist? Your motors are jammed and <em>you can only turn right</em> (<strong>Space Bar</strong>)! Play strategically and try to keep up with the growing alien invasion to see how long you can survive! <em>Can you win a gold medal?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs / Problems:</strong></p>\n<p>- There are no explosions when enemies are destroyed</p>\n<p>- The difficulty curve is insane. You die very quickly around the 80 point mark and the only known way to get a gold medal is to use an auto-clicker. Additionally, it is also too easy in the early game, and even while AFK you are likely to get a bronze medal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out our previous game jam submissions here:\u00a0https://ericli3690.itch.io/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:57:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb0/eb0d775e150b32b4a9164f6e503918ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Last Minute Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
