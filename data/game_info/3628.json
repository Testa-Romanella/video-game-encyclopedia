{"id": 3628, "slug": "sacred-3", "name": "Sacred 3", "name_original": "Sacred 3", "description": "<p>Sacred 3 is a hack\u2019n\u2019slash game, a third installment in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game starts with a brief introduction to the fantasy world of Ancaria. The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and other features</h3>\n<p>The game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses.  The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 57, "released": "2014-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79bcdd4724582082bebdfc106c939d94.jpg", "website": "http://www.sacred-world.com", "rating": 2.66, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1158, "beaten": 53, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 66, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 139, "suggestions_count": 653, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 139, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Deep Silver", "Keen Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": null}
