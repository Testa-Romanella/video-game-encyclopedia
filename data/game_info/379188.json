Quicktober!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This year all of the squiggles are released on day one so you can do things at your own pace, whether <br/></p>\n<p>Each\u00a0squiggle\u00a0is a starting point for you to get some creativity on, you can either print it out by doing this:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Or you can just redraw the squiggle\u00a0on your own piece of paper, or save the\u00a0squiggle\u00a0to your computer b/c this isn't inktober, there's no problem with drawing however you want. (Including mixing the Quicktober squiggles with other\u00a0prompts)</p>\n<p>And if you miss a day, you can use more than one squiggle in your art. You can place them wherever you want, upside down or sideways or back to front.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you manage to use every\u00a0squiggle\u00a0and show me your art then I'll draw you a prize!</p>\n<p>But this is entirely for people to not feel stressed or like they have to make masterpieces. It's good for you to doodle and get some art going, but if it's all weighing on you too much, it's far better for you to get a nice hot cup of $drink and sit down with your favourite $thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Otherwise go ahead!\u00a0Have some fun!\u00a0Do some doodles! And have a great Quicktober!
