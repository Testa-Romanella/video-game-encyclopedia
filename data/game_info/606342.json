You relive an individual named 'Wilbur' die over and over again, and feel immense sadness for this supposed stranger.</p>\n<p>That is why, when the train finally makes a stop, you take it as your sign to explore the foreign memory inside you.</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This is a short fan-game for the DSMP\u00a0that is primarily built because of two reasons: i had ideas about Wilbur's afterlife, and that I miss Technoblade and needed a way to pass the time.</p>\n<p>This is built from my headcannons and some canonical information!
