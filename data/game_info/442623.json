Explore a lush alien planet by spaceship or on foot. You also have a jetpack to help you get around, but keep in mind it doesn't work as well at high altitudes.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move and x to leave and enter your spaceship.</p>\n<p>This project was practice for making more detailed, immersive environments by merging handmade and procedurally generated methods, within the strict confines of pico-8.
