It's every bull for themselves in a back-stabbing, treasure-grabbing struggle, and only one may survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle...<br/><br/><strong>Bullion: The Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle</strong> is a local multiplayer brawler for up to four players, featuring a cast of backstabbing bovine buccaneers and a unique blend of PvP and co-op gameplay. <br/><br/>Stranded on the Islands of Ser-Lloyn, the heathen gods have declared that only the one bringing the greatest offering of treasure shall live - so each pirate must grab as much loot as they can! Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T04:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e8271d457942fcdf26d6225756b0e9c4.jpg", "website": "https://www.bulliongame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leda Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Leda Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
