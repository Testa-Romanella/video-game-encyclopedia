Playing as Loren, you navigate the dreamscape to get Loren's long lost friend Violet back to the real world after she mysteriously appeared in Loren's town for the first time in years. Discover a deeper meaning to Loren's myserious dreams and Violet's apparitions.Features<ul><li><strong>Unique gameplay experience</strong><br/>The gameplay in Going Nowhere: The Dream is inspired by games like Mirror's Edge, movement mods for other games, and \"parkour\", but has more navigational challenge to it instead of relying on speed. Speedrunning is encouraged however!  <br/></li><li><strong>Loren's Story</strong><br/>Playing as Loren, you travel between her dreams and the \"real world.\" The main story can be played linearly, but there are a lot of secrets and questions that become more clear as they are discovered and pieced together. While the story is a big part of the game, Going Nowhere: The Dream is NOT a walking simulator! <br/></li><li>Secrets upon secrets!<br/>This game has been saturated with secrets. No, not little collectables that you can find on the ground to get a 100%. There are secrets that can change the ending of the game, easter eggs, references, things in the game you are not expected to even find, some of which you have to glitch the game to get to. Almost every Steam achievement in this game will be a very hard to find secret. Good luck, adventurers!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/26678208143185a76c60a7390578aefa.jpg", "website": "http://www.stephanhaldaman.com/goingnowherethedream.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 21}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nowhere Town", "Sushin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nowhere Town"], "esrb_rating": null}
