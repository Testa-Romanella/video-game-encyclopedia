{"id": 560790, "slug": "thearchy", "name": "Thearchy", "name_original": "Thearchy", "description": "The game is a difficult dungeon-crawler style game. It has a simple, yet elegant pixel art style. There is no true win condition, you do what satisfies you. The game is highly influenced by cults and religion that you and other characters can explore. It is situated in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic Earth setting. The world is full of raiders, mutants, wild animals, aliens, other humans, and much more. You play as one of eight characters each with three skill trees that grant game changing perks attained by leveling up. There are hundreds of items to find through out the game, ranging from guns, swords, hats, helmets, food, bombs, and tons of weird stuff. There are various factions  you may encounter, each with their own likes and dislikes that are affected by your choices. The game is full of features both easily apparent, and small things that you may never even find, such as dancing in fire, absorbing radiation and getting mutated, detonating atomic bombs, finding monkeys everywhere, and tons of fun stuff. With so much going on, surviving in the wasteland may prove challenging, luckily there are dozens of friendly characters willing to die fighting at your side.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame is still being worked on and so any bugs, balances, and other things needed to be altered will be fixed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc65f0980468dfb9ef03a8c02b210bff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Marty"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sean Marty"], "esrb_rating": null}
