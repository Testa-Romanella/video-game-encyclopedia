Watching the people you left behind as they grieve.</p><p>Click to interact, you can also move the GhOst with WASD and directional buttons, though I didn't get time to make that feature perform much for you in the game.</p><p>I made this in Unity but also with a plug in called Fungus, it handled all the dialogue popping up and the sequences of events. It's definitely worth a play around with cause it's simple to use.</p><p>Made as part of my game a week project. Obviously this is kinda buggy and rough but particularly... welll you'll see what I mean when you play. I still like it, wish I had more time to just add 'content' thought. So I probably will return to this at a later date.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dd04d81c20beb3f2b294af7b2f0ceea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SuperBiasedMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
