Well its just about as simple as it sounds. You can add custom words to your dictionary by locating the res/ folder then the data/ folder and by editing the words.txt. You can include spaces and no punctuation. The word you put in will automatically be shown in all uppercase in the game so the capitalization in the file does not matter. This section is really for the hardcore players or might want to repurpose the game to do studing or they just want to add dirty words to have a giggle.</p><p>GAME SOURCE IS PUBLIC : https://github.com/tsteinholz/Hangman<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1af/1af20ee693c223130582288b4d4d865d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["\u00bb \u0442\u043d\u03c3\u043c\u03b1\u0455 \u0455\u0442\u0454\u03b9\u0438\u043d\u03c3\u2113z \u00ab"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
