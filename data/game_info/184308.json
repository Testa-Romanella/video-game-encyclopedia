It looks beautiful. But after sunset, you find something strange following you. So you run, run, run... Finally, you find an old house, and you can hide in it until the sun rises. However, the house needs a key to open it. There is a letter on the door.</p>\n<p>\"The key is in the forest, not very far...\"</p>\n<p>So you decided to find the key...</p>\n<p>This game is my first game. I finished the game in a few hours. I hope you will like it. Although it is not very good.</p>\n<p>Prompt:</p>\n<p>Zombies walk faster than you, but you run faster than it does. Another way is that it is afraid of light. You can flash it with your flashlight. It may run away... But after a few seconds, it will come back soon... Another thing: opening / closing a flashlight will take a lot of batteries, try not to use a flashlight regularly, use your feet as much as possible, and use a flashlight in dangerous circumstances.</p>\n<p>*:</p>\n<p>I haven't finished the main menu, so it's very ugly now. I'll finish it in a few days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946b39387720d08ed829ca75f472b0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ddhello"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
