{"id": 256575, "slug": "spy-rhaul", "name": "Spy Rhaul", "name_original": "Spy Rhaul", "description": "<p>Spy Rhaul is a top-down aerial espionage game taking place in the mythical world of Devgamma, where the proud dragons are locked in a ceaseless war with the dragonfly coalition, who envy their much cooler image using the name Dragon. The player takes control of enigmatic dragon Mr. Rhaul, whose employment as a spy has sent him deep into enemy airspace to collect vital intelligence on the dragonfly menace. This game was created by a four-man team in 48 hours during the Video Game Development Club 2018 Proto-Game jam at the University of California, Irvine. Armed only with a one-word theme, \u201cSpiral,\u201d their wits, and a notable lack of professionally trained artists, this team worked night and day to bring you this interactive look into the dark world of dragon-based intelligence gathering.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Team lead and chief designer : Ryan N.
