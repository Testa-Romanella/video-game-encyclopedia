Taken together the episodes tell the story of three reluctant heroes who each find themselves inside Redwall Abbey for deeply personal reasons when it is besieged by Cluny the Scourge. Thrust into a suddenly dramatic situation the three strangers become fast friends and wind up in a critical, but as-yet unsung role in the events that bring the sword of Martin the Warrior to Matthias and the end to that villain Cluny the Scourge.<br/><br/>As the first episode in the series, The Scout is best understood as a stealth-adventure game set in the winter before the Summer of the Late Rose. It tells the story of a mouse who is driven to Redwall Abbey when sea rats raid the peaceful village of Lilygrove. The events of The Scout play out along the ancient, but now altered, course of the mighty River Moss. What was once a wide river is now the sunken bed of a seasonal creek that that runs east-west between Redwall Abbey and the Great South Stream that feeds the swamps south and east of Salamandastron. The player must find a way through the confusing snow-covered channel punctuated by occasional hedgerows, ancient stone walls, scattered shacks, and the few-and-far-between hearths of friendly woodlanders.<br/><br/>Along the way there is untold adventure to include (of course) feasting, fiddling, and even a few fisticuffs as we meet Valo Scrimpaw, the mysterious stoat who lives in the Winsome Wraith, Scumsnout the murderous weret and the mysterious, ghostly assistance when all seems lost.<br/><br/>Episodes 2 and 3, tentatively titled The Miner and The Archer, tell the stories of a mole and a squirrel as they too are driven to Redwall for their own reasons in the Spring and early Summer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03ccf159a025ca58a4f6a9c621cb2a53.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/RedwallGame/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soma Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Soma Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
