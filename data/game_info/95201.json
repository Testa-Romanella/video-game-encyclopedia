And to make matters worse, they're all split up, and tripping out.</p><p>The group consists of Alice, Wendy, and Dorothy. They suffer constant disagreements, over the band's style, name, and often, just with eachother.</p><p>Now they must get back together, get back to their dorms, and maaaaaybe uncover something bigger, as the hallucinations get more vivid, and the people they meet get stranger.</p>PRESS\"an increasingly surreal and trippy landscape full of rough style and offbeat humor.\" -Offworld<br/><br/><br/>\"this feels like a lost game from before indie gaming exploded, something like Treasure Adventure Game or Eternal Daughter. (i.e. it's huge and fully featured, and rather ambitious.)\" -PC Gamer<br/><br/><br/><br/>FEATURES<ul><li>Unlike a lot of adventure games, there are no fiddly item puzzles, and you navigate with the keyboard instead of the mouse. You also switch between each of the 3 main characters, to work together to find your way out.</li><li>Takes place in a huge world full of dungeons, tons of secrets, and surprises.</li><li>Over 6000 lines of dialogue</li><li>Low-Quality MSPaint Graphics- let's not lie here</li><li>3 Acts Long.
