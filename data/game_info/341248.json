Basic clicker mechanics, click to do a thing a lot of times, upgrade to make it work\u00a0better, repeat. It works pretty well but the balancing is bad and there's still a ton of details to iron out.</p>\n<p>Depths of Europa: An accident left you trapped in the watery interior of Jupiter's' moon, Europa. Collect powerups to upgrade your ship and try to survive the icy depths. This one doesn't have a lot going on yet but I have\u00a0a lot of storyline and gameplay plans that sound great on paper. Well, in my head mostly.</p>\n<p>Catventure: You are a cat dreaming of adventure! It's an action/adventure game style vaguely after top-down Legend of Zelda games and similar. Lot to finish here but you can collect a few things and kill rats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the process of smashing these games together into one executable I\u00a0actually re-familiarized myself with how the three of them work and actually added a fair bit. So I am in a much better place to continue working on them then before I started the jam. And so I\u00a0am strongly considering starting them back up, if you liked any of them and would like to see it continued please let me know!</p>\n<p><em>(There's a dumb easter egg in the game selection screen)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/3435cc2b8311abc173fa7c4a972a628a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobBoberty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
