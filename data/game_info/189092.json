You play a character from a mundane world entering a cavern enchanted from head to toe with a strange energy we might call magic. However, for our adventurer, magic is not even so much a concept so everything is alien to them. With no information on how to use the spellbook pages you're gifted, you'll have to experiment and learn how to best harness their powers on your own. Perhaps you can even find the source of this alien energy?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Drag cards (called \"pages\") from your hand near the bottom onto the enemies in the middle of the screen.</li><li>This uses that card and you'll draw a new card to replace it. The enemies then have a turn to attack you.\u00a0</li><li>The game is a deck builder so each non-combat encounter there will be a chance a card is added to your deck.\u00a0</li><li>Cards can apply various status effects but the cards themselves have no card text as your character cannot read the strange writing. Instead you'll have to experiment to find combos!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9def6e7ce2ac118a879b0e5f155e695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Stranger Space"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
