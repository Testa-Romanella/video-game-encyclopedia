{"id": 762620, "slug": "uru-demystified-a-demake", "name": "Uru: DeMystified (a demake)", "name_original": "Uru: DeMystified (a demake)", "description": "<p>This is a demake and reinterpretation of the game Uru. It contains three worlds inspired by worlds from Uru, but reinterpreted to fit the Bitsy engine. If you are a fan of Myst, Riven, or any other puzzle game, then I think you'll enjoy it.</p>\n<p>[it seems itch is having trouble uploading screenshots right now. will add them once issue is resolved.]<br/></p>\n<p>Because this was made in Bitsy, <strong>there is no sound, music, and most importantly no saves</strong>. I'm sorry about that. This game was originally supposed to be so short that you wouldn't need the ability to save. The game wound up being bigger than I planned (Bitsy isn't really built for making games like this). Maybe you still don't need saves to beat it (I have no gauge on how long it takes to finish), but I still feel bad for not having any.</p>\n<p>The game <em>is</em> non-linear so even if you lose \"progress\" by closing the window it's not a huge deal.<strong> (Knowing how all the puzzles work, I can complete everything in about 15 minutes so I'm randomly going to multiply that by 4 and say it'll take about 1 hour for someone to complete it in one sitting.)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, even though the game wound up being a real pain to finish, I'm really proud of some of the puzzles and stories here, and I think the pain was worth it. Btw, I am not a visual artist; I don't know how shapes or colors work, so if stuff looks bad, I'm sorry for that too!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T16:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15f5607a0a1ffde0320631d85ad1b93c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phillingtime"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
