I got much further then my LD40 entry and that makes me really proud. Like most everyone i was really upset at the theme, but after watching people come up with ideas i came around to the idea of combining a card game + farming sim (think sim farm of the 90s)</p>\n<p>Harvest: The Farming</p>\n<p>Is a deck building game where you manage a farm.</p>\n<p>Given an initial deck of cards you manage a farm (sim farm style) Throughout play you can gain new cards, plants grow, and you try to protect against insects, weeds and weather(flooding). Good luck!</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<ul><li>Drag and Drop are the controls</li><li>Cards will recycle when used or discarded (certain cards will not)</li><li>You will gain new cards at different score levels (both positive and negative)</li></ul>\n<p>Things i didn\u2019t finish:</p>\n<ul><li>Art - there are still a few placeholder images i didn\u2019t have time to draw replacements for</li><li>Cards - There are only 13 unique cards in the game (can you find them all)</li><li>Start/Help Menus</li></ul>\n<p>Hope you all enjoy and I look forward to your feedback!!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/621cacbab139996d5a5a143f2c56bd27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RedOwlGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
