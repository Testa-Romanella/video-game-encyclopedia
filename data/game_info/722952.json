Before I do that I wanted to plan out the entire game on paper first. Since Trijam is a jam about planning I wanted to use this to put my planning skills to the test.\r\n </p>\r\nIdea\r\n<p>My original idea was to make a game that is close to what I do so I made a game about daily programmer life. The idea was to capture the feeling of being a programmer having to get work done and getting distracted having to do other tasks.\r\n </p>\n<p>During gameplay, you are supposed to solve programming problems. These are of the type \u201cFill in the blanks\u201d and during you solving those problems you are interrupted with having to perform a code review on other developers' work.\r\n </p>\r\nDesign\r\n<p>You get 100 points for solving a programming problem. The criteria to solve a problem is to write in the correct string expected at the line caret and then press enter.\r\n </p>\n<p>Between every 7 to 15 seconds a code review is initiated. During this time you are not allowed to use the keyboard to write solutions anymore and instead, you have to read the code review message and determine if the code is going to be accepted or not. If you accept a bad code you get a penalty of losing 50 points while accepting good code awards you 25 points.\r\n </p>\n<p>Other than the code reviews being a distraction I added a bad CRT monitor that makes it harder to see as well as a lot of background noise for you when working.\r\n </p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul> <li>A - Z on your keyboard to write solutions on the monitor.\r\n </li><li>Mouse movement and left mouse click to choose \u201cAccepted\u201d or \u201cRejected\u201d on a code review.\r\n </li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Computer screen: https://www.deviantart.com/halfingr/art/Vectorized-CRT-Monitor-Stock-PNG-292314284 Wooden Table: https://openclipart.org/detail/284533/wooden-table-from-glitch Office background: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radio_Lora_M\u00fcnchen_-_Inside_Radio_Station_01.jpg Vectorized line papers: https://freesvg.org/lined-pages-vector-image White paper pattern: https://pixabay.com/sv/photos/papper-textur-scrapbooking-753508/ Approve &amp; Reject buttons: https://pixabay.com/sv/illustrations/st\u00e4mpel-godk\u00e4nna-sudd-passera-2114884/\r\n </p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>All feedback is appreciated.
