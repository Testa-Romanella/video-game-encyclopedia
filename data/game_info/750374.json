Part 3 of &#39;Jenesis&#39; adds 12 extra maps to the first twenty (which have all also been modified for the better in some way or another) and replaces the final map, as its predecessor did.</p>\n<p>&#39;Jenesis&#39; is a 32-level megawad for Boom, complete with a new final boss, a new monster, new status bar graphics and a recolored message font.</p>\n<p>The aim of this project was mainly to hone my skills in traditional Doom level design, but it was also to create a presentable set of maps which pulled inspiration from the great megawads like the Memento Mori duology, Hell Revealed, Alien Vendetta, Requiem and Scythe. These are just some of the mapsets out there that Jenesis pays homage to, thematically.</p>\n<p>This is the megawad&#39;s final release. In total it has taken about one year and one month of hard mapping, bugtesting and procrastination to complete. :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T13:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a629576e3a40ff2913a2cec1c3accb8f.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/jenesis", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
