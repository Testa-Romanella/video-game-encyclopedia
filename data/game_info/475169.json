In the game the player is only equipped with a flashlight and his strong will power.<br/></p>\n<p>The main goal of the game is to find eight notes (\"pages\") which are attached to various places around the map. The player cannot interact with the environment in any other way; apart from the movement controls, the only controls available are to turn the flashlight [Mouse 1 or Control]\u00a0on and off, pick up a page [E], and run [Shift].</p>\n<p>In this version, the\u00a0Slender Man, starts appearing after 10 seconds into the game. Aside from that, in this version the Slender man\u00a0teleports with regularity intervals between randomly selected locations, within a maximum range of the player, that are outside of the player's view. If Slender Man obtains an unbroken line of sight to the player, he starts to move fast\u00a0 towards the player until he catches the player. Each time a page is collected, or a particular amount of time elapses, the interval between Slender Man's teleports reduces and the maximum move range increases as well. The game also varies the background sound effects each time a new page is collected.</p>\n<p>Some of the sound effect, art and atmosphere\u00a0were choosen to create a sense of nostalgia.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my spin on\u00a0the great classic Slender: The Eight Pages.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave your thoughts on the comments down below!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and best regards,\u00a0</p>\n<p>ChrisShowdown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T02:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a793b641e583ebe413a5a80225ebd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisShowdown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
