It follows the adventures of Morgan and his best friend Elliot as they play and have fun in the happy little village Morgan\u2019s ship crashed into many years ago.<br/><br/><strong>MORGAN LIVES IN A ROCKET HOUSE in VR</strong> is home to Morgan\u2019s first VR episode: <strong>PAPER PILOTS</strong>. Morgan and Elliot want to fly planes but they know they can\u2019t - they're just little kids! Maybe they can make paper planes instead, but um\u2026 they can\u2019t remember how.  Hopefully someone can teach them.FEATURES<br/><ul><li><strong>PAPER PILOTS:</strong> The first VR episode of MORGAN LIVES IN A ROCKET HOUSE (running Time: 4 minutes).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>TELEPORTING:</strong> Jump around the village after the show, or re-watch the cartoon from different positions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>SIZE MODES:</strong> Watch the cartoon from different perspectives.
