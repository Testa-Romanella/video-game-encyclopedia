Andromache.<br/><br/>So what if its maiden voyage is to retrace the route of its ill-fated sister ship, the S.S. Cassandra, which disappeared inside the perilous Bermuda Triangle almost 100 years before? The media will hype anything for a story and the liner company is only too happy for the extra publicity.<br/><br/>But when things aboard ship start to go awry, Maddie soon realises she\u2019ll have more to deal with than demanding passengers and annoying co-workers. Could she be the key to changing events set in motion almost a century ago, or will the mystery of the Devil\u2019s Triangle claim her too?<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>The full game will feature:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>approximately 70,000 words\u00a0</li><li>Realistic 'serving onboard a cruise ship' action!</li><li>\u00a08 CGs\u00a0</li><li>3 romance routes</li><li>8 endings</li></ul>\n<p>Release date:\u00a0 16th February 2018</p>\n<p>Price:\u00a0\u00a32.99 (approximately \u00a0$4.00)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961337aaa76bf8346ed04d2ec906c9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Blackcross & Taylor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
