Features a speed setting, end-game messages depending on the score, and a snake which doesn't even look like one, hence the name \"Cakma Y\u0131lan (Imitation Snake)\". Doesn't feature sound. Might recieve some size optimizations in the future.</p>\n<p>The game is only in\u00a0Turkish for now, but you can find English subtitles in the featured gameplay video.</p><p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/KiwoTez/cakma_yilan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d74bd18d8087a052b518b035bcf401b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["K\u0131van\u00e7 Tez\u00f6ren"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
