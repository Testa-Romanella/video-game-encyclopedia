Was it a great war, fire raining down from the sky and poisoning the ground? Did nature fail, the air growing hot, the crops dying out? Or it may have been\u00a0something about bees. It was probably bees.</p>\n<p>But there is no doubt about what brought on the End of Time. When the hapless survivor took refuge in the old temple, hiding from who knows what (the anomaly made answering that question an impossibility), an ancient program activated, throwing the universe into a time loop until the system administrators (or their designated living descendants)\u00a0could be gathered to turn it off.</p>\n<p>You must find them! Drag the characters' timelines to change their path leading up to the cataclysm, change the choices they make in the encounters they made along the way. Any descendants who make it to the temple when it activates will too be guided by the half-broken AI who resides there (which is to say, will become playable.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c20a32d55c883b6317222923797d6f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["petet", "Jonah Pulsipher", "Xan Drake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
