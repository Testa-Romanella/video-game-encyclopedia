{"id": 54318, "slug": "snatcher", "name": "Snatcher", "name_original": "Snatcher", "description": "<p>Snatcher is a cyberpunk-themed graphic adventure game written by Hideo Kojima and produced by Konami. It was originally released in Japan for the PC-8801 and MSX2 computer platforms in 1988. A CD-ROM-based remake for the PC Engine was released in 1992, which was subsequently localized into English for the Sega CD in 1994 in North America and Europe. The enhanced version was later ported twice more to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in Japan.<br />\nThe setting and story of Snatcher are heavily influenced by cyberpunk and science-fiction media, taking place in a large futuristic dystopian city. The story revolves around an investigator named Gillian Seed assigned to investigate a breed of bioroids known as &quot;snatchers&quot;, who are killing humans and taking their place in society. Gameplay takes place in a menu-based interface. The player can choose from pre-defined options such as &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Talk&quot; to interact with the environment and its characters.<br />\nWidely acclaimed since its initial release, Snatcher is regarded as groundbreaking for the adventure genre, in that it introduced visual novel characteristics to flesh out a complex back story. Sales outside of Japan were poor due to Sega&#39;s waning support for the Sega CD, but the game has gained a cult following. The game has spawned a spin-off role-playing game released in Japan titled SD Snatcher, and a radio drama, SDATCHER.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T12:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162912e996a42c748aebd20f113bea16.jpg", "website": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher_(video_game)", "rating": 4.23, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 16, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 30, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 26, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 26, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
