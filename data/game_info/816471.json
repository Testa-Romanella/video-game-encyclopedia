Goal of the game is to get World Record and earn the achievement.<br/><br/>Score Game 2D is hard (not really just poorly coded), competitive game for those chasing the \"rare\" achievements of steam, or those who want to break keyboard like i do. And yes i know it is terrible, there is no need to tell me.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>poor physics and movement<br/></li><li>\"very hard\" to obtain achievement<br/></li><li>overpriced content (it's a feature)<br/></li><li>7 obstacles (i think)<br/></li><li>at least 30sec of gameplay</li></ul><br/>Roasts are always welcome. Made game for myself to help me learn the process of publishing and making games as that is something i wanted for a long time. Thank you for trying whatever this is, have fun, and hopefully i see you in my next game.<br/><br/>Music by Patrick de Arteaga", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T06:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04bf271130c5dd6956a6671e09bb2653.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Subreffiy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Subreffiy"], "esrb_rating": null}
