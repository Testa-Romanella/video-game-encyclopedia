The locations seem familiar to you on a map, as they correspond to burial sites of the elite Mejai, powerful warriors blessed with unnaturally long life by the high-priest Akar for the purpose of protecting the pharaoh. However, a blessing in life may be a curse in death\u2026 Ancient texts mention these warriors turned mad exceeding the bounds of mortality, bringing death and ruin to those around them. To stop them, legend tells of a group of brave Egyptians who lured each Mejai into separate tombs using invaluable relics, and then trapped them inside forever\u2026<br/><br/>While this story may be a myth, you feel obligated to investigate, as the historical and monetary value of such a discovery would be beyond your wildest dreams.
