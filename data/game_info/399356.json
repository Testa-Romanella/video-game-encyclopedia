The game starts off easy but after that, it becomes very hard to get by. Well, you could say that this is a rage game.</p>\n<p>You are the Ice Cube and you must pass each red blocks I call \"Hot Tiles\". By each level you pass, it will say \"LEVEL COMPLETE\".\u00a0 Don't mind the numbers though. You can call them points or a time number to see how far you almost made it to the finish.</p>\n<p>Also, heads up, its like a losing-loop game until you make it to the win. There is also no checkpoints. If you exit out the game and re-enter back, you'll be restarting back to level 01.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS:\u00a0 \u00a0Left = [A], Right = [D]</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I didn't add any audio or music in it because like I said, I'm a beginner. So if you're doing any posted videos with this game, you can add a music as a background.</p>\n<p>Please follow these terms to understand:</p>\n<ul><li>I will not freak out too much</li><li>I will not destroy my computer</li><li>I will always remember that there is no pause button</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading the description and enjoy my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T05:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec435347185a51fc6cc9b1989325383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zaya2100"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
