I'm particularly pleased with the idea of using statistical distribtions as platforms - still proud of that idea - and the graphics came out very nicely, particularly on the character art. And there's a lot of stuff I learned making it as well, that'll just be generally useful if I ever want to use it as a feature again, like that star system which keeps the star counts between levels, or using grids and prefabs in clever ways to make a bunch of levels quickly. Still, it did take a surprisingly long time to make this game, even if it was on and off - a full two weeks and change! I guess without a deadline things just get done slower, but at least it got done at all. I suppose part of why it took so long was because I was free to try things out more, add more features and so on, so maybe taking a long time to make the game wasn't such a bad thing. At the very least, it was definitely a different experience to making a jam game, so there's that! And, hopefully, you enjoy playing through all those levels as much as I enjoyed making them - if you manage to 100% the game, please do let me know; I'd love to hear about it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T13:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfaf4288aa9586be80fcc83440632084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
