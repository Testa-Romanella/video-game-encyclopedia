The theme was \"climbing\" and the jam has an emphasis on scoreboard play and high scores, so I made a game where you have to climb as fast and accurate as possible to get a high score!<br/><br/></p><p> Quickly fling yourself up the rungs and try to climb the mountain as fast as possible in all THREE levels! Once you complete all 3 levels, your time is aggregated and you get a TOTAL time, which of course is the most important one. You can then keep replaying and optimizing the levels to get your total time as low as possible!</p>\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\"Robobozo\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T08:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c5d90d4bfe346348a38d52bc3d5e24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zilard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
