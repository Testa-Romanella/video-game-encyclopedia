You became King of the Imperi province that you grew but now the Imperi decides that you have served your purpose and must step down. Not wanting to yield your kingdom, you decide that you would rather go to war with the Imperi instead. Their empire is much larger than yours and so is their army. Use wits to make good political decisions to defeat the Imperi and become Emperor of the free world!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nF E A T U R E S :<br/>\r\n- Simple to use and intuitive point-and-click interface<br/>\r\n- Challenging, but balanced, management simulation experience<br/>\r\n- Smart AI helps balance grain shortages to minimize calamity during famine<br/>\r\n- Text-based Strategy Simulation<br/>\r\n- Turn-based rounds (3 turns per month)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI M P R O V E M E N T S :<br/>\r\n- Turns are per month now instead of per season (allows more turns per year)<br/>\r\n- Age is now a factor. Due to complaints, the immortal ruler is gone. You must work within human age constraints.<br/>\r\n- Your actions determine the Public Approval Rating. Let it drop too low and the people will revolt and dethrone you.<br/>\r\n- The ability to hire clerics. They help contain disease, add to the contentment of the people, and help extend your life too.<br/>\r\n- Start with a full Province this time (starts at minimum stats required to beat the first game.)<br/>\r\n- You must also prepare for raids from the Imperi armies as well. The war is now symmetrical.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nClick strategy that is fun and affordable. Every attempt was made to listen to all customer feedback from the first Imperi and improve upon the concept for this one. We thank all who purchased that game and gave us feedback. We hope you will try this one too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb89825c6b013bfb24834430415830e.jpg", "website": "http://www.Morseph.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuts and Volts Electronics"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nuts and Volts Electronics"], "esrb_rating": null}
