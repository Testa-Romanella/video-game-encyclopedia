I've wanted to make video games as long as I can remember. I\u00a0attended a local community college to study Video Game Art &amp;\u00a0Animation. After graduating, I\u00a0applied to game studios, big and small, in hopes of taking my next step into the game industry. Alas, I\u00a0learned how difficult it is to get a foot in the door, and was rejected quite a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At that moment, I\u00a0decided that in order to pursue a life long dream, I would have to forge my own path.\u00a0 I\u00a0dove head first into programming and taught myself C# to use in Unity. Over the course of the next few years, I\u00a0taught myself to program games until I felt comfortable enough with C# to move forward.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've made a few small games while learning, some can be here on my\u00a0itch.io page. Toaster Defense is my first commercial release, and while it can be quite nerve wrecking to release my first game on Steam, I'm very excited to share my hard work with everyone!</p>\n<p><strong>How did Toaster Defense come into existence?</strong></p>\n<p>As I\u00a0taught myself programming, I started to learn by making the genre that pretty much every developer starts with; platformer. As I\u00a0was learning, I started to develop a 2.5D\u00a0platformer, but then I\u00a0realized two things:\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>There was nothing unique about the game.</li><li>\u00a0The game's scope was too large for me at the time. Taking these into consideration, I\u00a0wanted to make a fun, unique game that was achievable for a solo game developer.</li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0started researching other platformer games, both old and new, to brainstorm how I\u00a0could turn my 2.5D platformer into something unique. There was one game that sparked the idea that would become Toaster Defense: Mario Bros. Yes, that old arcade game triggered something in my brain. \"What if I\u00a0made it a small map like Mario Bros, and I\u00a0put something at the bottom of the map to protect like a tower defense game? It can be a game that mixes platforming and tower defense mechanics! That's pretty unique!\", I thought to myself. From there the idea continued to develop\u00a0 and Toaster Defense evolved into what it is today!</p>\n\n<p><em>Find a larger version of the game screenshots and character images in the press folder (below)\u00a0for you to use!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T17:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34d/34df0f4dcd1890dcb9f8ec3007ce5c7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woots"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
