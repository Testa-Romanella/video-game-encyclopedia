In the game, you have to run and collect different foods, some of them a healthy and some of them are not(like junk food). with the food, you are increasing or decreasing your calories, for example, if you eat healthy food your calories will drop with the number of calories that the certain food contains if you collect junk food the calories will increase. All of the food contains calories from real life. Also, when you run continuously you are losing some amount of calories. If you collect a lot of junk food and hit a certain number of calories you will become fat, but don't worry you have the chance to lose the fat shape and return to your normal shape if you eat healthy fruits. Anyway if you ignore this, at a certain point you will be too fat to continue running and the game will over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T05:56:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba02f9d2f3ac7626b206ac0522dcaeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simeon Vasilev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
