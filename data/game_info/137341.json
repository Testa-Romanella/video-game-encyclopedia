Two buttons control how and when spells are cast, the left and right mouse buttons. When you press a button, you start charging a spell. When you release that button, you cast either a basic spell or charge spell. If you hold both buttons, you set up a combo spell that is released when you release both buttons. (This last part hasn\u2019t been implemented as intended. \u201cCombo\u201d spell is used by pressing and releasing the mouse wheel) You use these spells to kill ghosts as you transverse the dungeon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e5860a6c54b39530ad56c08670876e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lance Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
