In a full game there would be more obstacles and puzzles, and more locations. I would also consider \"collecting\" each family member individually, and making a chain/trail of peas that would needed to be moved around safely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Horseflesh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
