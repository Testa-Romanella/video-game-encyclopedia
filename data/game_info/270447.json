It's up to Azre and Mavis, special agents from S.P.E.C.T.E.R to steal them back. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>But wait! They can't just go through the front gate with everyone watching, time to find another way in.</strong></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game is a tiny game\u00a0because I wanted to try out what being in a game jam felt like despite my stuffed schedule. I would say it would fit in nicely as an introductory segment of a longer game. I wished I could make it longer, but, this is all I could manage in a month lol! At the end, I did enjoy the experience of a game jam, it was worth it. ^.^<br/></p>\n<p>It has 3 puzzles for you to beat, taking around roughly 5-10 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Comments and suggestions are appreciated! <br/>If there are any bugs or errors do notify me about it.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This is set in a world that me and my buddy, Aeal are working on. I'm planning to make an actual game with it in the future. But for now if you are interested in finding out more about that setting, you can check out more lore bits on our group page: https://www.deviantart.com/trinity-log<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c60bd97d8ce4cf68f5582b79b4f03f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dragoonwys"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
