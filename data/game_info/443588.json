And more than that, he even got himself a beautiful girlfriend recently! But everything in his life will take a 180 degree turn once he gets to know his girlfriend's twin sister, the school's number 1 slut! How will he deal with the shock, and with the strange attraction he feels towards her...? Angel or devil, model student or bitch gyaru...? It's your choice! Political drama and hilarious hijinks alike are assured in this erotic comedy. Will this upright young man be able to remain pure among the sea of temptations he will face ...? Who are we kidding, of course he won't!\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Twin Maniax!</strong>\u00a0is an ambitious large-scale project, that will become the second game produced by yours truly. As always, here at\u00a0<strong>Lemon Mint Soft</strong>, we favor consistent storytelling over anything else, so the gameplay once again will be that of a\u00a0<em>visual novel</em>, with few, but very important choices.\u00a0It's as much of a comedy as it is a porn game, so I hope that you are in the mood for some fun! Sentimental struggles, and even bigger things will be on the line, but the mood will always be kept light-hearted, and somewhat silly. I sincerely hope it is to your liking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5975a62f22933f88200b5b81cda6ca93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lemon Mint Soft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
