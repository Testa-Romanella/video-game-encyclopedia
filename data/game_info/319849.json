The objective of the game is to reach the Pharaoh's chamber to defeat a final boss.</p>\n<p>Firstly, players enter a dungeon and try to advance as far as possible through the pyramid map. They will enter different rooms, 3v3 combat rooms, Duel rooms, reward rooms and heal rooms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While battling, they have the option to challenge enemies to a duel, a 1v1 combat, that, if victorious, will result in an ability and stat absorption to level-up his characters.</p>\n<p>When players die, a shop will open with different abilities to buy, unlock and equip to their characters. When those are chosen, they will enter the dungeon again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/22527ab7c83be11d1fa8138aa8240cd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thunder Pixel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
