{"id": 117462, "slug": "fish-eat-fish-world", "name": "Fish Eat Fish World", "name_original": "Fish Eat Fish World", "description": "<p><strong>It's a fish eat fish world out there...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>...so you better\u00a0eat or<em> be eaten.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Eat fish smaller than you to grow, and rise to the top of the food chain while avoiding obstacles and those who might eat you in this underwater action game.\u00a0Complete with three challenging game modes, an endless mode just for fun.</p>\n<p>Other features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Animated sea creatures, with bubble trails and unique skeletons.</li><li>An upbeat nautical melody and chomping sound effects for when you eat fish.</li><li>High score and pause button.</li></ul>\n<p>The four game modes are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic</strong>: play as a little red fish in a fish eat fish world. Eat small fish to score points and grow, while avoiding puffer fish and any\u00a0fish larger than you; both\u00a0will kill you instantly.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: once you get the hang of classic, we introduce jellyfish and marine mines to avoid. Be careful!</li><li><strong>Puffer</strong>: play as a shark and eat puffer fish to score points and grow. They're edible while deflated, but will kill you when puffed up, so keep an eye out!</li><li><strong>Endless</strong>: play as a shark with the ability to eat everything, and without any way of dying, and <em>relax</em>. You will score points in this mode, but you won't grow.</li></ul>\n<p>Each mode has a 'how to play' page you can access by pressing the \"?\" icon next to each mode in the menu.</p>\n<p>Control your player by clicking and holding to make it swim in that direction. A short click will make the fish move just a little, and a longer hold will move it farther and faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At any point, you can press \"C\" to change the controls and make the fish follow your mouse cursor at a constant rate, with no clicking or holding needed. This is a little unwieldy and a bit more difficult, and is included mostly for players who find pressing and holding the mouse button to be uncomfortable and painful after a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Press \"M\" to pause the music, and \"N\" to turn off the noises that play when you eat a fish. Pressing their respective\u00a0keys will turn them back on, and can be done at any time.</p>\n<p>The escape key will take you back to the menu at any time, and the spacebar will pause your game.</p>\n<p>Feel free to e-mail\u00a0<strong>mxcaseydanger@gmail.com\u00a0</strong>at any time with bug reports, as well as any feedback, suggestions, or requests.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>The full game is being provided to you for free!</strong>\u00a0There is a suggested donation\u00a0of $10, and while you are not\u00a0<em>required</em>\u00a0to pay, we would definitely appreciate your support.

It's fully featured, bug-free, and\u00a0playable, but we had to put development on hold due to how much time and money it was taking to make. There's a lot more we wanted to do with it, but this was originally planned to be a small, short project, and exceeded our scope very quickly.</p>\n<p>If we do work on this game again, we may add in:</p>\n<ul><li>An options menu, with ways to control the volume or change controls.</li><li>A leaderboard, where players can compete and show off their high scores.</li><li>Animations for the marine mine, (we wanted it to explode and play a sound.)</li><li>Sound effects for when the player dies or is eaten.</li><li>Additional game modes.</li><li>Additional fish colors and designs.</li><li>Power ups that fall from above, and can be grabbed and activated by the player before it hits the ground.</li><li>Different backgrounds.</li><li>And much more!</li></ul>\n<p>We simply cannot afford to continue working on this game, since we are giving it away for free and it's already taken a few months. It was originally planned to take a week or two and have just one game mode and limited features.\u00a0We went as far as we could, and way farther than we should have.</p>\n<p>If this is one of your favorite games and you are dying for an update, an\u00a0<strong>email</strong>\u00a0is a good way to get our attention and share your ideas, and a\u00a0<strong>donation</strong>\u00a0is a good way to show that this game has people who still enjoy it and\u00a0help us afford\u00a0to take breaks from paid work in order to add onto\u00a0a free game.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Zapsplat for some of the chomping sound effects used!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbca4dd2034231aeaf5c7045a362903a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ca5ey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
