Navigate the pothole infested city and level up your car by destroying potholes with your laser beam. Gems can also be found scattered around the city which level you up faster.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Gas - W</p>\n<p>Reverse - S</p>\n<p>Left - A</p>\n<p>Right - D</p>\n<p>Flip Car - F</p>\n<p>Stuck - R</p>\n<p>Toggle Map - M</p>\n<p>Aim the laser with the cursor</p>\n<p>I'm 13 and I'm fairly new to unity so the game might be a bit clunky. I hope you find it fun because I spent my school break\u00a0coding and\u00a0building it. I'm very excited for the next Brackey's Game Jam. This is my first game jam and I had a lot of fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c62dc002dc336ac1d7b8a60acd90158a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bjamz"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
