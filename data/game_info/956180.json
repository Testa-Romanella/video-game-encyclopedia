I chose to create a game in virtual reality which delivered educational content in a more engaging, fun and interactive way.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I have always been interested in the <strong>virtual reality</strong> space and wanted to challenge myself further in my final year. My\u00a0daughter provided inspiration for the content of the game. She was sat at the dinner table doing her homework, her face gloomy with the odd \"tut\" here and there. Her task was to circle Even numbers upon an A4 piece of paper and another for Odd numbers.</p>\n<p>Some time passed and here is my prototype \"<strong>Whack 'A' Mole Mathematics VR</strong>\"<br/></p>\n<p>Choose from x2 game modes (<strong>Odds &amp; Evens</strong>)</p>\n<p>Gameplay: Evens</p>\n<p>With your hammers, whack the moles displaying an Even number. Hitting multiple correct moles will increase your multiplier and earn extra points. Check out your stats on the score board at the end of each game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T11:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb877f27f4ca364bc8c8b4d65cf6fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Regantha"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
