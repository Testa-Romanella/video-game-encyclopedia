I remember having so much fun playing those space shooters, despite their simplicity, so I tried to made something that resemble those aesthetics ^^'</p><p>However, the game is not pixel perfect. I tried to make the game more \"fluid\" and a just a little bit modern for high resolutions.</p><p>The game itself has very little story. You just must destroy the alien invasion with your spaceship\u00a0and grant Earth with momentary peace.</p>\n<p>There are 6 different stages with unique challenges and besides the default spaceship shot, there are more 3 sub-weapons that you can use.</p>\n<p>That's it!\u00a0</p><p>I hope you enjoy my first game :3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a80/a805ce418ec990ea91b46ed0a3d0a987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Raul Lessa"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
