It is a remaster of Worms 2: Armageddon.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is not much different from the other installments in the series. The game revolves around two opposite teams of worms that use everything in their power to eliminate each other.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the round, the worms spawn across the map. Each worm has a specific amount of health points. If a worm is attacked by an enemy, injures itself or falls down from high altitude, the health points are taken away. Health can be regenerated using medkits which are dropped down from the sky every several turns. Weapons and bonuses can also be picked up. </p>\n<p>The game is turn-based. During a turn, the player can move around the map, attack the enemy and so on. Each turn has a time limit. The player wins when the opposing team is killed and at least one friendly worm survives.</p>\n<p>The game features several game modes each with their own rules and differences. The players have the ability to create custom games. It is possible to make a completely new set of rules, pick a new map and other parameters in a custom game mode.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2010-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e411c02b4cd1fa35f77728268a36ff9.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/WormsTeam17", "rating": 3.66, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 69, "owned": 1740, "beaten": 64, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 107, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 184, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 185, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
