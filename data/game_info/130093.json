Weird right?</p>\n<p>I would suggest you to minimize the use of coffee and to not waste your precious energy on some typos. Just to be sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, don't forget to share your awesome articles on Twitter!</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours during Ludum Dare 39. It was my 3rd finished Ludum Dare game but it was the first time I attended on my own, and to be honest probably the one I enjoyed the most working on.</p>\n<p>I was not able to finish in 48 hours but I am more than very happy with the outcome :). \u00a0As always with Ludum Dare game there are a lot of things I am looking forward to improve in the next ones. This time it was mainly the audio part of the game. Hopefully it will be better next time :D</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy.</p>\n<p>P.S. There is ~10k words so happy typing :D<br/>P.S.S. There is only windows build right now, but I will most likely add others later today :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ac/4ac8bd693a1cdf490bd1d7514d070d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mato26"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
