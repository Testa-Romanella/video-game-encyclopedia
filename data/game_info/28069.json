{"id": 28069, "slug": "choice-of-the-star-captain", "name": "Choice of the Star Captain", "name_original": "Choice of the Star Captain", "description": "Fight on the front lines of the war between humanity and the hideous Blobs. (Not that anyone has actually seen a Blob up close, but everyone knows they have tentacles. Surely they\u2019re hideous!) Go on stealth missions, run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, \"aided\" by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon\u2019s gravity well.<br/>\r\nB) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he\u2019s so smart.<br/>\r\nC) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon\u2019s surface instead of attempting a risky escape.<br/>\r\nD) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd\u2019s screen with a torque wrench.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHumanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race? The choice is yours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cf/0cfaf8d5b6450367ba297326f8de4d55.jpg", "website": "https://www.choiceofgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Choice of Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choice of Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
