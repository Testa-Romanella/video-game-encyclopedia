Operating an excavator takes hand-eye coordination, three dimensional thinking, and planning. Think you've got what it takes? Select your route and how deep you want to go. Be careful not to dig yourself into trouble, and always remember, it\u2019s important to be efficient! Every block traveled and every scoop costs you Action Points. The less Action Points you use, the more stars you will get. Levels get more challenging as you go. Get three stars on all 25 levels to be a master excavator. Excavator lets you practice the skills needed to be a real life machine operator, right on your mobile device! There\u2019s work to do. Can you dig it?<br/><br/>Excavator was created for the Constructors Association of Western Pennsylvania and the Western Pennsylvania Operating Engineers Training &amp; Apprenticeship Program.
