It all starts when someone sends you a message from their friend&#39;s cell phone, asking for help to escape from a situation as complicated as it is obscure.  Among the many options, choose the ones that seem most appropriate and follow the course of history, guiding a complete stranger through underground tunnels.  Pass creatures capable of inspiring madness in the eyes of the beholder.  Choosing options can change not only the course of the game&#39;s story, but also who you are in it.  Look for the way out or get lost in the process.</p>\n<p>The game is short, but has several references inspired by the tales of HP Lovecraft.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>8 different possible endings (+1 secret ending), on intertwining paths.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>31 achievements that can be unlocked throughout the story.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>====OTHER GAMES IN THE SERIES======</p>\n<p>Did you think little?
