We decided to create severals mini-games, in order to make this reeducation easier, and bring a piece of happiness in the daily life of the patients.<br/>The aim is to suggest a set of mini-games which could be played with a myoelectric bracelet, able to feel contractions of the biceps and the triceps of the patient.</p>\n\r\nSe\u00efko<p>Se\u00efko is planned by our team as the introductory game to the principle of rehabilitation. The game is controlled only with simple biceps and triceps contractions, allowing the patient to begin to get used to the movements necessary for handling their future prosthesis.</p>\n<p>The player thus controls the trajectory of a falling star falling from the sky, moving it from right to left in order to avoid the branches in its path.</p>\n<p>Controls: Q: Left- D: Rgiht- M: On/Off Sound</p>\n<p>Project page :\u00a0https://playthesis.fr/Games/Se\u00efko.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d21130c5c44f8ea36a91cc8658cfe258.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magry Valentin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
