While it is unknown whether these objects exist in nature, nothing prevents us from investigating their properties and consequences with our computers. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRiemann\u2019s Lens is an interactive virtual art display that allows you to fly around and through a wormhole, with simple scenery rendered in the euclidean space on either end. The size and geometry of the wormhole can be adjusted. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustom scenery can be defined with a scripting language.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe simulation uses a compute shader to perform non-euclidean ray-tracing, and relies on the graphics card to perform some heavy computations. It has been developed on a machine with a GeForce GTX 1650, and it manages 2-5 fps. Expect some lag. The graphics card must support OpenGL 4.3+, and compute shaders. It did not run on an Nvidia Quadro K1100M (6 year old laptop).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(A Linux version exists, but I'm still working out the linking. Coming soon.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51d3280258afd540363329350c5d555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Schinder"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Schinder Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
