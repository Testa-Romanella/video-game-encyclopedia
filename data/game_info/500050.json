Includes Attack, Jump, Block, Crouch, Crouch Block, Death and Knockback abilities.</li><li><strong>Juice</strong>\u00a0: Game enhancing features like player dust for jumping and landing. Squashing and stretching of the player when jumping and landing, giving the game a better feel. Screenshake for hitting enemies, or making an impact.</li><li><strong>One Way Platforms</strong>\u00a0: Allows the player to drop through tiles, or jump up through them.</li><li><strong>Enemy Setup</strong>\u00a0: Simple enemy object which supports player block, knockback and attacks.</li><li><strong>Dual Controller and Keyboard support</strong>\u00a0: Both a controller and keyboard work as input, at the same time.</li><li><strong>Simple lighting system</strong>\u00a0: A light object can be used to give anything a nice radiant glow. Any colour can also be set.</li><li><strong>Smooth moving Camera system</strong>\u00a0: Can be used to follow any object, and offers various panning speeds.</li><li><strong>Room transition</strong>\u00a0: Allows a fade to black transition between rooms.</li><li><strong>Room Spawning System</strong>\u00a0: Multiple room spawning positions depending on room entrance.</li><li><strong>Lives and Damage System</strong>\u00a0: Entities can take multiple damage before being destroyed. Damage is shown in the GUI.</li><li><strong>Game End</strong>\u00a0: After all lives are lost, game returns to the Main Menu.</li><li><strong>Initialisation Room</strong>\u00a0: Allows for easy persistent object management.</li><li><strong>Template Parent Room</strong>\u00a0: Allows quick reproduction of room structures for faster level creation</li><li><strong>Fully Tiled Sample Room</strong>\u00a0: A completed room to demonstrate how to build your rooms correctly.</li><li><strong>Sound effects</strong> : Basic 8-bit sound effects are included</li><li><strong>YYC Compatible</strong> : Compiling in YYC allows for the most efficient and fastest build</li><li><strong>Documented Code</strong>\u00a0: All lines are commented as to their purpose, and the entire project has a complete write up to make understanding the engine as easy as possible.</li></ul>\n<p>Try the Windows Demo here.</p>\n<p><strong>Note\u00a0: </strong>Tile collisions are reliant on the size of the tiles and the size of the masks. This system is setup for 32 x 32 tiles and sprites. Other sizes will require changes to the code in order to work correctly.</p>\n<p>This package incorporates the use of graphics, which are free assets from external sources. The graphics are included, but these are free assets and are available below if needed\u00a0:</p>\n<p>* Tileset - https://www.openpixelproject.com<br/>* Main Character - https://itch.io/queue/c/686097/sano-214s-collection?game_id=444209<br/>* Background - https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background</p>\n<p>Lastly the graphics and player setup can easily be removed so you can use the collision and platform system as the basis for your own projects, and instructions are provided outlining how to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Hope you can make a cool game using this asset.\u00a0 All the best!</p>\n<p>Peter Morgan aka Slyddar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/2314f74d909873e01933aa78820ca960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Morgan"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
