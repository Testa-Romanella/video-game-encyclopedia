Bask in its cuteness. Listen to it sing for you. Love it. \u00a0Kiss its little head.<br/>Now it is time to care for them. They eat plants, have babies, and only die if they get too hungry. Should be easy, right?<br/><br/>Set plant number, critter number, and cannibalism at the start then watch your critters go. Plants slowly regrow over time. If the number of critters reaches 0 then the PhD ends. <br/><br/>Critters have a grub stage and an adult stage. Adults will pass each other and interact (small heart). If they like each other enough then they might have a baby (big heart).<br/><br/>What was that about being sponsored by a shady organisation? I'm sure it's nothing to worry about...<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f46b2befda3e479664a40c4678d337ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flat White Canvas", "Laurence-Cullen", "Michael-Negus", "erubywinter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
