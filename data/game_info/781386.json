You play as a worm, who is hungry for apples. Swipe up and down to collect apples with letters that belong in the word. Spell a word correctly to fill your hunger bar with 1 apple. Incorrect letters remove half an apple from the hunger bar, eventually ending the level if it reaches 0. The level is completed once the apple hunger bar is filled. Progress through 6 different levels, with gradually increasing scroll speed and word length.</p>\n<p>Developed by a team of five from Chapman University.</p>\n<p>- Joshua Yang</p>\n<p>- Sevan\u00a0Levonian</p>\n<p>- Dominic Castaneda</p>\n<p>- Jaewon Park</p>\n<p>- Kenneth Cho<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e348d87d6435025a3467fa5f89283f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Josh", "jaewonjpark", "kecho", "dominic-castaneda"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
