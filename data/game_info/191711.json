Untextured and inefficient, but works! WASD moves you like a shooter, up/down/left/right moves you like a dungeon crawler, which was the original idea I was aiming for</p><p><strong>Color Wizard</strong> - 30% of a roguelike. Numpad moves around, click 'spellbutton' in the bottom-right corner to select a spell, then click a target to execute it. Bumping monsters kills them. Different monsters have different AI. Using the 'omnisight' spell reveals my pretty cool dungeon generation algorithm.</p><p><strong>Breakowt </strong>- 10% of a physics-based breakout game. I had big plans for this but gave up after realizing that there's a hundred thousand better breakout games. The ball bounces using Box2D physics though, which was going to be the cool part.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19ab56a8077028500e03f2b66a3027e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benamas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
