Hope that everyone will enjoy my game :)</p>\n<p>This is an action game. You play as a new grim reaper. Your boss wants to know your capabilities, so he put your ability to a test. In this test, you have to collect as many souls as possible before the time runs out. However, your love and mercy are dragging you back. The more love you have, the slower your soul-harvesting is. You can even fail the trial because of love!</p>\r\nGame Goal:\r\n<ul><li>Harvest as many souls as possible.</li><li>Earn as much score as possible.</li><li>Don\u2019t let your love and mercy hold your back!</li></ul>\n<strong>Control:</strong>\n<ul><li>Use\u00a0<strong>\u201cW\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cS\u201d, \u201cD\u201d</strong>\u00a0to move around.</li><li>Use\u00a0<strong>\u201cLeft mouse button\u201d</strong>\u00a0to harvest souls.</li></ul>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul><li>Use\u00a0<strong>\u201c\u2191\u201d, \u201c\u2190\u201d, \u201c\u2193\u201d, \u201c\u2192\u201d</strong>\u00a0to move around.</li><li>Use\u00a0<strong>\u201cLeft ctrl\u201d</strong>\u00a0to harvest souls.</li></ul>\r\nUsed tools:\r\nGame Engine\r\n<ul><li>Unity</li></ul>\r\nVersion Control\r\n<ul><li>Git Kraken</li><li>SourceTree</li></ul>\r\nChart\r\n<ul><li>Coggle</li><li>Draw.io</li></ul>\n<p>Most of the resources of models (modular assets) come from the online resource, but I use them to design the level in the game.
