{"id": 929161, "slug": "a-lizards-life", "name": "A Lizard's Life", "name_original": "A Lizard's Life", "description": "<p>The basic idea of the game was that you were going to be a normal person that ends up becoming cursed one way or another. Once you are cursed, you become a lizard, and you must survive underground, which is much different to what you have ever known. There would be enemies down there and eventually new friends that you could find on your journey. Unfortunately, there was no way I\u00a0was ever going to complete everything I made plans for in a week, so this is the result/prototype that I\u00a0have to show for a week's worth of work. It is nothing impressive by any\u00a0means, but I would say it is a good step in the right\u00a0direction. It is only my second game, so oh well.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T07:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/188c8b7065954683f5bc2ce2bdb14990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danny_Phantom3"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
