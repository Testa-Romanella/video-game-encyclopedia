I've put off uploading this for some time since it's unfinished, but the source code was lost so it will\u00a0\u00a0(likely) never get finished. Things to take note of:</p>\n<ul><li>You can move with WASD, and clicking throws an axe (costs essence).</li><li>Komiko Units (Costs 20 Essence) cannot be placed closed together.</li><li>Sales cannot be canceled, if you click a tower, you HAVE to place it.</li><li>The game is not endless, and the final wave (15) is DIFFICULT.</li><li>Unfortunately, the game force closes when you die :(</li></ul>\n<p>These are all things that would have been fixed or changed in a final version, but we may never see that. Regardless, I hope you all enjoy this micro tower defense!! I made this, art programming and all,\u00a0start to finish in only a single night. I am very proud of it^^ Enjoy :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/4583977511f7e53f8644d689fdea5850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nyanko Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
