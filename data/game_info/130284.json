I knew an NGO \u00a0was invited to present their cause, so I went to the jam with the goal of developing a game (digital or analog) that would solve a problem they had. After Hope Now's lecture, I decided to make an analog game, a low-cost game that could raise awareness towards the NGO's cause and that could at the same time be easily accessible in poor countries if the production cost (0.50 cent to 2.5 Euro, or 2 to 10 Danish Crowns per unit) is sponsored.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/23809a649271ad872eb6632c33a05968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amazu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
