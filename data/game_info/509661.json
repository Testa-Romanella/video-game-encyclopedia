However, in its journey\u00a0 the ship began experiencing unexpected maintenance issues and \u00a0was forced to evacuate, shooting your crew to the closest planet. You have landed with nothing but your crew and will need to begin gathering resources to ensure your survival.<br/></p>\n<p>You will need to set up camp and set up a research station to collectively pull together your knowledge in order to transform your gathered resources in the tools and weapons needed to survive. The members of your crew will serve as your primary resource, and under your management, will gain the essential skills needed in order to survive.</p>\n<p>But be careful, as you are not the only prisoner crew that was evacuated from that ship and there are sure to be other groups just like yours. Some good, some bad, but that is up for you to decide.<br/></p>\n<p>The success or failure of your crew depends on the appropriate management of the risks ahead of you in deciding whether to settle on this planet, or return home.</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Procedural Generated Worlds</li><li>Ability to manage your survivors the way you want</li><li>Progress through different levels of technology</li><li>Randomly occurring events</li><li>Base Building</li><li>Combat</li></ul>\r\nALPHA ACCESS\r\n<p>The game is currently in an early Alpha stage meaning there will be plenty of bugs and potential crashes.
