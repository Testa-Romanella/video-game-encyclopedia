{"id": 675155, "slug": "snake3", "name": "Snake\u00b3", "name_original": "Snake\u00b3", "description": "<p>Snake is a classic video game. Part of the reason that it's such a classic is no doubt it's simplicity: Press a button to go in that direction, get the dots, don't run into anything. Simple. Anyone can pick it up and play it. So, naturally, I thought\u00a0\"What if we made this needlessly complicated?\"</p>\r\nEnter\u00a0Snake\u00b3,\r\n<p>(or Snake Cubed), a game that takes the classic game of Snake and adds a third dimension. I wanted to add some <em>depth</em> to the game, so now instead of only being able to move left, right, forward, and backward, you can also move up and down.\u00a0And if you need a better view, you can rotate the scene around.</p>\n<p>Other than that, it's pretty much just a classic game of Snake. I hope you'll enjoy it!</p>\n<p>This game will remain free (at least, the core game will), and all I ask in return is that you maybe check out some of my other games, like Dimenshift.</p>\r\nFuture Updates:\r\n<p>Very soon I hope to update the game with controls for mobile, and the ability to customize a game (the level size, difficulty, etc.).</p>\n<p>After that, I'll work on getting leaderboards implemented.</p>\n<p>Then I'll consider this game complete. If I feel like it I might consider adding a multiplayer mode, and/or maybe some different game modes or level shapes.</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Pay attention to the shadows! They'll help orient you.</li><li>If your view gets blocked, rotate the level around.</li><li>I find it more comfy to play with a controller.</li><li>If you play on a controller, the right stick can be used sort of like the arrow keys in-game.</li></ul>\n\n<p>(There seems to be an issue with the itch.io desktop app installing the Linux version of this. You can get it to work if you just download it through a browser.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9bae2b84bcca33681f5c8c55f20fb149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Detective Software Devs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
