The game switches controls every 8 seconds, where you control the outer blocks instead.</p><p>This is an early build of the game, no scores or penalties are available atm. Just a tech-demo, well, sort of.<br/></p><p>The game was build with Adobe AIR, making it available for browsers, mobile devices, desktops and TVs. This is currently an Android version.</p><p>More to come in the nearest future!
