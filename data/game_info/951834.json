Devour! Take their weapon and become stronger and stronger.</p>\n<p>Climb to the top of the tower and take back what was once\u00a0yours.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The game currently only has several enemies and 1 boss. Around 12 weapons and a tons of upgrade. Gameplay is around 15 min - 2 hour depending on how you fair with the current boss.</p>\n<p>There's no way to save the game as of the current version. You have to go through the tutorial everytime you start a new game (As a roguelite, there's no game over so you don't have to worry much about this.)</p>\n<p># Note 1: Pressing quit game in the browser kills the game. You need to press F5 to reload the game again.</p>\n<p># Note 2: There's a weird antialiasing bug causing the game to look glitchy on the web, highly recomend downloading the game.</p>\n<p>Credit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>BGM:</p>\n<p>Tallbeard Studios:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/tallbeard</p>\n<p>SuloSounds:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/sulosounds</p>\n<p>Everything else was made by me.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-04T00:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/70182fefc1919361d29b1c59f67d9716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Meikumo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
