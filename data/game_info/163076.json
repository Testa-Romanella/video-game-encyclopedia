Unity Ascension is a multiplayer online platform shooter. I was able to finish most of the game: I had an ending I was very please with planed, but ran out of time... making online games is really hard!</p>\r\nThis game is defunct!\r\n<p><strong>The server is no longer running and so you will not be able to play.
