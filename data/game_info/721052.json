{"id": 721052, "slug": "nested-rooms", "name": "Nested Rooms", "name_original": "Nested Rooms", "description": "Nested Rooms is an experimental project to make a first person 3D non-euclidean experience. The game takes place in a few small buildings that contain more rooms than is logically possible. Game-play consists of navigating the non-intuitive spatial mapping while trying to find and complete tasks to progress to the next level. So its basically a maze except more complicated. In fact, one of the levels was specifically designed to be just a maze.<br/><br/>This game and all its assets were made single-handedly by someone with no prior commercial game development or graphical design experience. You will probably find this reflected in the quality of the game.<br/><br/>The core component of this game is that you can loop round to the same point in co-ordinate space and end up in a different room. This allows several rooms to coexist in the same spatial area independently of one another and makes for some confusing navigation.<h3>This game features:</h3><ul><li>Textures<br/></li><li>3D models<br/></li><li>Sound effects<br/></li><li>Coding<br/></li><li>Buttons<br/></li><li>Text<br/></li><li>Windows<br/></li><li>Doors<br/></li><li>A ceiling fan<br/></li><li>Three different levels/buildings that have the 'nested rooms' effect<br/></li><li>A painting of duck</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T03:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad8/ad89ac125c4fa50be4efc9b1d961605b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blaise Radcliffe"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Blaise Radcliffe"], "esrb_rating": null}
