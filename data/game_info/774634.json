But lately she has been making gross orange jam, that your cat tummy can't have. When you tried to knock over the citrus-filled cauldron to make room for delicious berries, it caused an explosive magical reaction, sending you flying out of your witches mage tower! With just one jar full of your beloved berry jam that you swiped on the way out, survive the fall for as long as possible, using your finite amount of jam to get you out of potentially sticky situations in a pinch.</p>\r\nMove L-RA + D or Arrow KeysFire JamSpacebar\r\n<p>Here is my first ever game, as my\u00a0entry for my first ever game jam, Mini Jam 104! The theme was \"Cascade\" and the limitation was \"Finite Quantity\". I've written a dev log with some more of my thoughts, but overall I'm quite impressed with how it turned out! I wanted to keep the scope small, use the \"Cascade\" theme with a liquid that wasn't water (jam felt fitting for my first game jam!) and create an interesting player-influenced difficulty with a limited resource with which to save yourself from oncoming obstacles. There are definitely things I want to improve and/or add, but nevertheless I am happy to have created a functional game in just 72 hours.</p>\n<p>Everything you see and hear was made by me.</p>\n<p>Some SFX samples sourced from Pixabay</p>\n<p>And a huge shout-out to Joel for helping me through some goofy little bugs in my code along the way &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T23:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/647ca1d884b8589d36b76311550f4795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["antlerdads"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
