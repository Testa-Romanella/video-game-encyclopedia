Also, the more you keep the space key pressed, the more you channel your jump, so you press more, you jump more.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and if you send us a screenshoot with the end of the game, you will get the updated versions before we will release 'em! :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T08:24:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e98fce98b2c6e73f5dc17da1c44827d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sapphire Devils"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
