The Triangles, with their acute angles and superior structural integrity, have held sway over the polygonal world for centuries, enforcing their laws with an iron fist and stamping out any who dared to resist. But the Squares, with their right angles\u00a0and easily calculatable area, have always chafed under the Triangles rule. They have sought to overthrow their oppressors and establish a more just and equitable society.\r\n</p>\n<p>The rebellion against the Triangle Empire has taken many forms over the years, from peaceful protests to violent uprisings. But nothing has ever truly threatened the Triangle's grip on power - until now. The current Square leader, a fierce and determined warrior, has rallied their people to a new cause: to storm the Triangle's stronghold and take down the tyrant at its head. The fate of the polygonal world hangs in the balance.\r\n</p>\n<p>You, as a player, take on the role of this Square warrior, charging headlong into the heart of the Triangle's power to challenge its leader and bring about a new era of freedom and equality. But the path ahead is perilous and fraught with danger. The Triangle's defenses are formidable, and the bullets it spews forth like a deadly rain threaten to destroy you at every turn. Your only hope is to navigate the gauntlet of death and emerge victorious on the other side. Will you succeed where so many others have failed? Only time will tell in POLY-BLITz: A Minimalist Bullet Hell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T16:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9cdde81963cfe4debdd394f0006eb2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SHMORGUS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
