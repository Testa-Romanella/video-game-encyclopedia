You are yourself, creating imagery by exploring Plato\u2019s cave. Be part of the infinite process of creation. Your acts of wandering and watching become the source of the artwork. The deeper you descend into a far, dreamlike state, more cryptic entities emerge.</p>\n<p>To win, surprise yourself. Inspiration exists, but it has to find you dancing with your controller. You have to <em>move playfully</em> to create appealing and mesmerizing pictures and moods. To win, do not seek. Find. Lift up your state of mind. Out of confusion, as the way is, and the wonder, out of the chaos would come bliss.<br/></p>\n<p>AENTITY is about the ultimate goal, getting free. All forms of control subject us to memory. A controlled mind can never act freely or spontaneously. To win, request the overstrained mind to go in the background for a while, just be aware of the fact of your existence without wanting to change it.</p>\n<p>Someone in wonder watching its art is the aim and the end.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cPretty radical for videogames in 2018.
