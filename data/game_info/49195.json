Welcome to Fractus! Blast your way through waves of organisms to release the portal to the next level, where you can do it all again! There is an infinite number of levels, but things get difficult quickly. How far can you get?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFractus is an abstract twin stick shooter for Windows and Linux. It is a unique visual experience and a challenging game. Most of the graphics are fractal objects that are procedurally generated on the GPU. It also features a snazzy particle dynamics system, and an odd medley of guitar-generated sound effects.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRequires a twin stick controller, e.g. a USB Xbox controller or similar.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60cf5f4c234f29c623ffb9af6a20a41b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Jeff Apostolos"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
