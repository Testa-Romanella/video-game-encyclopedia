As a cyborg programmed to eradicate the last remains of humanity, your sole purpose is to well... <strong>annihilate anything that moves</strong>.<br/><br/>So grab your weapon of choice (from chainsaw, through shotgun, to grenade launcher) and kill your way through underground hideouts, post-apocalyptic cities, jungles and more. And if you're feeling creative, there are plenty other ways of ending your enemies' misery - hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same.<br/><br/>If kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, <strong>BUTCHER</strong> is THE game for you.<br/><br/>(header photo by Bart\u0142omiej T.
