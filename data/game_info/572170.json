The numbers are stacked against you: outnumbered and outgunned, you must rely on stealth and cunning to accomplish your objective.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong> - When guards are\u00a0alerted, they cannot be sneaked up on. Stay out of sight until the situation has calmed down. Do not feel pressured to act prematurely: your target is not going anywhere (if not spooked). Scout the area, know your exit routes and guard locations and come up with a plan to get your target in a favorable position.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> - This game makes use of Kenney's assets, many thanks for releasing such a versatile asset pack for free.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/734a37cfa3e1f1de0507198627b731af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xenonghost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
