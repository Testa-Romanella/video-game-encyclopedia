End the war. </p>\n<p>The AI were trained using Machine Learning methods. Some of them learn from you as you fight them. You'll have to stay on your toes to defeat them.</p>\n<p>Warning - This is a prototype. Artwork is whatever I could find for free. There is no main menu. There is a tutorial but it is not all-encompassing. The combat is fun but can be glitchy. Improvements are required and planned. You MAY fall off the edge if you try to. If you die or defeat the final boss there's no end screen, so just quit using Alt + F4.</p>\n<p>The title is a reference to the Pinnacle by Kansas. </p>\n<p>Game music</p>\n<p>- Death Is Just Another Path by Otto Halm\u00e9n</p>\n<p>- \"Chase\" by Filip Przybycie\u0144</p>\n\n<p>Game developed by Divij Sood (Design and Programming) at Abertay University.</p>\n\n<p>www.dyonisian.com</p>\n<p>DyonisianDesign@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c84ec3732a125298dbfe8fafc7a0e27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dyonisian"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
