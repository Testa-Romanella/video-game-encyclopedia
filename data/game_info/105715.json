Be a green ink boy or a purple ink girl and fight till\u00a0death victory by painting as many things as you can! Who will win the ink war?</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>ZX Splatoon</strong>\u00a0 was originally\u00a0made\u00a0 for the <strong>Demake Jam</strong>. Before the jam even existed, I had made a mockup of a fake<strong> ZX Spectrum</strong> Splatoon (which you can check (along other awesome things)\u00a0on my Twitter @Zushi3DHero!!)\u00a0so when I found out about the Jam, I had to bring the mockup to life! It was a good challenge, since the ZX Spectrum had a bunch of limitations (the color clash situation, the resolution (which I doubled), the limited space for controls...) but I was able to make something decent out of it.</p>\n<p>The game offers an easy and straight forward single player mode, where you have to collect\u00a0<em>Lightinfish</em> and avoid the mean\u00a0<em>Octodudes</em>! Apologies in advance if you find a lot of bugs on the One Player Mode, I did it on the last day of the jam because I wanted to offer an experience to those who can't play with other people!</p>\n<p>And what is Splatoon without a local multiplayer mode? <strong>ZX Spectoon</strong> also offers you the chance to battle against someone else for 3 minutes! Paint the grey colored items as many time as you can so you can collect points and come out victorious!</p><p>If you are going to leave feedback, I am totally okay with that! :)</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game and thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>- Zushi</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>A game by:</p>\n<p>Zushi3DHero - Programming, Art, Design, SFX (Twitter: @Zushi3DHero)</p>\n<p>Simon \"Zebu\"\u00a0Gigant\u00a0- Music (Twitter: @ZebuZombie)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c2525a52ffde0cd2f7bba9ea0d89a10c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zushi3DHero"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
