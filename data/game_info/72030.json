It is also known as Bacon in other English-speaking countries. The object of the game is for a partnership to win at least three tricks. If the side that selected trump fails to get three tricks, it is said to be \u201ceuchred\u201d. Winning all five tricks is called a \u201cmarch\u201d.<br/><br/>Paired up into teams of two, each player receives 5 cards. The trump suit is determined through a bidding phase before each round. The Makers are the partnership who selected the trump suit and must win more tricks than the Defenders. <br/><br/>Players are required to follow suit after the leading card has been played. The player who played the highest value card of the suit that was lead will collect the trick. Points are awarded after each round based on which partnership won more tricks.<br/><br/>When one or more cards of the trump suit are in a trick, the highest trump suit card will win the trick. The team who reaches 10 points first win the game.<br/><br/>EUCHRE TERMINOLOGY<br/><br/>\u2022 Bowers: the highest cards in the suit<br/>\u2022 Defenders: the partnership that did not order the trump<br/>\u2022 Euchre(d): when a player calls trump and fails to get three tricks<br/>\u2022 Eldest Hand (AKA 1st Seat): opponent to the left of the dealer<br/>\u2022 Hand: a hand consists of five tricks (when all cards from the deal have been played)<br/>\u2022 Kitty: the four cards left over after the deal<br/>\u2022 Makers: the partnership that ordered the trump<br/>\u2022 March: calling and getting all five tricks<br/>\u2022 Order Up: declaring the trump suit<br/>\u2022 Pone (AKA 3rd Seat): the opponent to the right of the dealer<br/>\u2022 Singleton: a lone card of any given suit, when no other cards of that suit are held in your hand<br/>\u2022 Stick the Dealer: a game option that forces the dealer to declare the trump suit if all other players pass in the 2nd round of bidding<br/>\u2022 Trick: all four cards played by each player<br/>\u2022 Trump: the suit that outranks all other suits<br/>\u2022 Turn-card (AKA Up-Card): the top card from the kitty which has been turned face up<br/><br/>TIPS<br/><br/>\u2022 Lead with a singleton off-suit whenever possible. If no other cards of that suit are in your hand, the probability of your opponents having them is higher which prevents them from trumping your ace. Your best shot for having an ace make it around the table and winning a trick is on the opening lead. <br/>\u2022 Don\u2019t always count on your partner for at least one trick. Doing so can end up backfiring and getting you euchred! <br/>\u2022 Keep track of the cards played. While it\u2019s important to pay attention to your own cards, keeping an eye on what cards have been played by your opponent's is just as important to see how it will affect the outcome of the game. <br/><br/>SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK<br/><br/>If you have any technical problems, please email us directly at uv-support@magmic.com. <br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>FAN PAGES<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook!<br/>www.twitter.com/magmic<br/>www.facebook.com/magmic", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T00:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10f9a9ea7142ca313595bf362968bd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Magmic"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Magmic"], "esrb_rating": null}
