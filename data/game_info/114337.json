This is the first game I've submitted to a game jam, so I hope ya'll like it. In this game, you play as an undercover cop who travels through time and collects ancient artifacts to discover the truth behind the mystery of Gazoolgo.<br/></p><p>Okay, no, you don't do any of that. You're a desert bus (100) and you have to collect (100) candies before the evil Emperor Zoltar blows you up with meteors or blasts you away with lasers. </p><p>With the believable premise taken care of, the controls are simple: </p><p>W-S : Move Forward/Backward</p><p>A-D: Turn Left/Right</p><p>R/F: Respawn (if knocked over)</p><p>And that's it! With this knowledge in hand, venture forth and collect all of the candy for yourself! You selfish desert bus, you.</p><p>----------</p><p>Or better yet, don't be a selfish desert bus and head on over to desertbus.org and chip in a dollar or two if you can afford it! Good luck to the desert bussers!</p><p>----------</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Caxt Nova : (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuMkQ0ssyBBMJFIBq... | discord: CaxtNova#6287 | imaginarygamestudios.com ) programming, design, art, audio design, visionary, petter of dogs (and cats, if they allow it)</p><p>Penandum : (twitter.com/penandum | discord: penandum #5393 | https://penandum.itch.io/a-hallows-evening ) programming, design, music, audio design, pro Genji player</p><p>Talon : Emperor Zoltar portrait, original ramp texture (deprecated)</p><p>Feel free to contact me with any comments or questions!
