When I started, I knew\u00a0absolutely nothing about coding,\r\nmodeling, animation ... in fact nothing, I was just a player (not\r\neven a modder).\r\nThis partly explains that some aspects are poorly mastered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, the development of the\r\ngame is suspended (except some adjustments depending on your\u00a0feedbacks)\r\n<em>for\r\ntwo reasons. Firstly because to reach a really satisfying result,\r\nthere is still a lot of work that I do not feel the courage to\r\naccomplish (In short, the \"first game syndrome\") and\r\nsecondly becouse <strong>I have some other projects</strong>\u00a0(like this one for exemple)\u00a0that I would like to work on</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Now what I'm looking for is\r\nhaving enough feedback to engage a dialogue (either in substance or\u00a0form) and to learn from you\r\nthings that could help me in my future projects. Or, who knows,\r\nregain\u00a0the\r\ntaste and energy to put in place the thousand ideas I have in mind to\r\ndiversify the game\u00a0situations on this one.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa848e289115a41eaf17dfadd1f97f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liven"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
