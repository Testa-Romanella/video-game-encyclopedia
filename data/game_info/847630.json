The theme was \u00abAs Above So Below\u00bb and the limitation we've decided to apply is \u00abUse it or Lose it\u00bb the main point of which is to use only one texture map at once.\r\n\r\nAbout Limitation\r\nWe put all of our sprites on one list and created a material that scales to specific square on UV. Prepared models for each of every possible sprite. Background was cut into few pieces in order to fit the rest of the texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow us on twitter!\u00a0\r\nhttps://twitter.com/Zander__Games", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T16:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c8ef9fa2ff7488ccbd169c9f13e71e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zander_Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
