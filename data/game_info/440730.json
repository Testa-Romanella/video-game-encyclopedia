It makes the v002 seem barren by comparison!</p><p>Audio Warp contains 3 Visualizers and a few tracks from local Chico artists. To load your own music, copy your MP3's into here:</p>\n<p>(Game Directory) -&gt; Audio Warp -&gt; Content -&gt; NonAssets</p>\n<p>When you see the existing MP3's, you'll know you're in the correct directory. It should work with most MP3's, but be aware that some strange encoding might crash the app.</p>\n<p>To start the Visualizer, point your right hand at the menu in your left hand. Click on a Visualizer in the scrollbox on the Left. Then add music to it by clicking on a tape on the Right. Make sure both are bright, the button can be unresponsive (bug).\u00a0Then click Play. You can change the tracks and visuals at any time, but both will restart each time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surrogate's website is:\u00a0https://www.surrogatemusic.com</p>\n<p>Team Shark Week dissolved as a band in 2015.
