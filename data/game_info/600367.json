Your only objective is to dodge traffic.\u00a0I made this in my Game Design class I took in my junior year of high school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ChaseR took inspiration from endless runners, like <em>Subway Surfers</em>, <em>Sonic Dash</em>, and <em>Temple Run</em> that I played when I was younger. Being a fan of racing games, I decided to combine the two into an \"infinite racer\". Development began on February 21st, 2021 and ended on March 4th, 2021.\u00a0</p><p>The name \"ChaseR\" comes from a mistake I made in the title screen. While the other letters are about the same size and share the same color palette, the \"R\" is just red and slanted a bit. I was annoyed at first, but then I realized the R looked pretty cool, so I left it in there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/126b28648e0166a34568eeafa48104c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pytholge"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
