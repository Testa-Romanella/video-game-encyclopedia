I\u00a0recommend doing this when it's not overlapping another object.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc9c</strong> Toggling the grid button makes it so that objects will snap to the background grid. I\u00a0recommend having it checked when placing floors, walls, and borders and then clicking it off when placing furniture.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc9c</strong> To download a screenshot of your build, press the save icon.
