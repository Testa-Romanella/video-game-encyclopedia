As the solar system is dynamic one must be cautious and try to wait for the moment your planet and your destination get as close as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat sets this project apart?<br/>\r\n\t- Indie development<br/>\r\n\t- Gameplay across an entire solar system (generated procedurally)<br/>\r\n\t- Sort of 16 bit Arcade style but in 3D.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2 types of games modes, time attack and story mode.<br/>\r\n\u2022\tIn time attack you will challenge yourself to explore all planets as quick as possible.<br/>\r\n\u2022\tIn story mode you will find a new friend that will help you revealing mysteries around you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nImportant regarding gameplay:<br/>\r\nR.A.F.A. is really simple, one button to shoot and one to jump....and if you maintain the jump for a while you will activate the jetpack.<br/>\r\nThere are some tutorial messages right before the action starts but If you have a fast computer maybe you wont see it ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/26698a140ec4731a37530569493a33de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cristian Villalba"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cristian Villalba"], "esrb_rating": null}
