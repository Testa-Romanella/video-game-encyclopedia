{"id": 979155, "slug": "millennia", "name": "Millennia", "name_original": "Millennia", "description": "Create your own nation in Millennia, a historical turn-based 4X game that challenges your strategic prowess across 10,000 years of history, from the dawn of humanity to our possible futures.  Set the course of history and experience different timelines in every playthrough as you write an epic story through your actions.  Lead your people through times of crisis and ages of discovery, face great challenges and opportunities, and build a civilization that prospers through the ages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dictate the course of history across ten ages, from the first cities to space travel.  Accomplish certain objectives and you can move time into a Variant Age - an alternate history with new rules, new technologies, and new units.  But beware Crisis Ages; following a path of chaos and disorder may plunge the world into a future filled with war, sickness or ignorance.  Then again, a wise ruler can always turn a crisis into an opportunity....  Choose the path with care, as the ages you pass through will have a lasting impact on your people and the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Customize your nation by adopting unique Nations Spirits over the course of your game.  Will you be a nation of warriors or explorers?  Are your people lead by a Great Khan or a builder of monuments?  Are you known for defining  pop culture or for dominating global finance?  What parts of your culture will reverberate across history?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Manage your economy with care and create a juggernaut of growth and construction.  Start with basic resources to gain food, wealth, and production.  As your advance, decide how to best convert these simple goods into more valuable products through research and improvements.  Specialize your regions, turning iron into weapons or tools, wood into paper or lumber, gold into coin or jewelry.  Ship surplus goods where they are needed, allowing the breadbasket of your empire to feed far-flung colonies or your industrial heartland to supply troops near your enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pursue knowledge to research scientific and cultural advances, unlocking new units, buildings, and improvements to grow your cities or strengthen your armies.  Research Defense to train the first archers, Smelting to master iron production, or Guilds for making wine.  Variant and Crisis Ages feature unique alternatives, introducing everything from Cloud Estates in the Age of Aether to underwater cities in the Age of Utopia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Achieve your ultimate success through a Victory Age.  Toward the end of the game (or earlier if your strategy is sound), dominance allows a nation to dictate the winning conditions.  The rest of the world must decide if they will struggle to achieve victory before the leader ... or oppose the leader's attempt.  Risk everything to take victory in the Renaissance or carefully plan for triumph in the modern era.<h3>The Millennia: Premium Edition includes the following content:</h3><br/><strong>Wolfpack Warband &amp; Eagle Archers cosmetics</strong><br/>Elevate the presence of your units in Millennia with the exclusive Wolfpack Warband and Eagle Archers clothings.
