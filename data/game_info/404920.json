First ones change their rest length according to the neural network outputs.<br/>The others simply react to external forces to mantain their invariable rest lengths.<br/>From V6 there are \"muscles\". Muscle is an angle constrain between two links. The NN outputs determinate even the Angle that they must have.<br/>The Creature's Neural Network Inputs are: Vx,Vy &amp; \"Pressure\" of touching ground\u00a0 Points, Creature Rotation\u00a0 (DX and DY), Height from ground, X Y Velocities and Rotational Velocity.<br/>The Creature's Neural Network Outputs are: \"Intelligent\" springs rest lengths and Muscles rest angles.
