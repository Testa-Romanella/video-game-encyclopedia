The game was released for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64.</p>\n<p>The player acts as the ruler of a \"weyr\", a mountaintop redoubt where the people of the planet Pern raise dragons in order to protect against periodic invasions of deadly \"thread\" that falls from a nearby planet. The game is primarily a strategic one, in which the user attempts to form alliances, but it also includes an action portion where the player controls a dragon in an attempt to destroy falling thread.</p>\n<p>The game was one of several adaptations of the Pern story made in the 1983 time frame, which also included a board game and arcade game. This version, for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64, was considered a forerunner of similar games based on novels, although similar adaptations did not become common at the time. A sequel for the C64, Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern, was cancelled and not completed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da4234479a06906c2b51c190b71ba4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit"], "developers": ["The Connelley Group"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Epyx"], "esrb_rating": null}
