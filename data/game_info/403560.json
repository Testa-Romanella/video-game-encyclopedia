{"id": 403560, "slug": "youre-a-madman", "name": "You're a MADMAN!", "name_original": "You're a MADMAN!", "description": "<p>You're a MADMAN! is a game prototype I developed in my third year of University, for the brief \"create an addictive game mechanic\".</p>\n<p>This is another game idea that I had had for a long time but had yet to get around to working on. It was also my first attempt at developing for mobile using Unity, although the download here is only for the windows build.</p>\n<p>The premise of the game is you are a MADMAN! It's an on-rails shooter where you don't control the shooting, instead you are ALWAYS shooting. The goal is to avoid hitting the innocent people who have been tied to trolley carts, for fear of losing points, and therefore coins used to unlock new characters. You must instead hit the trolley carts that have dynamite on them. If they fail, the dynamite carts explode on the player and hurt them. The player controls the direciton they face using an on-screen joystick.</p>\n<p>There are also powerups that litter the paths the player travels along, but there are also powerdowns. These powerups and powerdowns have their own healthbars, so the player needs to be careful to avoid destroying the powerups but be attentive enough to destroy the powerdowns, to maximise their run.</p>\n<p>The game is pretty simple but that was the goal, as I wanted to create a casual mobile game rather than a more densely packed game, which I was already working on in Leeward. This project took around 3 and a half months to finish, whilst I was also working on Leeward and my Individual Research Project.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:04:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a5569fbebf691d632ccf896101e6b1d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Latchford"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
