Incomplete, rough but playable.<br/></p>\n<p>Zombies have infested the town that you love to terrorize. It's not procedurally generated large enough for all of you.</p>\n<p>The current goal in the Jam version is to seek out and kill all of the zombies. Zoom out and peek behind houses to find the last ones. The zombies like to hide in the houses. That's uh, emergent design, a feature, not a bug. Nope. </p>\n<p>As you get hit you start to fall apart and lose some abilities, but keep running! It was intended that you reassemble yourself but I didn't work the bugs out in the last hours. </p>\n<p>WASD = Move</p>\n<p>Left Mouse = Attack </p>\n<p>Right Mouse = Spin Attack </p>\n<p>Space = Create new level </p>\n<p>MouseWheel = zoom in/out </p>\n<p>Secret Debug keys: lots </p>\n<p>Unnecessary backstory: Your Frankengirl got home to see her house in flames (she just finished decorating), burned down by the villagers. She goes to the village to terrorize them but finds it crawling with all kinds of other monsters. That makes her doubly mad, that's her town to wreak havok in.
