This is the first time I use GameMaker and I only had two hours to learn it before the jam. So naturally, many things went wrong (I didn\u2019t even have the time to test it all together before I published). I will try to fix all the bugs one by one in sha\u2019 Allah.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD/Arrows to move.</p>\n<p>Use Space to interact with objects in your base.</p>\n<p>Use Enter to move between scenes.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>There are two scenes in the game; the first one is the house scene where you manage your resources and repair your wall, the second one is in the forest where you collect more resources and return to your home when you are done. You can move from the house scene, by pressing the Enter key, only after the night is over (when the enemies leave). You can move from the forest scene, by pressing the Enter key as well, whenever you have gathered enough resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs Fixed:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player\u2019s data is now accurately persistent and will no longer reset between scenes.</li><li>The Enter key will always switch scenes and will no longer ever restart the scene.</li><li>Enemies will no longer spawn after the day ends in the house scene.</li><li>The \u201citems in bag\u201d variable now updates the number of items correctly.</li><li>The player can no longer carry more than the maximum limit.</li><li>The catapult now shoots correctly, the damage and animation were not implemented though.(I intend to add these in a separate post-jam version in sha\u2019 Allah)</li><li>Added the game over screen (done after the jam just for the sake of clarification)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for all the creative artists who share their assets freely for indies such as my self.</p>\n<ul><li>Zabin, Daneeklu, Jetrel, Hyptosis, Redshrike, Bertram \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-tiles-cobble-stone-paths-town-objects</li><li>daneeklu \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-farming-tilesets-magic-animations-and-ui-elements</li><li>patvanmackelberg \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/tileset-minimal-style-8x8-based-with-characters-included</li><li>Sharm, William.Thompsonj \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-dungeon-elements</li><li>yd \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/catapult</li><li>DENZI \u2013&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/denzis-16x16-orthogonal-tilesets</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c23f6d442d485bf91b02cd91f515e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Furious_Witch"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
