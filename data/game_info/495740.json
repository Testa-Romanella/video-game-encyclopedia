Mobile controls are currently WIP but I\u00a0plan on releasing this on Android and iOS at a later date as well.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left Mouse: Acceleration</p>\n<p>Right Mouse:\u00a0Fire Weapons</p>\n<p>Spacebar:\u00a0Use Bomb</p>\n<p>F4 (in main menu):\u00a0Enter/Exit Fullscreen</p>\r\nOptions\r\n<p>Coming soon!
