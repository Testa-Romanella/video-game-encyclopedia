Choose from 16 historical or well-known \n      heroes, villains and fighters and battle your way to the top to become \n      the world's greatest warrior! There are two types of modes in this \n      version, \"Tournament of Titans Mode\", where you fight three bouts in one \n      day, and if you are successful you move on to the next day, and \"World \n      Heroes Training Mode\", where you can fight with any opponent. \n      Furthermore, the addition of dash and back step, which were not in the \n      previous version, as well as a countering system that ushers in a more \n      speedy way of fighting, makes World Heroes 2 Jet even more enjoyable to \n      play. There are also four competition types to choose from, allowing for \n      even more in-depth battles.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
