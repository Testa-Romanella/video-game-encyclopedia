To progress through the ages, you'll need to sacrifice your fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to sacrifice 100 lives to save you from the apocalypse your god will unleash on your town in 30 days, if he isn\u2019t satisfied.</p><p><strong>How to play ?<br/></strong></p><p><strong>1) Basics</strong></p><p>You must always have food to feed your population, so they can reproduce, or they'll <strong>starve to death</strong>.<br/></p><p>You can construct building by clicking the buttons on the right screen. The cost of each building is displayed at the top of this panel when selected.</p><p>Production buildings (ie. Mines, Fields or Sawmills) need worker in order to produce their goods, so be sure to assign them in the building's menu (click on the building to show it)</p><p>Your population is limited by the amount of houses you have. Be sure to build more houses or upgrade them to allow more people to live in your town.<br/></p><p><strong>2) Evolutions<br/></strong></p><p>The most important of your building is the <strong>Church</strong>. The level of the church will limit all the other buildings' level. To evolve it, you need to sacrifice some human live.</p><p>You need to have your church evolved all the way to level 3 to be able to make the ultimate sacrifice of 100 citizens, which will<strong> win you the game</strong>.</p><p><strong>3) The Apocalypse<br/></strong></p><p>You have 30 days to please your god by sacrificing 100 lives. If you don't make it in time, you'll lose the game.</p><p>If you find yourself short on time, but have some population to spare, you can sacrifice 5 of them in the <strong>Church</strong> for 10 hours of additional time.<br/></p><p><strong>4) Resources</strong></p><p>You have 4 kind of resources in the game :</p><ul><li>Population: your most precious asset ! Without them, you'd lose the game. Treat them nicely (you might need them for a sacrifice!)</li><li>Food: an essential resource. Without it your people will slowly starve and die.</li><li>Wood: used for constructing level 1 technology</li><li>Stone: used to upgrade your buildings</li></ul><p><strong>5) Buildings<br/></strong></p><p>You have several buildings at your disposal :<br/></p><ul><li>Church (already constructed): the place where you evolve and sacrifice people</li><li>Houses (50 wood) : housing for your people. Each house can hold 5 people (this can be upgraded)</li><li>Hunting Cabin(50 wood) : A great early game food source. The food income is regular.</li><li>Field (20 food) : A more efficient food source, but takes a long time to grow</li><li>Mine (100 wood) : A simple stone production building</li><li>Sawmill (50 wood) : A simple wood production building</li></ul><p><strong><br/>Good luck, and have fun.</strong><br/></p><p>credits :</p><p>development : Alexis \"Le Meilleur\"  Minotto and Sami Lefebvre.</p><p>music: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8dfde009c3d11fd11f374972487cf0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SamiSamiSami"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
