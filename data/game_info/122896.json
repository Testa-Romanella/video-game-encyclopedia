The game jam lasted one week and the theme was \"Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants.\" To be honest, I didn't really bother with the theme. Instead, I decided to create a prototype for a game that had been buzzing around my head for a while. </p><p>Everyone loves a good tower defense game... but <strong>what does it feel like to be the tower?</strong> In this third-person-shooter, you fend off hordes of robot troopers using only your sniper rifle and a few explosive barrels at your disposal. Please download the game for free from the Drive link below, and have fun!</p><p>If people really like this concept I may expand it into a full game one day. For now it's just a nice reminder of my first real Unreal (ha) project.</p><p>NOTE: Game begins immediately. Prepare yourself! Aim with your mouse, left click to shoot. That's it!</p><p><em>Frank DiCola is the creator and owner of this game.<br/></em><em>Special thanks to Adam Gincel for making the music at the eleventh hour!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/77466104fafe2f3cda91b9a5bda17764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yoshgunn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
