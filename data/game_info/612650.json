This game is still in development and will soon have more levels and better asthetics.</p><p>The credits for the music and some of the assets are\u00a0in the credits section in the game. I didn't realize I couldn't use outside music for my game, but its there.</p><p>Also, if you are on Lvl 3, push your player's body against the side of the platform outside of the visable screen\u00a0to go to him. He has vital information on a new way of jumping higher. You won't be able to complete lvl 5 unless you talk to him.</p><p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1deebfb98577007ad29c580f93c1de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MadMelon999"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
