Don't expect a story. Do expect action, gunplay, death and explosions. Lots and lots of explosions.<br/><br/><strong>The Jetboard</strong>: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and kick some serious alien butt. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.<br/><br/><strong>The Weapons</strong>: From the conventional (flamethrower, R.P.G., grenade launcher), to the ridiculous (gravity hammer, gamma ray, antimatter gun) and many more - Jetboard Joust offers a plethora of powerful weapons, each with its own upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake.<br/><br/><strong>The Enemies</strong>: A huge range of enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the above weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too...  <br/><br/><strong>The Bosses</strong>: Defeat huge bosses in a series of gruelling multi-stage battles. These guys will test your weapon-handling to its limits.  <br/><br/><strong>The Planets</strong>: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Unlock teleports and earn huge bonuses by clearing multiple levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T02:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8fb8d3db144e98939a037ba71c7f1de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 45, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BitBull"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BitBull"], "esrb_rating": null}
