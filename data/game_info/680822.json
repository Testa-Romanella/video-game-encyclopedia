I developed the game with the idea of having a simple game that I could play to relax, so please don't expect a competitive game :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's go to the game controls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left and Right Arrow: pirce movement</li>\n<li>Up Arrow: rotate pirce</li>\n<li>Down Arrow: accelerate piece drop</li>\n<li>Space: pause the game</li>\n<li>Esc: returns to title screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T06:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/944b0fc719374adcbb09fb0d1fac7e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Michell Stuttgart"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
