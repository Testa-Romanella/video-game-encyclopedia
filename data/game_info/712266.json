However,\r\nif you are stuck, there is a Hint feature built into the game. By selecting 2\r\ncards on the board, it will tell you which card is required to complete the group.\r\nThis can be very useful when you're first learning to game.\r\n</p>\n\r\nDiscarding 3 Cards\r\n<p>If you find yourself completely stuck, or just tired of the current cards,\r\nyou can discard 3 cards at random from the board and replace them with cards\r\nfrom the deck.\r\n</p>\n\r\nChallenge to Get 27 Groups\r\n<p>\r\n    Although there is no way to lose the game, it is possible to complete a full\r\n    27 groups. This requires a great amount of planning and luck. Can you finish\r\n    the deck without discarding any cards? Good luck!\r\n</p>\r\nTrijam #150\r\n<p>\r\n    This is my submission to Trijam #150. The theme was \"Grouping\". The goal is\r\n    to create a game in 3 hours. My final development time was 2:55. I hope you\r\n    enjoy this game.\r\n</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>\r\n    The source code is also available here: github.com/jcollard/trijam-150\r\n</p>\r\nAttributions\r\n<ul>\n<li>Music - Matthew Pablo</li>\n<li>Background Image - Paulina Riva</li>\n<li>Font - Alba by Fontalicious\r\n    </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddbf484374c148cbf01f323825a81948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jocolloman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
