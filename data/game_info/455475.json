This is a game made by IcebergLettuce (me) for the \"I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game\" Jam, hosted by Charlmes.</p>\n<p>In The Legend of Comfypants, you take control of a sentient pair of pants who wakes up in the woods, not knowing how they got there or why everyone is made of clothes. Explore the world in search of patches to continue your journey to find out who you are, and help some weird people out along the way! Roll yourself up to smash through obstacles and enemies and solve puzzles! You'll also encounter some... unusual areas along the way.</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS/WASD: Move</p>\n<p>Z/LEFT MOUSE BUTTON: Interact</p>\n<p>X/RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON: Roll</p>\n<p>F4: Fullscreen</p>\n<p>ESC: Exit to main menu/quit game</p>\n<p>My Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/iceberglettuce0</p>\n<p>My Twitter: https://twitter.com/iceberglettuce0</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking my project out, and have a great day, humans of the internet!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7f6f1f5fc4885eef5232d6a32177cba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IcebergLettuce"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
