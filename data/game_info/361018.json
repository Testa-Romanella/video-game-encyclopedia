The theme was \"<strong>Only One</strong>\" Only one what? Here, you play in <strong>only one</strong> destructible room and monsters try to enter. The more missed shots, the more holes you make in your room's walls, making it easier for monsters to penetrate. You will have to take care of your only one room, you lose when the room is not safe anymore.</p>\n<p>Use the arrows or WASD to move and jump (you can also use the spacebar to jump). Use your mouse to aim and left click to shoot.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, there are no music or sound effects for the moment in the game.</p>\n<p>Follow me on itch.io and/or on twitter @timkrief (where I post more regular updates and devlogs) to get news about the development of my games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c295567152a01b3efb39ba210f1c3acf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tim Krief"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
