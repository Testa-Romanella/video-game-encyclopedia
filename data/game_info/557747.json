No that's not a mistake, someone in the marketing department thought this was actually a good idea!<br/><br/>Untitled Puzzle Rhythm Game releases as the first ever game in the new URPG genre. A genre based on annoying the player and removing any sort of sanity through solving puzzles based on locality awareness mixed with keeping a \u2018simple\u2019 rhythm. It might sound easy, but believe us, it is much harder than it looks. <br/><br/>In this little story you play as the lead character \u201cBlob\u201d. Blob is a high profile DJ, playing to the biggest crowds, in the biggest of cities. But then one day he made a vital mistake and  didn't look both ways when crossing the road, and has now found himself in Rhythm Purgatory.<br/><br/>You must help him get up the stairway to heaven, as you slowly descend into madness... In the first every Untitled Rhythm Puzzle Game (URPG), will you be a winner or a loser in the way of the beat?<br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Play in the 50 level strong \u201cStory Mode\u201d. An unforgiving journey through some of the toughest levels ever created, of course after starting it off easy!<br/></li><li> Play in our open \u201cArcade Mode\u201d. A special area made up of fun challenges and unique game mechanics that are just TOO good for the Story Mode!<br/></li><li> Play in our \u201cEndless Mode\u201d.
