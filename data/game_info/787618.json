{"id": 787618, "slug": "maps-usa", "name": "Maps: U.S.A.", "name_original": "Maps: U.S.A.", "description": "Maps: U.S.A. is an educational game designed to teach the name, location, and capitol of all fifty states of the United States of America. Various difficulty settings and hints can be adjusted to accommodate those just learning, as well as those who already know the lay of the land. At game's end the player will either be rewarded with a stunning fireworks display and rousing anthem, or an invitation to play again until they can correctly identify all 50 states without a single misstep. An entertaining soundtrack keeps the mood light and the pressure low.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy wife and I homeschool our four children, and we designed Maps: U.S.A. for multiple reasons. For the younger kids, it made learning the state names and capitols entertaining. For the family as a whole, it served as an introduction to the world of software/game development. With the arrival of COVID in 2019, which forced many people into long periods of homeschooling and working remotely, we thought our little project could be beneficial to others. We hope your family enjoys playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T05:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f0d80b5b5e5edf81be4ea27e6524218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crandall Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Crandall Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
