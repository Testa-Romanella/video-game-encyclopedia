GO FORTH <strong>WARRIORS</strong>, AND <strong>FIGHT</strong>!<br/><br/>Alfelus is a modern indie game that attempts to recreate the fun of arcade classics from the 1980s. In the game, the titular hero must fight against an endless army of enemies, with nothing but his sword, his wits, magic artifacts, and up to 3 friends in cooperative multiplayer. Alfelus can move in eight individual directions using a controller or the keyboard, and Alfelus's sword can also in eight directions and is controlled separately from his movement. Additionally, the sword can be used for two Advanced Techniques. One of these techniques throws the sword like a boomerang and the other makes Alfelus perform a spinning attack. Several magical artifacts also appear, including magical potions which heal Alfelus, elemental gems which temporarily boost the Alfelus's abilities, a magical ring which temporarily allows Alfelus to heal when defeating enemy warriors, and a magical bomb that defeats all enemy warriors. The magic ring, the magic bomb, and each advanced technique can only be used once per battle, so the player must think strategically about their next action if they want to survive for long enough to obtain a high score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T03:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e36c6856b97443c719100df3141f4644.jpg", "website": "https://www.alfel.us/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MB Lev"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MB Lev"], "esrb_rating": null}
