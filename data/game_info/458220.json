This are the first levels of my game. You have to jump/fall into the blue complete pit. Then you completed the level. Now you're thinking: 'Easy game'. But don't hit the left side of 1 of the walls. If you hit the left side of 1 of the walls, you can retry, but you can also quit, but try it a few times first before you quit ;).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game! More levels later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:54:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae2ad9e3e353b1628dc0f7b4d997a1c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SnootyLeech0204"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
