I will update this with different modes later, but for now you just hop from lily pad to lily pad, gulping down any flies you can get your tongue around. In this version you go head to head with a cpu frog, first to 10 wins, but the desktop version will have a 2-player mode available. This version is mobile friendly with touch screen controls, but you can also use the arrow keys and spacebar as well as a gamepad.\u00a0Stay tuned for updates that will include sound and animated scenery, as well as upgrades and skins for your frog!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49a813938273741da18aff9d2500a873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["pattyorigami"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
