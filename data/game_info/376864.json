This Demo features Karen, a woman fighting her way through the hordes looking for the last known shipment of pumpkin spice coffee in the zombie apocalypse. The Demo in its current state is more geared towards combat mechanics than story or objectives, so anything involving level layout, story, objectives, etc are subject to change before full release. Any constructive criticism would be awesome!<br/></p>\n<p>Tested Specs:</p>\n<p>Minimum Requirements: Core 2 Quad Q6600 Overclocked to 3.0ghz, 4gb ddr3 ram, and a GTX 750ti; 1080p lowest settings preset @ 30fps</p>\n<p>Recommended Requirements: I5 2500k, R9 290x, 8gb ddr3 ram; Highest preset @ 60fps<br/></p>\n<p>*NOTE*</p>\n<p>Expect frames to drop with a lot of zombies on screen if you're using an older/less powerful CPU.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>-Sometimes when starting the game, the cursor is unlocked. You can just click anywhere and it should disappear unless you're in the pause menu.</p>\n<p>-Sometimes the game settings default to hard shadows, which causes strange looking shadows. Switching to soft shadows in the in-game options menu\u00a0fixes this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0caf5f218df58dc1cd47dcf3f19e6bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Single Dad Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
