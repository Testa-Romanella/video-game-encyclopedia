Plenty of others, but these are the best I've found thus far. You are appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong> Mouse and Keyboard.\u00a0 Point and <strong>click</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>ESC </strong>to Pause.\u00a0 (Sorry, no reloading). Try right-click, left-click, middle-click, scrollwheel, and dragging.</p>\n<p><strong>This is basically a joke mini-game with an intro sequence.</strong>\u00a0It's my first game jam game, and was built mainly to practice C# coding and utilization of my paid and free Unity assets.\u00a0 90% of time on visuals, sound, and intro sequence. 10% of time on gameplay. Lesson learned! <strong>More lessons learned: </strong>Coroutines can become confusing; Unity's Animation panel is pretty terrible; Sirenix Odin is well worth the money; sometimes you just have to restart the computer; a laptop without a graphics card is not great for 3D game development (duh-- it can't even run Crysis); exposing UnityEvents in the Inspector is pretty neat; sleep is NOT overrated; and more.</p>\n<p><strong>ATTRIBUTIONS:</strong> Sound effects obtained from soundfx.co.uk and zapsplat.com; some Creative Commons Zero.</p>\n<p>There's not a whole lot of original code here-- nor gameplay; it's pretty much just a mashup of paid and free Unity Asset Store assets, but the code that I have the right to share is up on GitHub. Using the source code as a project may not work very well (or at all) unless you install several of the assets I used. Here is a complete list:</p>\n<ul><li>PAID: Odin 1.0.5.3, Hierarchy PRO 2.2, TransformPro 1.3.2,</li><li>FREE TOOLS: MultiTags 2.1, Spawning Pool 1.0.1, iTween 2.0.8</li><li>FREE MATERIALS: Yughues Free Concrete Materials 1.0, Yughues Free Pavement Materials 1.0, Yughues Free Metal Materials 1.1</li><li>FREE 3D MODELS/PROPS/ENVIRONMENTS: Free Shipping Containers 2.0, Worldskies Free 1.0, Single Detailed Truck 1.0.2, Forklift 1.0, Realistic Cardboard Boxes (PBR, HQ) 1.0</li><li>ASSETS BY UNITY: Cinemachine 2.1.10, Default Playables 1.0, Unity Particle Pack 1.3, Post Processing Stack 1.0.4, TextMesh Pro 1.0.55.xx.0b12</li></ul>\n\n<p>Update: Post game jam version fixes several bugs.
