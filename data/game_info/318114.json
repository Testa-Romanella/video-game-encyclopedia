In commemoration of the spoiler ban lift of Avengers: Endgame (a great movie everyone should watch btw...) I decided to make a game about the experience of not watching a movie that all your friends have watched!! Hopefully I'm not the only one who had the painful experience of having to avoid friends/social media/significant others/living creatures to keep the movie fresh. Also, testing out a new art style inspired by Florence (a beautiful indie game)!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: This game <strong>does not</strong> have any spoilers for the movie! Rest safe!\u00a0</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/>You've accidentally overslept your showing of The End, the hot new movie everyone has watched except you. How will you avoid spoilers and foster relationships until you can afford your next showing?\u00a0</p>\n<p>'Back To Map' takes you to the channel where you can see all the possible locations where characters will appear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FEATURES:<br/>3 Different Endings! (for now)<br/>Many secrets to find ;)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd1a7fdae589e721dd833dcb99aa363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["chibixi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
