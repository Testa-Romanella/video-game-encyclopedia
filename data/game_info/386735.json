We were two programmers (@Alecsi_) and one artist (@Kowee11), who worked two days with minimum means (no game engine, only raw c++ and raylib) to challenge our skills and creativity !</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is simple : keep the library quiet as long as possible. Sometimes humans will laugh and make noise, and our little ghost must interact with the environment (E key)\u00a0 in order to scare them. Don't interact too much or you will freak people out and they could leave the library. Have fun !<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T03:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be64d03bb45fe2cf39365cb55c87e8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alecsis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
