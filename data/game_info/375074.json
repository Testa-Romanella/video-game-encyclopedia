Each player has 32 stones that have a dark side and a light side. While one player has its stones facing the dark side-up, the other player has its stones facing the light side up. Players take turn placing a stone in an empty space then flipping their opponent's stones to their assigned side. In order for a player to flip an opponent's stone, the player must place a stone where there are enemy stones in a straight line between another stone that belongs to the player. The game ends when a player has no available spaces to place a stone that flips their opponent's stone. The player with the most amount of stones on the board wins the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347c10e899714f70b0b3bf8687f1a3af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JayDiddyThaGOAT"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
