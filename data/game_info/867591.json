Made up of four areas, Gogum's Challenge is a 3D platformer with a unique twist. You have to beat the game in one run and if you die you are brought back to the very beginning. The four areas gradually get harder until you reach the final area. Do you have what it takes to become the Ultimate Gogum? Take the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>We greatly appreciate any and all feedback on the game. Thank you for playing and we hope to see you soon.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Slothclap</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236a61b833dc32fa77e82e54668a3a69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["slothclapstudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
