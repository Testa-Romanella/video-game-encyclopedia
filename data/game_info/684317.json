{"id": 684317, "slug": "aspirin", "name": "Aspirin", "name_original": "Aspirin", "description": "<p>No, this is not pacman.</p>\n<p>This is a video game that only exists (as far as I know) on the TI graphing calculators. This version I made is for PC. There are many enhancements to the game. You can run it at whatever resolution you want and there are monsters (pacman) (unlike the original). The graphics are very basic, but it\u2019s still fun.<br/></p>\n<p>It is an action/arcade type of game. The object of this game is to move your character (the yellow smiley face) around the screen to collect the balls. There are two balls appearing at a time. When you get one of them, you gain 1 point, and a horizontal arrow appears and keeps shooting in the same direction over and over. When you get the other ball, it\u2019s a vertical arrow. You will die if you are hit by the arrows. Occasionally, a pacman will come from the side of the screen and try to steal the balls from you. If he does, you lose 1 point. <em><strong>The pacmen do not kill you \u2013 they only steal the balls.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>You can find more details and versions on my website. . .</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>* If you scroll down on the right side pane of my website, you can send me a donation.
