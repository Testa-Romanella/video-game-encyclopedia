It was a pastiche of the old Fighting Fantasy books with with parodies of videogame tropes on top, and designed to have at least one small entry on each page, to get the reader flipping back and forth as they sauntered around the convention.</p>\n<p>In the end, not enough people contributed so the paper didn't happen that year, but I still wanted to get my stuff out there in some way and Twine was a great fit. The humour of the original content was stifled a little by the format, so I've expanded it out a bit, but a broad and directionless low fantasy parody with some gaming tropes thrown in doesn't really expand out too far!</p>\n<p>As the title suggests, hitting a dead end is part of the fun and to be expected, so if it happens, restart and make some different choices!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aea47dc22837c5e9b22e3bcc168efce1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TimeGentleman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
