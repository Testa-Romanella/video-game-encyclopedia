Made for My First Game Jam:\u00a0Summer 2020.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I\u00a0ran out of time. July has proved to be way more complicated and draining than I\u00a0had hoped, so I\u00a0scaled things down. Ideas for a few Tyranobuilder games have been put on the back burner, but I\u00a0really like this base concept.</p>\n<p>My execution of that concept, however,\u00a0 may leave much to be desired. Before moving on to new things, I\u00a0intend to rework this game's script, add at least one new room, and overhaul two existing rooms. After that, let the visual novels begin.</p>\n\n<p>- Chris</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/0703340b029059fddf95e3396c7ec179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HonestJuiceBox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
