You were told to sit there and wave at the people attending. However, people start throwing weird signs at you and you must do your best to mimic them... Because PR? I don't flipping know.</p><p>Anyways, if you don't match their signs they start to seriously dislike you, even going as far as hiring a sniper to take you out. That's a normal thing, right?</p><p>Also to make matters worse, your management doesn't trust you to keep waving at the folks, so they strapped a bomb to your chest which explodes if you don't. I'm pretty sure that's normal, as my team strapped one to me when making this game so I won't stop coding. That's not normal? SEND HELP!</p><p>Also we made this in like less than 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2017. Theme was \"Wave\". Just sayin'.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>Smack the Q, W, E, R, and Space buttons to control your sausage fingers.
