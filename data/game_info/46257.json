He is one of the Akasha\u2014 beings born from chaos, beings given form by chaos.<br/><br/><br/>After wandering\u2014 searching for nearly the past 200 years, the Dullahan has finally found Razuri, a 7-level labyrinth said to be the entrance to the realm of the witches, Hexennacht. Witches are the strongest beings, revered as Gods in the study of magic. It is known that they exist through the passing of tales and legends from one generation to the next, but only a handful is said to have encountered them.
