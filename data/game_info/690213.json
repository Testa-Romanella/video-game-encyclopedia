Press the DOWN key to move down and let go to move up. Don't touch any mines or the ground and don't let the torpedoes hit you!</p>\n<p>It is my FIRST game and I used Bolt with Unity. All art is my own and some of it I even like. But I am on the look out for an artist to help bring it all together.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback welcome!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ba/0ba0e5133bd831a6782383dceec3f2e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JaugerPlays"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
