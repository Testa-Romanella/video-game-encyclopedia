I'm mainly looking for feedback and helpful advice. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a 3D Pet training game with survival elements where you can collect, train, battle, trade any creatures you find. With your pet by your side you will have full control of them as well as yourself for any battles or other activities. You can build your own houses. This is just a prototype and will be updated with any major developments for testing. I want to show you can grow and build a game with the right community even if you learned nontraditional and little experience.\u00a0  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cfc5e56801f689a622cbfaac3238886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["AdNate88"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
