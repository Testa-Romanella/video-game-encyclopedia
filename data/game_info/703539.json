After playing at Abzu, the idea came to me to make this application with the assets I own from the asset store and put it on itch.io to have an easier access to the app from my work pc to my personal pc.</p>\n<p>Now if you want to use the app for you and leave it run feel free! I will update with more \"world\" once in a while (It will just depend on the assets I have).</p>\n\r\nSpacebar to jump to the next word\r\n<p>(but that's not the intended way to use the app, just a debug for me to check the words)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer 1</strong></p>\n<p>Eventhough spanish is in here already, the translations are not correct. If you want to help me translate the spanish words feel free to reach me out per email: antoinefauville@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer 2</strong></p>\n<p>I made this application only for the learning purpose.</p>\n<p>I was inspired by the abzu temples (video game) and made this application to have it run on my second monitor while I work so I can \"passively\" learn vocabulary.</p>\n<p>I used bought asset packs from the asset store. I have no intention to earn money from this application. I just used Itch.io as a web browser app host to have an easy access to my application.</p>\n<p>Any content that might refer to an other language learning application are pure coincidence or intentionaly parodied as a joke (such as the ricarduolingo birb).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/766/766b6b14a1b0041993eb4e1b64a91e07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Antoine Fauville"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
