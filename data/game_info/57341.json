Unlike the previously produced Double Dragon games, Techn\u014ds had little or no credited involvement in the development of the game outside of licensing the series' name to publisher Tradewest (the publisher of the first NES version of Double Dragon and the Super NES title Super Double Dragon). Instead, the game was developed by Leland Interactive Media, a subsidiary of Tradewest. Unlike the previous games, which were side-scrolling fighting action games or beat-em-ups, Shadow Falls is a head-to-head fighting game based on the animated Double Dragon TV series in the style of Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II. Techn\u014ds would eventually produce its own fighting game based on the Double Dragon movie the following year simply titled Double Dragon for the Neo Geo. Shadow Falls was originally released for the Super NES and Sega Genesis, and later released for the Atari Jaguar by Telegames (publisher of the Atari Lynx version of the first Double Dragon) in 1995.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-05T16:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/8572e7e332975652137278daa9f16975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Jaguar", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Telegames", "Leland Interactive Media"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Williams Entertainment", "Tradewest"], "esrb_rating": null}
