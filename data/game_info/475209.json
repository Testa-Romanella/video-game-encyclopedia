You lure them into traps and eat and eat and eat, your goal is to find a golden apple, can you find it?, it can be challenging.</p>\n\n<p>This game is originally based on a childhood favorite game that I played on my mom's mobile phone. Its a old 2d runner game, I finally decided to create my own one with a nice 3D Low Poly Environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note\u00a0: for anyone who might be hurt to bright or bloom effects, this game is set in a bright environment as you see in the screenshots. My little bro has this problem where he get headaches when he sees bright lights, noting it down here and also\u00a0read the \"Gameboard.txt\" for infos.<br/></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: the screenshots if you view them you might find them being too blurry or with bloom. In game its not like that. Its because of the software I used to take the screenshots.</em></strong></p>\n<p>P.S: Leave a comment about your experience\u00a0^_^, so I can Improve myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>(Sounds, Edited and Credits):</p>\n<p>Eating Apple Crunches by Koops is licensed under the Attribution License. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/> <br/> Wet Doodles by Martijn de Boer (NiGiD) (c) copyright 2019 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/NiGiD/60127 Ft: Javolenus<br/> <br/> Low Battery Blues by Martijn de Boer (NiGiD) (c) copyright 2014 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/NiGiD/48615 Ft: Javolenus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf59b09563bd91419d0469eae582fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shaanig01"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
