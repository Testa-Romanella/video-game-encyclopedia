What can we learn from it and will humanity be able to survive? Use the equipment fitted to your guided vessel to scan planets and keep your ship running.\u00a0 This is a short indie horror experience, it should take around 30 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>I have never made a game before this one, I am interested in game development and figured I would give it a try. I have crafted basically everything for this game except textures and music but all sound effects and models were made by me. Please keep this in mind as you play through and feel free to leave some feedback. I would be happy to fix any bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T04:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b2/5b2a477f282337634fd51afe94edaa3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GammaZed"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
