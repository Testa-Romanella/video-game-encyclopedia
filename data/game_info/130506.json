So I hope that you're also able to enjoy what is here.\r\n</p>|| CREDITS ||<p>\n<em>Character concept:</em> Woestijn - http://woestijn.deviantart.com/<em><br/>\r\n\tMusic:</em> Kevin Green - http://kevingreenmusic.com/<em><br/>\r\n\tGame Design/Development:</em> Swift Illusion - http://www.midnight-tinkering.com/ | https://twitter.com/Swift_Illusion<br/>\n</p>|| CHANGE LOG ||<p><em><strong>Update 1--</strong></em><br/>\n<strong>Added</strong>--<br/>Options to increase/decrease turn sensitivity and area based on feedback.<br/><strong>Changed</strong>--<br/>Large changes to overall balance/speed based on the above addition.<br/>Holding right mouse now doubles your turn speed instead of just turning you upwards.<br/>\n</p>|| ADDITIONAL NOTES ||<p>\r\n\tThis is a small submission for '1 game a month' jam, which is a revision of the Ludum Dare 38 submission that was left feature incomplete because of time lost to significant bugs/etc.<br/>\r\n\tEven though I only barely had the core experience available I enjoyed it enough that I wanted to finish up what I'd left out so hopefully some people can have fun with this full experience.<br/>\n<em>Also-I would have liked to build this for webgl but encountered errors regardless of the unity settings so it may be a version issue or a result of the visual programming tool I use, so I'm sorry for those who may not be able to try it as a result.</em><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/47467e250a20cd885b192626b3e599dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swift Illusion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
