The\r\ngroup struck a fatal blow against the villain\u2026 but not before a\r\nvile and powerful ritual was completed. The world died and millions\r\nof reanimated skeletons awoke without a master to serve.</p>\n<p>In the centuries since, a\r\nnew global society emerged\u2026 One without the need for food, water,\r\nmedicine, sleep, or even air. One that would not age, grow sick,\r\nsuffer poison, or experience pain. One lacking race, gender, sex,\r\nreproduction, responsibilities, or the threat of death. For many, it\r\nfeels like a utopia.</p>\n<p><strong>Player characters are\r\nmembers of the masterless race. They are sentient skeletons which do\r\nnot eat, drink, or breathe.</strong></p>\n<p><em>This is a draft. I'm looking for feedback.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd2db31f85e75c7534e38c9880033d87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jackrosetree"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
