No matter how many eggs you get from this caverns, a new road appears in front of you full of nice stuff to get...\u00a0 and dangerous enemies to fight. Will you be \"rough like a dragon\" to get all the possible eggs before you get hit?</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Endless game: </strong>the game ends when your skill betrays you. See how far can you go and how many eggs you're able to get in a single run.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenging random levels:</strong> each level you play will be completely different and random. A long jump at the beginning, three enemies looking for you, a trace of diamonds, anything could be waiting for you in the next stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple gameplay:</strong> forget the complicated games with 10 different mechanics in the tutorial. In Rough Like Dragon you can only move, jump and spit fire. You'll get the hang of it in matter of seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazing music:</strong>\u00a0 an excellent selection of music pieces under creative commons licence will be next to you in every single run.</p>\n<p><strong>Xbox controller support*:</strong> make your experience better playing with a xbox gamepad.</p>\n<p><strong>Historic data:</strong> want to know how many slimes you've killed? How many eggs you've got? Or simply how many runs have you spent in this game instead of studying?
