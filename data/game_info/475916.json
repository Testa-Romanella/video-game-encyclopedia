You play as Henry, a lonely man living on the outskirts of a small town. The world has been overrun by large canine-like creatures who stalk their prey at night and go dormant during the day. Henry has since spent his time alone, studying the creatures and has found that equipping them with a bell seemingly makes them timid whilst hunting. This allows for Henry to traverse the dangerous, society starved world much easier.\u00a0 Trudge through the silence in search of food and fuel, but listen for the faint ringing of bells or the haunting sounds of the ones who haven't yet been belled.\u00a0 https://www.patreon.com/bellsandwhistles</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e02747b9ed05f34e5f18d40dd835d9f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit_Soup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
