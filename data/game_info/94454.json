Grab the ball, dribble with one hand out the window until you scope your net, drift up, and score!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWant to score again? You'll have to team up with an opponent to do a dangerous high-speed high-five turnaround that leaves you both driving the opposite way. You'll have to high five a buddy after every time you score. Art imitates life.\r\n</p><p>Get six points to escape the Kasketball Court and live another day in the grey freedom-less future in which control is absolute and the foul stench of humanity is but an illness only the robotic-global-super-mega-brain can cure.</p><p>Have fun and play safe!</p><p><em>Note: To play this beautiful mess of a party game, you'll need four players with controllers. Also beer probably.</em></p><p><strong>So I need three friends? No online play?</strong></p><p>Yeah, sorry about that! This is just a simple game made in a week.</p><p><strong>So this is some kind of Rocket League ripoff?</strong><br/></p><p>Basically, but the true story is even sadder. We came up with this idea in response to a jam theme, completely unaware of Rocket League. It wasn't until we were almost done that we saw RL and realized: we're forever destined to play far-second fiddle to that awesome game.</p>Made during the MadJam Seven Day Unity Jam.<p>ThirtyThree Games (feat.
