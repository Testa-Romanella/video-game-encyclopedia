This is the first game I made with a dynamic lighting system, I\u00a0used GMS2's shaders and blend modes to give the game that sweet neon aesthetic.</p>\n<p>There is so much that I would like to add to this game but I felt this was a good place to stop for the jam.</p>\n<p>Coming in the future:<br/>- Redo to\u00a0the majority of the art (I spent so much time on the lighting system I barely\u00a0\u00a0had time to make the art)<br/>- Colorblind mode (The game is highly dependent on color so it only seems logical, until then: I am very\u00a0sorry)<br/>- Add extra levels and different areas</p>\n\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any kind of feedback either post it in the comments. all feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0cde6d8b95b697fddc3faa926631754.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoonMoth"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
