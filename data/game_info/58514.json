I found one that I enjoyed, but after playing it extensively I found it too easy to beat the computer every time. Suddenly the problem with pool hit me \u2014 when you play against a computer in a physics simulation, you're literally playing against a god... By which I mean, either the computer is going easy on you (for a reason), or it's playing a perfect game and taking all your money.<br/><br/>It dawned on me that if I wanted a good single player pool game, I'd have to make a new kind of pool \u2014 a variant that doesn't need a computer opponent, that's built around the notion of scoring and improving, of taking risks, and of presenting unique and interesting challenges.<br/><br/>Pocket-Run Pool is the game I came up with, I hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/>-zach", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T14:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/86423697578f724c644c3a0a5c5c9012.jpg", "website": "http://www.pocketrunpool.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zach Gage"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Zach Gage"], "esrb_rating": null}
