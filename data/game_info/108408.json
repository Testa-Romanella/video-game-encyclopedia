We (the player) are inside and have been infected, so we have a limited time to find out what is happening to us and how we can heal ourselves.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Mechanically we are faced with a game of mystery and puzzles in first person in which our greatest antagonist is the stage. We must solve the different enigmas that we are encountering, know our surroundings and the incident to be able to escape. In addition, this is a non-linear experience in which mysteries can be solved in different order and it is not necessary to get all the clues and information to be able to complete it successfully. Each player faces the experience differently.</p>\n<p>Language: Spanish.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button - interact / pick up item.</li><li>Right Mouse Button - cancel/close.</li><li>WASD - move around.</li><li>I - open inventory.</li><li>Ctrl - crouch.</li></ul>\n<p>Visit our web page:\u00a0http://madlab.webcindario.com/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6e00d447c609e87a8c636f753f411a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MadLab"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
