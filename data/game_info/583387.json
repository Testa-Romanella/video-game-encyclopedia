The only type of collectible that exists right now is a coin (fully animated), but the approach taken is in no way coupled to graphic.</li><li>Added a gradual, cohesive progression - the first two levels are very basic to introduce the separate mechanisms (shooting, and separately collecting) followed by a third level which combines the two and increases difficulty significantly.</li><li>Added goal display (enemies and coins remaining) so the player understands the objectives of the level, and what is remaining.</li><li>Added custom music to the third and final stage. This is music that I made in entirety.</li></ul>\n<p>Note for the MacOS X download, you must run two commands from the terminal on the\u00a0<strong>.app</strong>\u00a0file after extracting it from the\u00a0<strong>.zip\u00a0</strong>(at least this is the case if running Big Sur):\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>sudo chmod -R 755 MacOS.app</em>\n</li><li><em>sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine MacOS.app</em>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:47:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39d50d4e45e03c9326aa5f41bffc6e43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["acurtiz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
