To counteract this and bring it back to its old glory <strong>Satan himself</strong> started deploying some of his demons to cause global warming in the world above his domain. To generate the necessary heat, <strong>corpses</strong> of the damned are being <strong>burned\u00a0</strong>in the central <strong>incinerator</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>This would be business as usual - if not for the fact that all that's left of hell's great factory is a single lava hole in the middle of the icy wastes.</p>\n<p>Meet <strong>Smokes </strong>- hell's janitor. His job is cleaning up after new sinners are brought into the once fiery depths and making sure they're <strong>incinerated</strong> at all costs. He couldn't do this job reliably without his trusty <strong>shovel, </strong>which you can use to strike enemies and push around their leftovers.<br/></p>\n<p>During the regular waves <strong>banished souls</strong> (in the form of skulls) will spawn. Fend them off and <strong>push (or throw) their corpses into the central incinerator/lava hole to fill it up.</strong></p>\n<p>After enough corpses are burned, a frantic <strong>boss wave</strong> will begin - during which you can't dispose of corpses as the incinerator is closed and working. Try to avoid the masses of enemies and <strong>don't run out of space!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Vote for our game on the\u00a0</strong> </strong>Ludum Dare<strong> page!</strong></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>pm2k - Coding</p>\n<p>HappyHead - Art</p>\n<p>laight\u00a0- Music</p>\n<p>Sisi\u00a0- Cover art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba31d632f8ef82cefff98a306293d7e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HappyHead"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
