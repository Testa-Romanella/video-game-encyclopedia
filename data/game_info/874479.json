While it meets your expectations from an operating system to a certain extent with the applications it contains, CHAQS progresses in the direction of more challenges in terms of gameplay. Therefore, it meets the visual needs of the user with its graphical interface, but the terminal creates the entire game aspect of CHAQS. Although all of the terminal commands are written to meet gaming needs, some of them can operate outside of these needs. The prepared challenges do not fully reflect real-world ethical hacking, they are similar.<h3>Terminal</h3>Terminal is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for CHAQS.
