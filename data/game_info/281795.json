Big-hair bands, parachute pants, and leg warmers were all the rage.  Do you know what else was popular?  Video games that you couldn't beat!  That's right!  You could play some video games forever, if you had the right stuff.  The goal was to get the highest score amongst your friends, not finish the game.<br/><br/>Chopper Mission harkens back to the golden age of video games with retro graphics and game play.  Destroy enemy missiles, helicopters, and missile launchers as you rescue soldiers parachuting from the sky.  Level up by entering a portal that is guarded by a glowing, radioactive barrier.  How do you get past the barrier?  You'll have to figure that out, soldier.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e687a2db3238c590a152b2e86ed875a4_I5cir6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Larry Feldman"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Larry Feldman"], "esrb_rating": null}
