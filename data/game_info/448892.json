To increase your speed you need to feed wood into the engine, but remember that the train speed continuously decreases over time, so don't forget to fuel the engine.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to avoid running out of money you can build tents on top of each wagon by putting a piece of wood in each of the little flags on a roof. Put animals on the performance stands to gain more money. Once you unlock sheep, you can improve tents with cloth to maximise rewards.</p>\n<p>After each travel phase there is a performance phase, during which your animals will perform multiple times. At each performance, you will receive money! However, performing tires animals, so you must put them in the cage and feed them before they can perform again.</p>\n<p>At the end of each performance phase the shop area on top of the locomotive will be updated and you will be offered new machine blueprints and items that you can buy for different prices (based on the shop slot, not the machine or item type) and place in any of the randomly determined open machine slots on the train indicated by tools laying on the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Coop over the internet</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game does not support coop over the internet. But in testing we found that given a good internet connection our game runs well via\u00a0https://parsecgaming.com/.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nActionGamepad control\u00a0Keyboard controlJump\u00a0AUPInteract/pick up itemXEDashBSpaceThrowYWDropLeft Stick Down + YDown + WMove left/rightLeft StickLeft/RightEmote\u00a0Left BumperQNavigate menu\u00a0Dpad Up/DownUp/DownSelect menu entry\u00a0ASpaceDeselect character\u00a0BEscStart/Pause\u00a0 gameStartP", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccf4391f1c0c4fc5f111145b2c1d3458.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SillyGillyTeam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
