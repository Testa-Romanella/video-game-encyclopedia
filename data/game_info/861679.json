Every amount of money I will gain, will be used for game development, like to get new resources, make greater games and fund the 2.5D version (next update)! This (after Air Rider and Autumn) is one of my biggest project and\u00a0the more time passes the better the game becomes! I really hope you will find the time to play this game.\u00a0Thank you very much :)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T08:29:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd7e3237effd00aa7091a356c8795fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sai Yaku"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
