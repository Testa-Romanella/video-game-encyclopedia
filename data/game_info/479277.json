This is a game in the style of mario brothers but with a twist. You can shoot bullets but with limited ammo. Don't worry though, if you miss your shot you can always rewind so that the bullet comes back to you! This can also allow you to hit enemies!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This game is made to be quite difficult, however if you go into the settings there's a \"limitless mode\" which takes away the lives, making it less like the original mario brothers games, but much more playable :D</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to abstraction for some amazing music:\u00a0http://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/!</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Apologies if your cursor doesn't show up in the web version, mine does after the latest upload, however if yours does not, the windows download can be found bellow!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec71149aeecae5244fe2f7a40574d250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
