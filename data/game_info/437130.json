This was a mistake, but through play testing we found out that it actually helps make the game a little easier so we left it in as a game mechanic and designed a couple obsticles with that feature in mind. The wallslide does not require you to press the direction toward the wall to keep sliding. It will do it on it's own, and pressing a direction does not remove you from the wall . If no directions are being pressed when jump is pressed, you will perform a dismount. You must be pressing left or right BEFORE jump to get the wall jump properly. Wallsliding replenishes your jumps. <br/></p>\n<p>There are some difficult parts, however the levels can be beaten. <br/>Please leave a comment with at least the following information:<br/>1. End Stats: Points, Time, and Deaths<br/>2. What was your favorite level?<br/></p><p>The downloadable version runs more smoothly than the web version.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed playing please consider supporting more development by purchasing the downloadable version of the game. If you'd like to support further development, you can download the Windows copy for a measly $2. I'd love to devote much more time to creating more games that inspire others one day to do the same. And don't forget to check out our other games as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/885/885a52cd3fff97cc040b7ca41d51624b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Invade Tech Software"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
