A hard task to the game is getting to score equal to 1000 and it should be the main goal of the game. This game is an example of the capabilities of the game structure.</p>\n<p>This project aims to create a game engine to make easier the precess of game development using Pygame. One of the initial purposes of this game was to develop a simple engine for making easier the use of Pygame to build more complex games. Therefore, the main frame of the game was built flexible and could be adapted to multiple types of games. Balance and Pygin were born together in this repository, but then the engine grew and migrated to its own\u00a0repository.</p>\n<p>Game inspired on mobile game Duet.<br/></p>\r\nAuthors\r\n<ul><li>Carlos Matheus Barros da Silva (Shark)\u00a0-\u00a0CarlosMatheus</li><li>Eric Pereira Queiroz Moreira (Precioso)\u00a0-\u00a0ericpqmor</li><li>Igor Mour\u00e3o Ribeiro (Dono)\u00a0-\u00a0igor-ribeiiro</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9be/9beffb8565d7ba72d40b70e061c03ee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carlos Matheus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
