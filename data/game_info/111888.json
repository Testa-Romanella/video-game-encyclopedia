It will focus on the navigation of a seemingly abandoned but completely intact city, populated by symbiotic beings of men and machine and use sparse mythical narration to introduce the player piece by piece to the world they are navigating and closer to unraveling its secrets and history.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was developed as part of an adaptation course at the Cologne Game Lab.
