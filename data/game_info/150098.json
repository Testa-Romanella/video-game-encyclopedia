Our music guy dropped out so we used some of Andrew's old (great) unused music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06c8190ade0cf200e1306339a54fb028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["STVR"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
