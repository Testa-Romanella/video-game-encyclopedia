During this journey you will see various social and global problems. Your objective isn&#39;t to solve them all, just simply pay some attention.</p>\n<p>About a year ago we formed a team &quot;3j&quot;. The begining was slow, because we were extremly unorganized, but eventualy we learned to work together and this is our first team project. We wanted to bring you something unusual and original. I hope you will like it and give a thought about the things mentioned in game.</p>\n<p>Facts for the curious:</p>\n<p>This game is in Lithuanian , which is our mother tongue (don&#39;t worry there are english subtitles)<br />\nWe named ourselves 3j, because names of each of us start with J (Jurgis, Justinas and another Jurgis)<br />\nPoem at the end of the game was written by fourth developer Jonas (&quot;4j&quot; wouldn&#39;t that&#39;ve been cool), sadly almost at the begining of our project he left our team. That poem is about a nuclear explosion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T00:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69c05d6d5a09ab9388e1340781e8bdca.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/470487", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
