The randomly generated maps, turn-based combat, and grid-based movement make it a fun strategy game with lots of potential. It is a short adventure, taking around 30 minutes to complete, though it will be an enjoyable 30 minutes. The boss fights are a fun change up, and the music is pretty good also. (If I do say so myself)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23f/23fae3f105e1d393fd504102e292a019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Robbins"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
