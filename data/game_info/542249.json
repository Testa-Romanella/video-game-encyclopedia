And a rope.</strong>\u00a0</strong>A cow who takes freedom for granted. But he's just a cow, living in a deception set by the farm and corporation that exploits them, milk and body.</p>\n<p>Gordi <strong>Freecow represents every naive, innocent, powerless and overwhelmed person</strong> in the face of the dual parade of powers-that-be and emergent stupidity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This cow could be any of us. This cow could be your boss, your mother, or even your neighbor's garden gnome. <strong>This cow could be you!</strong>\u00a0Rope Cow, we await you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ROPE SWINGING</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Rope Cow is a handcrafted game dedicated to all swinging\u00a0rope and\u00a0grappling-hook fans out there. And to every cow lover that has existed.\u00a0And to all beefs as well, heck, why not!?</p>\n<p>Along the way, you'll help unfold\u00a0a story that unveils the\u00a0overwhelming illusion that our cow has been living in. But this realization brings us to\u00a0a more profound dilemma: <strong>are we cow, or are we swinger</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Featuring...</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Story\u00a0mode</li><li>Goals based stage game mode</li><li>Bespoke rope physics</li><li>Original hand drawn art and\u00a0soundtrack</li><li>Tons of humour and cows!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware requirements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Graphic card</strong>: Dedicated card (DirectX 10 or OpenGL 2\u00a0support,\u00a01GB VRAM)<br/><strong>System Memory</strong>: 4GB<br/><strong>CPU</strong>: PC 64bit or Mac<br/><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 7 or later,\u00a0Linux or Mac OSX<br/><strong>Disk Space</strong>: 450 MB</p>\n<p><strong>Input Methods</strong>:\u00a0Keyboard and Gamepad supported\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Language Support</strong></p>\n<p>Menu and subtitles are available on:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>English</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Russian</li><li>Galician</li><li>German (<em>machine translated</em>)</li><li>French (<em>machine translated</em>)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/6496476473e1a3229ced0abb16248dd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JJ Montes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
