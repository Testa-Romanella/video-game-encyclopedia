Why would the U.S. government hire him -- a dealer of high-end antiques -- to look into a foreign murder? Why does David Walker, a former Special Forces operative he meets in his travels, feel like someone Malachi\u2019s known all his life? And how come every time Malachi lets his guard down, someone tries to kill him?<br/><br/>Moebius: Empire Rising is a contemporary adventure that merges classic point-and-click puzzle solving with Jane Jensen\u2019s sophisticated storytelling. Travel the world using Malachi\u2019s unique deductive powers to analyze suspects, make historical connections, and uncover the truth behind a theory of space and time the government will defend at any cost.", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2014-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T09:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb8e03f32371cdb8d6c6c8b104b9fc3b.jpg", "website": "http://www.moebiusthegame.com", "rating": 2.45, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 254, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 509, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phoenix Online Studios", "Pinkerton Road"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phoenix Online Publishing", "Pinkerton Road"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
