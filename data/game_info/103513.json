The mini game demonstrates the\u00a0cultural phenomena of flipping the cup after drinking the Turkish\u00a0coffee for reading one's fortune from the coffee grounds. The game is developed for introducing this exotic coffee culture to the people who are not familiar with it. It aims to create a mouth watering affect on the player and make them curious about the actual physical experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After you play thorough the tasting, you will be rewarded\u00a0with a short personal note, if you choose and click on one of the appearing\u00a0silhouettes at the fortune telling part.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please make sure to keep the sound on; the game has music and sound effects.
