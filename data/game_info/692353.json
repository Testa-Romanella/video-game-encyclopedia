{"id": 692353, "slug": "definitely-poker", "name": "Definitely Poker", "name_original": "Definitely Poker", "description": "<p><em>Definitely Poker</em> is a card game 'definitely' similar to your average round of\u00a0video poker! You are tasked with forming better hands than the dealer to win by replacing your unwanted cards!<br/></p>\n<p>In this game's case however! The cards that are possible to be pulled from as your replacements are revealed to you ahead of time, and can even be manipulated to prevent the drawing of certain suits outright! Guaranteeing the quality of your hands if you're clever enough to follow along.</p>\n<p>There's also the added PRESSURE of a target goal of cash you have to reach within a certain number of rounds, health points to manage, cute girls to gaze upon (okay - ONE cute girl...). There are just a decent number of extra things to think about on top of the regular poker gameplay! I do hope you'll manage!!!</p>\n<p>This game essentially serves as sequel/remake to a previous work of mine: 'Probably Poker'. That game was still one of my early ones, so looking back - it is a bit overly simple and uninteresting to a point. Therefore! I have gone and made something I can deem to be 'more interesting'! What do you think?<br/></p>\n<p>The cool folk involved in this one are:</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Himadri</strong> for the general art and UI/UX design!</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 hyamara</strong> for the CUTE GIRL/DEALER CHARACTER associated art!<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Random-storykeeper</strong>\u00a0for the music!</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Able Kirby</strong> for the sound effects! <br/></p>\n<p>YellowAfterLife for the Custom Cursor / HTML Loading Screen Game Maker extensions!<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n    aaaand globalstats.io for the servers and API used for the online scoreboard!
