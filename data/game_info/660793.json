In addition, there's also two set of movement key for each player, one of them controls the Pacman during his journey in the grid and the other controls the pinball pad movement.</p>\n<p>The goal is to survive longer than the other player, every time you failed to catch the Pacman, run out of action time, colliding with ghost without a buff, colliding with bullets and other will deplete your health. You can also collect the point inside the Pacman grid to restore your health and bullets, successfully catch Pacman from other player also restore healths and bullets. At the same time, the Pacman points will make your Pacman moves faster which means it'll become really hard to control as time progress.</p>\n<p>Everytime the game difficulty increase, the music will become more intense and there's a VFX indicating so along with a Pacman map refresh. There's also powerup inside the grid that will either kill a random ghost, make them invisible, make you strong enough to eat them or a random effect.</p>\n<p>It's best to experience it yourself! I have a blast playing this game with my friend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1</p>\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> to move the pinball pad</p>\n<p><strong>C, F, V, B</strong> to move the Pacman</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> to shoot pinball bullet</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> to shoot Pacman</p>\n\n<p>Player 2<strong>\u00a0 <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Up, Down, Left, Right</strong> to move the pinball pad</p>\n<p><strong>K, M, ,, .</strong> to move the Pacman</p>\n<p><strong>'</strong> to shoot pinball bullet</p>\n<p><strong>Enter</strong> to shoot Pacman</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong> Game idea inspired from Alpha Beta Gamer - Pacapong\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Desktop Version &amp; Source File</strong>: https://github.com/LeeTeng2001/Pac-Pin-Pong\r\n    <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T19:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab10b019a8ede006eaa677ca4d3f239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lunafreya2001"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
