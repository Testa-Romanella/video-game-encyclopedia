Every level has a staircase leading deeper. The further you go, the more enemies there are to challenge you.<br/><br/><br/>Gather money to trade with the Merchant -  he sells spellbooks and keys, which allow you to start from a corresponding type of dungeon. Merchant can be met randomly throughout your adventures.<br/><br/>Fight powerful bosses  - each for a given dungeon type, they spawn randomly below the first level of the dungeon. If you reach level 20 you'll meet The Bookkeeper. <br/><br/><br/>Dungeons are dangerous! Beware of traps and don't forget to find some food to survive in the depths.<br/><br/>Good luck young wizard. Make haste, the Bookkeeper must be stopped!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a092865ca8348e1c01885cb864c81d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jan Pielesiak"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Jan Pielesiak"], "esrb_rating": null}
