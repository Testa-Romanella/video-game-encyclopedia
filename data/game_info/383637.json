FPS trainers like Kovaak's are pretty good but quickly become boring and repetitive. 2d games like osu! are amazing but have limited content. BeatAim has been developed over last 2-3 years in my free time. After testing many solutions I've finally found perfect one. Not only it is possible to open <strong>any</strong> music but also to deeply <strong>customize map generation</strong>. Every gameplay new map is randomly created based on the song. This makes reflex more important than memory which is not the case in other rhythm games.<h3>Why?</h3>Hey, I'm Kamyker and here's how and why this game was created:<br/><br/>When I started playing BF4 competitively back in 2015 I was always looking for tools and ways to improve my aim. Anything I found was boring and I couldn't use if for more than few days. I started making my own trainer similar to osu but I wanted it work with any music and in 3d-space. At some point I quit my job as Game Developer (as company didn't want to give me a week off to attend lan event lol) and my esports career stopped so I decided to show BeatAim to the world. After fairly successful alpha and ~100 copies sold with almost no marketing it's time for Steam release.<h3>Features</h3>Slowly BeatAim is evolving from simple aim trainer to fully featured game:<br/><ul><li>4 targets types - simple click, slider (hold mouse button, tracking aim), slider with invisible path, WASD arrows (to prevent players from using keyboard to shoot)<br/></li><li>preconfigure maps - 7 music maps with 5 difficulties each, they work with rankings and has to be unlocked in progression system<br/></li><li>rankings - see how your skills are compared to other players<br/></li><li>tournaments - esports support with real prizing is also planned<br/></li><li>progression system - earn BeatCoins by playing the game and unlock new maps, guns and soon also skins<br/></li><li>daily quests - some items have to be crafted and require special materials that are available from daily quests<br/></li><li>battle pass - soon small battlepass will be available to everyone that bought the game <br/></li><li>referral system - if you are a creator you can easily earn premium ingame currency that in the future will be tradeable to Steam Wallet $</li></ul><br/>VIP Features<br/><ul><li>map generator - open any song (mp3, wav, ogg), configure 14+ parameters and create your favorite maps<br/></li><li>founder role on discord<br/></li><li>season battle passes - soon when bp are out vips will get them for free</li></ul><h3>Pricing</h3>You get 2 months of vip after buying the game for free. After that vip costs 5$ per month. Map generator is hosted in the cloud and that's a way of protecting and supporting it. You can also win vip in the tournaments or get it from your referrals.<h3>Future</h3>As I own this project it will get better infinitely. Right now it's only beginning... I have few ideas about new modes and multiplayer with one of the most unique way of playing fpses in history. Up to you if I'll be able to create it :)<h3>Trailer Music</h3>\"Collides Remix\" by\u00a0Dysfunction_AL<br/><br/>\"Dragon War\" by Makai Symphony<br/>\"Who We Are\" by Hans Atom<br/><br/>Video itself is:<br/>2019 - Licensed under<br/>Creative Commons<br/>Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T03:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb3861411e3bee2cdd96ee575ab877d.jpg", "website": "https://beataim.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kamyker"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kamyker"], "esrb_rating": null}
