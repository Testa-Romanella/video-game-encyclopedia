Admittedly it doesn't have\u00a0all 60\u00a0of the original levels, some of the in-game features, any sound, colour\u00a0graphics, and all the\u00a0rest, but it does take over 1100 times less memory to run!</p>\n<p>More details on\u00a0the original game can be found at the Electric Wolf website -\u00a0http://www.electric-wolf.co.uk/\u00a0- which also contains a link to the Xbox\u00a0marketplace where you can download the demo or full version of the game.</p>\n<p>Although\u00a0the game may look similar to <strong>Boulder Logic\u00a0</strong>released earlier in the\u00a0year, and indeed that supplied the starting code-base, the game logic\u00a0is very different - the boulders don't fall under gravity, but instead\u00a0roll in a preset compass direction - changing the game from an\u00a0against-the-clock arcade game into a crafty puzzler.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810552a7fac85a8c13d04950fe9c8bfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
