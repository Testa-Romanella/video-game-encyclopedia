There are some major differences, the main one being that you have to actually enter the word that you want to guess. This defeats the purpose of the game (unless it was two-player), but this project was mainly a challenge to see if I could remake the game that is currently sweeping the internet. I know there are some bugs and imperfections, but the game (usually) works, and for now that is what I am happy with.</p>\n<p>As I said, this game was mainly just a challenge to prove that I could make it. Oh yeah, it was also made in two days.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3a129f09805721845c2c72014c7b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RareChip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
