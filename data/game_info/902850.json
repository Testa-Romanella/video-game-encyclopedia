Your Turn To Draw - Death Game by Shadows - is a YTTD fangame where the fates of four characters are decided through cards and careful thinking, turning a harmless card game into a Death Game!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This game is also friendly to Yu-Gi-Oh! newcomers and those who know nothing about Your Turn To Die.</em></p>\n\r\nTHE FULL CHAPTER 1 PROLOGUE DEMO IS OUT RIGHT NOW!\r\n<p>The gameplay is fairly straightforward and linear due to many of YTTD's point-and-click exploration aspects being removed, as you follow the story of either one out of two protagonists\u2014Sou or Reko. Each character will have a different story route and will contain unique lore bits. The cards used by the protagonist will differ from character to character, and in case either of the two protagonists dies by any means, you may continue playing as their designated partner, though, you'll get a different ending depending on who survives.\u00a0The main gameplay will involve making the right set of choices, in either a card game duel against another NPC player or figuring out how to beat the death puzzle related to the story's card game.</p>\n<p><em>And in case you were wondering, yes, this is basically just Your Turn To Die if the death puzzles and main games were replaced with Duel Monsters.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The game uses a heavy amount of original lore points and off-canon content regarding the characters and the game's story, which also extends to using some popular ideas and scenarios from the fandom. This is mainly done to avoid majorly spoiling the original game to increase the scope of players, and it's also used to make an original and compelling story.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T13:20:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/948/948e26f84f71a6b42a9c389900a9c1f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EdgeRP"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
