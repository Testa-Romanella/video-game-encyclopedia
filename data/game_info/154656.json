The Berimbau is an African/Brazilian instrument. The assignment was to create a main menu and pause menu for a game, so I decided to set it in an African landscape. I created a map with water surroundings and huts for village people. Due to time restrictions I was unable to add many sounds, but the UI was the focus.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/233b035d7968cd1cfe634f4cd8a46775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Burt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
