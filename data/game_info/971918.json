What will their war set into motion?<br/><br/><h3>Ultimate Online Destruction</h3>Experience online PVP gameplay with block-by-block destruction. Take your loadout of battle-ready machines to Mars and use a variety of futuristic weaponry to dominate across different maps in quick play, ranked play and special events. Is your machine choice not working for you? Hold the ground, take to the air, or switch mid-combat to adjust to an ever-changing battlefield.<br/><br/>Even when your machine is down, continue the fight on foot equipped with the trusty QMG Assault Rifle. Powerful turrets and vehicles can be found throughout the maps: survive the machine-covered terrain long enough and use them to seek revenge!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using high-fidelity server-side physics means we can simulate every block on your vehicle; if you ram someone then destruction is shared between you and your enemy with extraordinary realism. Beyond destruction is the simulation of machines themselves: top-heavy constructions will fall over and heavy flying objects won\u2019t take off, but a well-engineered machine will reduce opposition to scrap.<h3>Endless options</h3>The Community Robot Factory features an almost endless number of machines to browse and download, created by our incredible community. Customise your choices, take them into battle and earn robits from playing to get more. With our current parts a skilled engineer can conquer the ground and sky and since new parts are released frequently, the possibilities to build and download will never stop evolving.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prefer to upload some instruments of destruction yourself? Earn notoriety and in-game currency from every machine uploaded and prove your building skills. Our construction systems allow for a multitude of shapes at any scale, giving engineers more control than ever before. Paint materials on individual blocks to define weight distribution, strength, and style and then use the RGB colour picker to paint it and make your machine look phenomenal.<br/><br/>A number of features are currently in development including a friends &amp; party system, hover blades and tank tracks.
