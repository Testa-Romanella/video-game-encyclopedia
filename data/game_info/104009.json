Many stars\u00a0and planets gather to eat galactic barbecue and have fun together. And this is your <em><strong>time to shine</strong></em>!</p>\n<p>You, <strong><em>the Sun</em></strong>, have been hired to take care of the galactic beef.\u00a0Cook\u00a0 them well with your <strong><em>sunbeams</em></strong>, but don't burn them! Don't even think on heating the cosmic ice creams, either! Remember: <strong><em>let the ice cream cool, and the meat warm</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> Good? Good.</p>\n<p>But don't think you'll be alone! You'll\u00a0have a <strong><em>helper saucer </em></strong>to catch the cooked food. If you let the food <strong><em>slip by</em></strong>, or <strong><em>ram</em></strong> into the Sun, you'll ruin the galactic luau, stars will be sad, and being sad totally doesn't go well with a luau. There's plenty of space in the universe, so work together and ensure you'll greet the visitors with flavors that are <strong><em>out of this world</em></strong>!</p>\n<p>(Bring your friend to play together! Or, if you feel <strong><em>beefy</em></strong>, try controlling the Sun and the saucer at the same time!)</p>\n<em>Controllers</em>\n<p>You can control the <strong><em>Sun</em></strong> with <strong>[WASD Keys] </strong>and the <strong><em>Saucer</em></strong> with <strong>[Arrow Keys]</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Joysticks</em></strong> are also supported! Use <strong>[</strong><strong>Joystick 1]</strong> for the <strong><em>Sun</em></strong> and <strong>[</strong><strong>Joystick 2]</strong>\u00a0for the <strong><em>Saucer</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>No spare joysticks? No sweat! <strong>Both players can share one joystick</strong>, too! Use the <strong>[</strong><strong>left stick]</strong>\u00a0to control the Sun and the <strong>[</strong><strong>right stick]</strong> to control the Saucer. So many options!</p>\n<p>Finally, Press <strong><em>F11 to toggle Fullscreen</em></strong>! After all, the universe is ever expanding...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d3f2065e4793c6ff681de48df8cc6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Novastrike Media"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
