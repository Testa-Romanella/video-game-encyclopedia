Most of it terrible but with more than a few seeds of interesting ideas. Packaged together in one handy download is a year of game development done with wild abandon. Some of these games were made in an hour, many in 3 hours, some even took a few weeks. This is an eclectic mix of game genres and themes that will hopefully give you some enjoyable moments along the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/77030243d8efaca5a328e55960dd1ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locked Door Puzzle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
