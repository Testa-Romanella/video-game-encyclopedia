Its a first person platformer inspired by tough as nails 2d platformers as well as other 3d games like Portal and the old school Tomb Raider games though with fewer puzzle elements.\u00a0 Feel free to critique it and leave some feedback about how the level feels. Currently just one level to test out teaching the mechanics. Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>A little about the world...</p>\n<p>It is a mysterious temple hidden deep in a jungle and you've been compelled to explore the it. Strange creatures inhabit the area and give you stories about their lives and why they are in this place as well. A large statue outside the temple has a strange presence and beckons you to uncover its meaning.</p>\n<p>Any donations are greatly appreciated and will help in developing the game, so if you like what you see consider supporting the game! :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d2865a4492e30911a8ae2ce01f07738e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CameronOtten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
