In this one- or two-player game, you \n      can play as Leila or Albatross-both characters from the original-as you \n      venture through several different levels, trying to put a stop to the \n      nefarious efforts of Gimdo and the rest of Neo-Geldra. Use your bullets \n      wisely and make Rolling Thunder proud.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
