{"id": 808454, "slug": "monster-of-the-weekend", "name": "Monster of the Weekend", "name_original": "Monster of the Weekend", "description": "<p>[[Made by inkear for Portland Indie Game Squad's Character Creator Summer Slow Jam]]<br/></p>\n\n<p>It's your first weekend home alone, which is a huge responsibility. <br/></p>\n<p>Also a huge responsibility? Taking care of the weird monster you found in the woods!</p>\n<p>Monster of the Weekend is a short, lighthearted adventure/virtual pet game, where the assortment of weird crap you feed to your little monster will determine how it grows and changes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But remember: nothing lasts forever. And your mom is allergic to pets! Better make this weekend count.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or WASD: Represents the D-Pad on a Gameboy. Use them to move around and navigate menus.<br/></p>\n<p>Alt, Z, J, or Forward Slash: Represents the 'A' Button on a Gameboy. Use it to interact with objects, advance text, and confirm menu choices.</p>\n<p>Control, K, X, or Period: Represents the 'B' Button on a Gameboy. I don't think you actually use it for anything, but you can back out of the pause menu with it if you want.</p>\n<p>Enter: Represents the Start Button on a Gameboy. Use it to enter the pause menu.</p>\n<p>Shift: Represents the Select Button on a Gameboy. Currently unused.</p>\n<p>Personally, I like to use WASD to move, and rest my right index and middle fingers on Period and Forward Slash. That lets me easily press Enter and Shift with my other fingers if necessary.<br/></p>\n\n<p>[[Oops, I overscoped! At this point in development, only 'Friday' is complete. You're welcome to wander around the gameworld once you get to Saturday, but you won't find much else to do. I'll do my best to finish the rest of the game in time for the Jam Showcase!]]</p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p>\n<p>-If you have items in your inventory, you can feed them to the monster while in your room, even if you haven't met the monster yet. The game kinda breaks if you do that, so if you get a prompt to 'feed it to the monster' and you haven't found the egg yet, please select 'no'. I'm working on fixing that now.</p>\n<p>-If you bring the egg back to your room, then leave the room, the egg disappears. To keep the game running smoothly, you should immediately interact with the egg once you get back to your room. Again, I'm working on fixing it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d4/0d42a7ad05fc9d7e5bbd2ce87384ee4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["inkear"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
