Why? i don't really know. Personally i don't even play card games, but for some reason i always wanted to make one. I don't know something about that as always drawn me in. so here is my attempt at making a simple card game. just to point out. this was made in around 4 days so its not he best i can do, and the development isn't finished yet.\u00a0I am planning on making the game better and perfecting it, as i know of a couple bugs in the game. I am also going to be releasing it on mobile, but currently there is an around 2 week review wait list for any google play store apps. so in a\u00a0 few weeks, the game should be out on mobile and should be heavily improve. but anyways i still hope you enjoy it and like</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef625320ff69f4d73f04474a793ef3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ZYGER"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
