Miranda's Ghost Vacuum is prone to exploding.</p>\n\n<p>___________________________<br/></p>\n\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move.</p>\n<p>Space for sucking in ghosts.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Catching ghosts decreases a random amount of the blue bar on the left side. Putting ghosts into the stabilizer (by entering the spiral next to it) replenishes the blue bar. If the bar hits zero, Miranda's Ghost Vacuum explodes and it's Game Over.<br/></p><p>___________________________</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p>I added an updated version with the following changes:</p>\n<p>- I fixed a weird problem where the timer would restart once it reached 60s.</p>\n<p>- Movement should feel much better now:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Miranda looks at the mouse, now. That means it's no longer necessary to use A + D (or Right Arrow + Left Arrow) for turning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- She also walks a bit faster. <br/>- I increased the size of the blue vacuum bar and the hearts.</p>\n<p>- It's now possible to suck in a few more ghosts and to get hit a few more times before dying.</p>\n<p>- I decreased the amound of ghosts that need to be caught in order to win.</p>\n<p><strong>I kept the original jam version for the WebGL build. As of right now, the updated version is downloadable only.</strong></p><strong>\n</strong><p><strong>I'll change this once the play+rate phase is over.</strong></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1569e00fe0db0a265f556f3ee6160d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sockenpuppe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
