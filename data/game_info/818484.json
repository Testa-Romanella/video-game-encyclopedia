This is effectively a tech-demo.</p>\n<p>I made this for two jams at once; 2022's GMTK Game Jam, and Aesthetician Labs' exprmt48 for 2022; the themes were \"Roll the Dice\" and \"Don't think too hard\" respectively. This game is the result of interpreting the first theme in such a way that required the least conceptual legwork; something without too much tricky brainstorming, something that could reuse code to handle a lot of boilerplate.<br/></p>\n<p>As only one person doing this jam casually, \u00a0I didn't have time to get very far, even when importing code from past projects; many things like the movement code needed improvement/bug-fixing. I \"wasted\" a lot of time on technically unnecessary things, but I learned from them, became a marginally better developer in the process, and felt smart. For that reason, I'm happy with the result!<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD\u00a0 ................................................................\u00a0 Move</li><li>Left/Right Mouse Drag/Arrow Keys\u00a0 .....\u00a0 Rotate Camera</li><li>Space\u00a0 ..................................................................\u00a0 Jump/Double Jump/Wall Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:43:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff01d1770770b362ae0de9d85bd01cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrickode"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
