The theme for this gamejam was rewind. For this game I decided to give the player the option to \"Rewind\"\u00a0 the time of the boxes so they go back to their original position.</p>\n<p>Because of time I created this game within 12 hours instead of the timeframe given\u00a0 by the gamejam. This was one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong><br/>BoxBlock is a game inspired by Sokoban.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a41511cd9965350bc0213bed3afc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kylevr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
