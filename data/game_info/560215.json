I cover how to utilize helper sprites and some wave equations to make your platforms mimic an impact wave propagating outward.  Physics and platformer effects still work with a reasonable amount of mesh points defined and can make for some awesome visuals / mechanics!\r\n</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>GAME CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tap to fire... watch cool resulting impact wave effects :)</strong></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I have included the project file to follow along\u00a0 and review how the event sheet / javascript work together.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to use however, no credit needed, cc0 etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check it out on YouTube and let me know what you think!\u00a0 Subscribe if you enjoyed, would make my day :)</p>\n\n<p>---<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I am a youtuber, creator of games / tutorials, and actively building a collection of art / assets for creators to use royalty free in their games.\u00a0 If you would like to support me, please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel (game dev focused)\u00a0and or supporting me on Patreon.\u00a0 Those who subscribe to the \"Game Asset Supporter\" tier will get access to all premium / paid art I own the rights to posted here on itch (new assets added monthly!).\u00a0 Cheers!</p>\n<p>YouTube:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/FoozleCC</p>\n<p>Patreon:</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/user?u=48464594</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>FoozleCC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T09:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c8a25229939a57a36c7508319ab742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoozleCC"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
