You will be trying to score more points than him.</p><p>The game presents this concept, in order for the player to get a feel for the competitive spin-off of this genre and decide whether he would like to play a fully fledged game of this type.</p><p>Following is how the game is now and, complementing that, what will be added in the full game:</p><p>- Now: two player competitive game. Future: bigger boards with multiple players, single or team-based matches.<br/>- Now: simultaneous play, on the same board. Future: turn-based modes, parallel boards a.s.o.<br/>- Now: point-based match. Future: combos, chains, power-ups, skills.<br/>- Now: single player, hot seat, multiplayer LAN. Future: Steam-based multiplayer matches; coop, competitive and mixed.<br/>- Now: single game mode, single board. Future: multiple game modes with different objectives, story driven, unlockables, multiple boards with different, diversified items.<br/>- Now: localization in a few languages. Future: localization in more languages, of course.<br/>- Now: fixed AI, not too hard, but not too easy. Future: different game difficulty settings.<br/>- Now: multiple input devices, including 2 XBox game-pads. Future: also multiple input devices, unlimited XBox game-pads.<br/>- Now: simple tutorial, explaining the basic game rules. Future: interactive tutorial.</p><p>Fun fact: you can deny an opponent's match if you move one of the animals that would form a row, before his moved animal comes into position with the others. This requires skill, but once you've mastered it, it becomes interesting and gratifying.</p><p><strong>Installation</strong><br/></p><p>To extract the game, you can use your favorite compression tool or the following, free one:</p><p>- <strong>7-Zip</strong>, from: http://www.7-zip.org/</p><p>Before running the game, you must install:</p><p>- <strong>DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)</strong>, from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.a...<br/>- <strong>Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 (x86)</strong>, from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.a...<br/>- <strong>LAVFilters</strong> (for playing music), from: http://www.videohelp.com/software/LAV-Filters</p><p><strong>Music Credits</strong><br/>- Blarsa, Garden Party: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/199965<br/>- LimeDisciple, Jungle Music: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/478215</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2c99e809be2ed9984560327618c868e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shere Khan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
