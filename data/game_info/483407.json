Well then this game is perfect for you. Travel through the stars with the crew of the ship, the Pompulus, and it's crew. You have Paula, the tough and vicious pig warrior. Then there's Clank, the resilient and resourceful turtle sharpshooter, who never comes out of his shell. Next up is Pablo. This cute little guy is still just a baby chick and can't seem to overcome his lisp or his wild emotions, yet he's the best pilot this galaxy's ever seen and has the brains to tell you every reason why. And finally, Ratthew, the rat captain of this weird, seemingly incompatible crew. Ratthew can't run fast, or pick up heavy objects, or do simple math, but he can dissolve any conflict in seconds with his wit and his charm. Now get ready to join Ratthew and his crew for the adventure of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>This game is about problem-solving.
