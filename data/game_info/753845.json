In this version you can just walk around and talk to NPCs. Not a lot of content yet, but if it looks interesting go ahead and check it out. Currently there is only a Windows build, but if there is some big demand for it, I might support other platforms, but its not considered a priority at this point.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move. \u00a0Use E or Left Mouse to interact if you see a red exclamation. Use E or Left Mouse to advance dialogue boxes. Use Z to lower music volume or X to increase volume. Press Space at any time to immediately quit to desktop. Use esc to toggle instruction box.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to support development of this project you can donate here:<br/>https://ko-fi.com/maxmichael99548<br/></p>\n<p>You can also help just by telling your friends to take a look.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:06:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48cba881f4dedfac6ae2258d92eff29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxFF"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
