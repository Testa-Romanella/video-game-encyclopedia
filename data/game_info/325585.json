Something with simplified tactics, basic 3D graphics and a medieval theme. After a few weeks of testing, I found\u00a0it lacked the depth, so it's on indefinite hold unless there's expressed interest or I think of a way to add depth.</p>\n\n<p>Some levels are way too hard, but all are definitely possible to complete. So, if you're\u00a0the first person to beat all the levels, I'll design and send you a t-shirt for free. Send me a message or comment with proof to claim.\u00a0\u00a0CLAIMED by @m001 congrats!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05c8e8a2b55703b5bf0e23d40bd5682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["seancode"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
