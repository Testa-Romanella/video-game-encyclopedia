My focus with this project was to experiment with the character controls and core gameplay feature (which is exploding sphere enemies, lol). I wanted to test out my knowledge in game feel and try to apply it in just 24 hours. I experimented with different character control systems and tried to polish the game feel as much as possible.\u00a0</p><p>So, there is no gameplay loop or win/lose states implemented in the game. Just open it, control your crazy rocket, explode some HUGE *but deadly* spheres and RELAX!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys: Move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T09:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/ceb17976348f826e02699809c681be22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkyBrave"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
