As hard-boiled detective Rem Rasul, you'll have to rely on your uncanny powers of deduction, your trusty revolver, and your crippling addiction to nicotine in order to track down the culprit and solve this mystery. However, you soon discover that there's more to this case than meets the eye...</p>\n<p>A homage to B-games from the early 2000s such as Revenge of the Sunfish and Sexy Hiking, The Robbing of Rem Rasul features 24 poorly-drawn levels spanning a variety of game genres - action, adventure, platforming, puzzle-solving, and even turn-based role-playing. This diverse collection of play styles, combined with a hodge-podge of bizarre graphics and blatantly stolen audio effects, ultimately makes for a surreal yet satisfying gaming experience.</p>\n<p>You can view additional resources by visiting\u00a0http://www.michaelseaholm.com/game_development<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc61363e33d6834d389713cb645770ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fyndr"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
