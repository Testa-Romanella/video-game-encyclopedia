You roam around the map dumpster diving stores and re-selling found items at a pawn shop. With the money earned, you can buy various upgrades or a bus ticket that lets you travel quickly around the map. There's also a\u00a0 guard dog that chases off security guards that try to send you to jail for dumpster diving. Another obstacle you face is hunger, which forces you to replenish yourself with tasty dumpster food. I frequently make developer logs regarding this game;\u00a0they are linked\u00a0here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T02:55:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67ba353ac4f0afdfa54e29e95c51ef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Wiest"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
