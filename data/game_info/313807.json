{"id": 313807, "slug": "reozma", "name": "RE:OZMA", "name_original": "RE:OZMA", "description": "<p>RE:OZMA: The adventure has begun to find new creature!<br />\nRE:OZMA is a &#39;Crossover genre game&#39;, combined with 2D sandbox, strategy and space simulation, shooting, roguelike, RPG, platformer. This is a kind of \u20182D picaresque game\u2019, you can enjoy the mash-up genre in one game.</p>\n<p>Features:<br />\nThe core concept of RE: OZMA is \u2018autonomy\u2019, \u2018fusion\u2019 and \u2018entertainment\u2019; it is a game where a gamer is finding the meaning of one\u2019s being in the space while raising its character and surviving through the unknown world by meeting and connecting with other beings.<br />\nEach character gets their own unique planets, randomly meets endless stars in the cosmos and encounters many events and situations while cultivating and developing its living planet. Also, each character will run into different \u2018creatures\u2019; they sometimes live together, fight against the being (enemy) that destroys life, and conquer the planet.  Players will cultivate and protect their own planets by using their full capability of survival instinct. Through these adventures, finally, the player will grow and rediscover himself. 1. If you want, everything is possible!  First when the user logs into the game, they will customize each of their characters and planets. Then, the user will enter the world map; here, there are many planets. Not only ones created by each player, but also various UFOs, metal planets, fire planets, snow planets, gas planets, NPC planets with different concepts, and event planets. Each planet is rotating and orbiting in random order and each planet\u2019s difficulties are all different. The user can choose the planet they want to enter.<br />\n2. Creating One\u2019s Own World! &quot;Field!&quot;   When the user enters their own planet, they really start to build their \u2018sand castle\u2019: creating their world in a sandbox format. RE: OZMA\u2019s planets are formed with random fields, created from random algorithm, and instant fields that are connected to the field.<br />\n-- Plays that the user can do on the field<br />\nFirst, the field provides Moding environment; it allows the user to collect, craft, grow, install, fish, and housing. The player can experience \u201cCollect\u201d, \u201cBoast\u201d, and \u201cMulti-play and help\u201d on field contents; Also, since the field allows combat mode, the user can create their own unique game world by modifying the terrain just like building a sand castle. Once the user builds storage, it increases the inventory space; when the user expands the house, the NPCs will visit, and the player can place various trophies in their house from hunting bosses.  When other players visit the user\u2019s world, the user can share everything with that player.<br />\nAlso, during the field event, occurring under special circumstances, it will provide a unique experience and unique items that no one else has.</p>\n<p>-- Field\u2019s background &amp; interaction with weather effect<br />\nRe: OZMA\u2019s background within the planet allows the player to utilize every space: ground, sky, underground and the cosmos. The ground, sky, and underground allows the user to build and destroy anything at their will; meanwhile, space is mostly for adventuring.<br />\nEvery weather effect such as snow, rain, wind, storm, and others are created to interact with the user. When the wind blows, the player will have a hard time moving due to wind\u2019s resistance. When it rains, it will limit the player\u2019s vision; when it snows, it will make the player hard to move due to them slipping. Also, the game environment changes based on the flow of time from morning to night and depends on the character\u2019s behavior (ex. Use of Skill), the terrain change follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Creating One\u2019s Own World! &quot;Crafting&quot; The player can craft various items by combining hundreds of materials. Every item in the game can be used as material to build something: minerals, soil, stone, and sand from mining underground; trees, grass, flowers, and a piece of wing from a monster.<br />\nBuildings that are beneficial to the user will get targeted by the monsters (enemy); to protect them, the player may have to build terrets.<br />\n3) Spontaneous meeting and trading with other players<br />\nRE:OZMA provides single and IP play.

Why is the game name RE: OZMA?<br />\nRE:OZMA is inspired by the first SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project. It was launched by the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1968. Even in 2019, the \u2018Project OZMA\u2019is still on going after many trials by lots of scientists for the past several decades. We decided to call our game \u201cRE: OZMA\u201d, combining the word \u201cRE\u201d and \u201cOZMA&quot;, because we were inspired by many people\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit towards project OZMA and its history.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/82673add240083b0fc92809154e939d4.jpg", "website": "http://reozma.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SHITFTRICK"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SHITFTRICK"], "esrb_rating": null}
