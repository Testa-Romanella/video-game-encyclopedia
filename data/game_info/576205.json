It turns out not having to come up with your own ideas and just being able to copy art is incredibly timesaving and lets me get straight down to what I am trying to learn, game development and design.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I have learned a lot while doing this project, animation in unity. the sound design in unity and a bunch more bits and bobs to do with scripting and the way systems work to do with spawning or loot drops for example. I felt this has been my most productive week yet (albeit the sample size is not massive) due to the amount I have learned and the progress I have made.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Next up I want to progress with making my own assets and art. It would be nice to find a style and flow with that sort of thing. I also think making a small puzzle game would teach me a\u00a0lot. I very much liked working in 2d with a top-down style and want to continue developing my skills in this style, but also want to try some 3d at some point.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated, all the art, assets and music is from the game Stardew Valley. This is not a commercial venture at all and just a small project to help me learn how to make games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T09:03:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/798b2a44482217cf4b44317f3df64f27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leon stansfield"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
