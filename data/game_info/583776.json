There is no combat system.\u00a0 You can get out of enemy encounters through other means. Please don't disqualify me from the jam.\u00a0 Also, the game's lore is found through posters scattered around the world and you discover your own fate and why are you trapped in this maze. At least it isn't a whole block of text at the beginning of the game.
