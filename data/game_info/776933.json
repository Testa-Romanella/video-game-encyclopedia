Forced to fight not just for their lives, but the lives of all their loyal fans, viewers, and possibly the entire world, the trio set off to discover the source of the evil set loose on the world - and perhaps learn a thing or two about themselves along the way.</p>\n<p>This JRPG-style adventure is a\u00a0one-man labor of love featuring hand-made sprites, custom arrangements of traditional Turkish music, and a clever, insightful narrative. Planned as Part 1 of a 5-part series that spans multiple worlds and introduces new and familiar faces, your generous donation helps buy me the time to complete this epic quest!</p><p>Gamepad/controller highly recommended, but it can be played with mouse+keyboard easily. I\u00a0prefer click-moving to WASD but you can use either!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Ottomania, Part I of A Turk Story!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T10:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4ce8db34f0d5ba7af3d1806acaec9ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rain101"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
