software of this nature is included. \u00a0</p>\n<p>(For example if you download Monty on the Run for the Commodore 64 onto your PC Hard-Drive then it is expected that you have the game somewhere up in the loft.)</p>\n<p>Lawfully I am breaking none, to the best of my knowledge, in creating this software and personally I was highly inspired by the commodore from the age 12 and was held captive in mental acclimation; now, some 32 years later, I have spent a lot of my life getting to understand computers.</p>\n<p>The software is at the stage of full functionality and now my next actions are to make this software known world wide; this is where the power of YOU, the individual can assist; if you are like minded when considering that OODLES and OODLES of mega-fantastic, awe inspiring games from decades ago should be shared and interspersed into the futuristic, battlefield called the current day game market. \u00a0\u2014 I would much rather my son collect flashing objects in Jet Set Willy or Manic Miner on the C64; or search out the caves of Finders Keepers on the ZX Spectrum, or jostle \u00a0and jump about in colourful worlds such as seen in the likes of James Pond, Fire and Ice or Ruff \u2018n\u2019 Tumble (all amiga).</p>\n<p>For Further Details or any other comments or queries you may have please email :- ajs__2@excite.com</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this site and consider attaining your own copy of Emultivator. \u00a0Please refer to other sections of the website for screenshots and other information.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Simple, effective and logical\u2026</p>\n<p>SMAZOGZ Emultivator gives its users an easy to operate interface and offers access to thousands of games released on the consoles and computers of yesterday.</p>\n<p>This software <strong>does not </strong>emulate any software itself, it merely acts as a graphical user interface (GUI). \u00a0It uses a pre-allocated directory structuring system which is pliable in its placement; ensuring file system stability.</p>\n<p>Built in functionality uses specific command line flags which automatically runs the game then emulator in a full screen window.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that all the emulators are Freeware and all operate under the GNU GPL. \u00a0The only reason I am charging for software as it is worthy of a price tag; it took months to work out how to get everything running smoothly.</p>\n<p>Ideally we would like to sell this with ALL the Roms and BIOS Roms but for legality reasons this us an achievable goal, what we can do though is to provide you, the end-user with the option to acquire the Game Roms and BIOS Roms based on the specific systems and software you specifically own.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SMAZOGZ Emultivator\u00a0hopes users will donate to the people and organisations who developed the Emulators and is happy to answer any questions. \u00a0Additionally if you are an owner of one of the used emulators and do not condone its inclusion in this product down please email me directly. \u00a0It is my aim and ambition to bring the old games from the early years of computing back to life so as to create a warming friendliness amongst us all. \u00a0I do not wish to violate any copyrights and all works external from the Multivator executable remain the copyright of their original owners. \u00a0We accept no responsibility for how this software is used.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>THANK YOU AND HAPPY GAMING</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b0179d125e46d7cd28dcc98e30b971f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SMAZOGZ Emultivator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
