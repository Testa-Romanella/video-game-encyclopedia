The game takes place in a magical forest, and the only way to escape is to find the witch controlling the forest and kill her! The game is a 2D top-down action game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Sound Designer, Assistant Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Team Size</strong>: 5</p>\n<p><strong>Project Length</strong>: 3 Months\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Programs I used</strong>: Unity, Visual Studio, Github, Audacity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages I used</strong>: C#\r\n</p>\n\n<p>For this project I was sound designer and assistant programmer, which was difficult as I was not very familiar with sound design before this project. As a programmer, I programmed most of the spells of the game, as well as half of the enemies. I also created a leveling system which increases item drops. This project was a challenge as it was the first time I was spending an entire semester working on one project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift Key - Dodge\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Click - Sword Attack\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Click and Scroll down - Bow Attack\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Open Spell menu\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Click - Cast Spell that is loaded</p>\n\n<p>Link to Github repository:\u00a0https://github.com/zokie0/WitchWood\r\n</p><p>Link to original project page:\u00a0https://decalf.itch.io/witchwood</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21c/21c8d157fe55260f57b8464975a1f685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ronald DeSilva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
