Your outposts have fallen - your drop zone just became the front line. Strap a Jet Pack onto your battle armor and select from the lethal array of weaponry - you and your squad are all that stand between Earth and the savage horror of the relentless Skull hordes.<br />\nGet vertical or get dead.<br />\nShould you attack from the sky? What about escaping the cavernous depths? Shrewd use of your Jet Pack fuel keeps your options open.<br />\nMake no mistake, you&#39;re the prey.<br />\nSkulls hunt in packs. They swarm, they flank, and they learn from their mistakes.<br />\nDeath knows no boundaries.<br />\nBlasting through a cave&#39;s close quarters takes a different strategy (and weaponry) than speeding through the vast vertical zones.<br />\nThere is no path of least resistance.<br />\nJet pack, hang glide, or hit the ground running - how you get through the Skulls is up to you.<br />\nBecome an efficient killing machine.<br />\nMission after mission - equip yourself wisely and you just might survive.<br />\nNowhere to hide.<br />\nSkulls attack and ambush from every direction - including up.<br />\nPolish your devastation skills.<br />\nWield a lethal arsenal that includes flamethrowers, mines, heat seeking swarm missiles, and frag grenades.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T04:04:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/206/206f47c83270e94cdf1cefd16a5468ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 16, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SingleTrac", "Singletrak Studios", "SingleTrac Entertainment Technologies"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Throwback Entertainment", "MIRROR Soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
