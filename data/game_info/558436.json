In this land populated by square trees, square clouds and square people, Mr Cube has fallen in love. However, our hero\u2019s love interest is on the opposite side of the world \u2013 and between them lies a land full of hazards, obstacles and dangerous critters! Not only that, but Mr Cube is flat broke and he needs to raise enough cash during his quest to ensure that he can pay for safe passage home for both himself and his sweetie! Oh, did I forget to mention that time is incredibly tight? Mr Cube will have to run and jump as quickly as he can if he\u2019s to make it before his energy runs out. He\u2019ll need all his stamina for the ceremony of geometrical pairing!</p>\n<p>Steady your nerves, prepare your reflexes.</p>\n<p><strong>Playing Tiny Quest</strong></p>\n<p>Tiny Quest is a game that requires lightning-fast reflexes, excellent memory, advanced planning skills, perfect timing and (a lot of) self control. You have been warned. There will be times when things appear hopeless \u2013 but you have our word \u2013 even the hardest screens are possible to beat with practice!\r\nUsing a joystick plugged into PORT 2, guide Mr Cube safely through the land to find his true love. To clear each single-screen level, you\u2019ll need to grab any spinning coins and make it to the exit (the exit sign lights up when it is open). On the way you will face many different hazards, obstacles and environments. You will have to jump and run as fast as you can before your rapidly-decreasing energy runs out.\u00a0 Watch out not to step on those nasty traps! Every mistake will cost you one of your 5 precious lives \u2013 and once all of your lives are lost\u2026 your quest will be over!</p>\n<p>To help you on your way, a password (a combination of directional pushes on the joystick) is awarded for completing each set of 15 levels. These passwords act as check-points, allowing you to continue your quest after each Game Over. However! The passwords are NOT permanent and only last for each play session \u2013 they change every time you reload the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\r\nOriginal Concept/Code : Andrea \u201cWanax\u201d Schincaglia\r\nGraphics: Federico \u201cRaffox\u201d Sesler\r\nMusic: Gaetano Chiummo, Stefano \u201cDustbin\u201d Palmonari\r\nBox/Cover Illustration: Simon Butler\r\nManual Design &amp; Layout: Chris Mantil</p>\n<p>Darren Doyle, Jamie Battison &amp; James Monkman <br/></p>\n<p>Production\r\nSpecial thanks to Eric Akeson, Stefano Canali and Fulvio Ieva for additional testing.</p>\n<p>Buy the cartridge version HERE for \u00a332 (from RGCD)</p>\n<p>Buy the disk version HERE for \u00a325 (from Bitmap Soft)</p>\n<p>Buy the tape version HERE for \u00a310 (from Bitmap Soft)</p>\r\nby                     Bitmap Soft          ,                                                 Digital Monastery          ,                                                 Rebel Bytes          ,                                        and           RGCD          ,", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbe869800003d074669d4d3902d53cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bitmap Soft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
