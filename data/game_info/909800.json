We planned two apps, one is this Virtual Planet Builder, and another is the AR Engine in development. All creations will eventually be compatible with computers and the majority of Mixed-reality Headsets.<h3>Fun and Easy World Building</h3>System Terminal: Virtual Planet Builder is a sandbox engine that allows you to build your dream world with blocks. It is fun and easy, unlike a game engine, but it can create things at the game engine level. Come here to build your worldview!<h3>Smaller Blocks, More Creativity</h3>A state-of-the-art 3D algorithm can achieve real-time editing of much smaller blocks, giving you more creative freedom. Unlike other world-building engines, you can use our tool to shape anything you want from scratch.<h3>Created By Players for Players</h3>We are dedicated to building virtual experiences that focus on the players' interests, a world created by players and for players, where all are welcome to play and create.<h3>How to participate more?</h3>Join our discord community to participate in weekly BuildJam. You can get a chance to test the latest features and talk with the developer team.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T04:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd84796eab5c00b802fa035609691f7.jpg", "website": "https://st.world", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ST Platform"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["ST Platform"], "esrb_rating": null}
