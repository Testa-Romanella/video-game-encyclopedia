If so, this subclass is for you. The<em> Pugilist</em> stands as a stark alternative to the weapons-based martial archetypes of 5th Edition's Fighter, specializing instead in strong fists, a healthy body, and excellent facial hair.</p>\n<p>While the subclass is flavored strongly around the idea of a boxer, and being a strength-based alternative to everyone's favorite martial arts class, the <em>Pugilist</em> can be applied much more broadly! From back-alley bruisers to unyielding paragons, the <em>Pugilist</em> is useful for anyone wanting to turn taking punishment into an advantage!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T12:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8ea1fdc7980e3d9f360526c95ebf41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isaac"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
