You assign teams of two to missions that fit their skillsets. When you don't assign them to a mission, your guild members will decide based off of their own behavior trees which stat they decide to slightly increase while at the Guild Hall. The goal is to successfully complete as many missions as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dr. Martens: Advisor<br/></p>\n<p>Owais Iqbal:\u00a0Game engine creator and Programming assistance</p>\n<p>Claire Christopher:\u00a0Programmer, Game designer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rook Liu: Artist, Game designer</p>\n<p>Everyone else in the lab: Helping Rook out of programming mishaps he created for himself\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:03:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a41cf1534e81de27e2d63088c199096f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RookLiu", "noodlemangos"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
