As if it wasn&#39;t odd enough to see a girl trapped in a cage, stranger still, she has wolf ears and a tail. When she finally manages to tell them her name, Sakuraba Iroha, they learn that she&#39;s the girl who was spirited away from town ten years ago. Now more animal than girl, wild and unable to speak, Iroha proves to be a handful for Shuuji, and yet he finds himself falling in love with her fierce innocence.<br />\nBut the torn pages of a calendar can never be restored, and Iroha will never regain her lost years. Her idyllic past behind her, Iroha now faces forward. Watching over her, Shuuji wonders to himself: What is it that makes me want to protect you? Iroha&#39;s past is gone but not forgotten, and her future remains unknown. What will she and Shuuji make of it?FeaturesCG Gallery - View your favorite CGs!<br />\nMusic gallery - Listen to your favorite tracks!<br />\nCharacter art by Motomiya Mitsuki<br />\nSD art by Toma Tokage<br />\nScenario by NYAON</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-09T03:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08e/08eacf44402b01f2556c1aad1455cca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 12, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 531, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sweet & Tea"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
