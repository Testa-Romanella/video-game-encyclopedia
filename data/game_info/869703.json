There they use their magic to heal the sick and injured.<br/><br/>One day, while the sisters are enjoying a meal, they are interrupted by a strange noise coming from their basement. However, it is no ordinary basement, but a library full of magical books passed down through their family for generations.<br/><br/>Fearing that it may be a ghost, they cautiously go to investigate and find a book engulfed in a glowing light. Instinctively, Tear reached out toward the glowing tome and as she did, it flipped open!<br/><br/>Before either of the sisters could blink, out leaped a terrifying demon who grabbed Lumiere and pulled her into the tome.<br/><br/>\"If you want to see your sister alive again, then you'll have to come get her! Hahaha!\"<br/><br/>Knowing that it may be a trap, Tear gathered her courage to follow them and bring her sister home safe and sound.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Classic RPG Experience<br/></li><li>Turn-based Combat<br/></li><li>Level Up with Experience<br/></li><li>Gain New Skills with Levels<br/></li><li>Get Help in Battle from the Fox Spirit Korin</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T13:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61b/61b07fbb473f6521ca6d33c042546936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acerola"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kagura Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
