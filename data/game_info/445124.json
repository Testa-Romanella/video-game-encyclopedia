{"id": 445124, "slug": "sickness-shootout", "name": "Sickness Shootout", "name_original": "Sickness Shootout", "description": "<p>The only difference between version 1.0 and 1.1 is that I fixed a UI scaling bug, which was permitted by the jam hosts.</p>\n<p>This skill-based top down shooter\u00a0was created in one week for the CCC Game Jam. The theme for the game jam was playing both sides. (Also, this game is NOT about COVID, so please don't make comments related to COVID)</p><p>What makes it different from most other top down shooters is the objective. Instead of trying to eliminate all enemies, you must keep both sides in balance,\u00a0 if that means shooting at enemies or even tactifully eliminating your own ally bacteria.\u00a0Also, bacteria can mutate over time, so bacteria in the game will randomly mutate, including yourself!</p>\n<p>I highly recommend playing the tutorial as I go more in depth there, but I will give you a basic rundown below.</p>\n<p>There are two abilities to be used:</p>\n<p>E: This ability is an area of effect ability, which freezes and poisons ally bacteria, by creating a habitat where they cannot live.</p>\n<p>F: This ability is a health pack which is randomly placed somewhere on the map, and you must go find it by following the cursor to recharge your health. Note: You cannot put down more than one health pack at a time.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing the game, and thanks to all the content creators for hosting this jam!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------Credit-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Font: Bakso Sapi By: https://www.dafont.com/arwan-sutanto.d5701</p>\n<p>Sounds: (It may be worth mentioning that foreach of these sounds I at least edited them a little)</p>\n<p>-E-Ability:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Rurbital/sounds/342936/</p>\n<p>-Health Pack:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/jtn191/sounds/514271/</p>\n<p>-Error Sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/distillerystudio/sounds/327736/</p>\n<p>-Finger Snap:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/herraportti/sounds/436667/</p>\n<p>-Kick drum:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/karolist/sounds/371192/</p>\n<p>-Shot:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/OtisJames/sounds/215162/</p>\n<p>-Cash Register:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/CapsLok/sounds/184438/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aab1c1da00571fd09997bc79b5b9885e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lucky89"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
