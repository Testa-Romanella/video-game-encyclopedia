This is the basic premise of <strong>Indiecalypse</strong>, JanduSoft\u2019s upcoming release, sadly based on actual events.<br/><br/><strong>Indiecalypse</strong> depicts the crude reality of indie game developers and their struggles to get their shit together when it comes to releasing a video game. <br/><br/>Three misfits team up to design and produce their own indie game, finding themselves in a path of chaos, self-destruction and resentment. But there\u2019s also space for crude humor, pop culture references, gratuitous and non-gratuitous violence... and fear. Fear of the dozens of lawsuits for copyright infringement, obscenity and profanity we\u2019ll have to face if the game is finally published.<br/><br/>It sounds wonderful, but\u2026<br/><strong>How do I play Indiecalypse?</strong><br/><br/>In Indiecalypse we'll play as Jack Jackson (programming), Ethan Wornick (music) and Violet Oakly (art), and live their own particular stories. The game's main mechanic is based on modern exploration/adventure games, but Indiecalypse also includes more than 20 mini-games, most of them copied, sorry, based (let's say inspired by...) some of the most popular games and mechanics in video game history. Check them out below!<br/><br/>Not everything is what it seems in Indiecalypse, and we know for sure that no one will be left indifferent after playing it.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for?
