{"id": 155123, "slug": "linx-battle-arena-itch", "name": "Linx Battle Arena (itch)", "name_original": "Linx Battle Arena (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Follow the development of Linx Battle Arena as I take it from concept to full-on, online third person shooter, and a single player, mission based Rogue Like Survival shooter.<br/><br/> </strong> <strong>Run, Shoot, Drive, Survive.</strong><br/>Linx Battle Arena takes the third person survival shooter in a new direction with fast paced action based matches where you will constantly be aware of how vulnerable you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer\u00a0is pure PVP</strong>. No teams, just you versus everyone else in a fight to the death.</p>\n<p>In every match, you will start off with a single handgun with 5 bullets and only 50% health.</p>\n<p>Linx Battle Arena is still under development and I am looking to the community to guide the direction of the game. Use the\u00a0forums \u00a0on Steam\u00a0to give me feedback so that the game you want is the end product that I will produce.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME TYPES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SUPREMACY</strong></p>\n<p>Find cash boxes across the arenas to buy guns and health. You can only ever carry 1 gun and 1 clip so you will always be vulnerable to a quick attack and so will your enemies so arena domination will not come easily.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR THE WIN</strong></p>\n<p>No cash boxes needed for weapons here, just get to the Gun Stations to get your next weapon. Each time you run out of ammo, the gun station will give you a new random gun. This could put you back to the Mk7 Gillan Pistol or if luck is on your side you might get the V3 Plasma Launcher. Health stations are positioned around the arenas so get cash boxes to survive.<br/><br/> <strong>Single Player Openworld Rogue Like Survival</strong><br/><strong>(under development - due 2nd quarter 2018)<br/> </strong>Based around the open world map of Teriach Island, you will take on missions in rogue like scenarios, trying to achieve your goals while constantly being hunted down by the guardians of Teriach Island: The Sentinels.<br/><br/> You will start with 1 hand gun, 5 bullets and half health. It is up to you to gather cash, load up new guns and fight to own Teriach Island. Complete the missions and gain the prestigious Steam Achievements. Multiple missions types will be announced on release of the Single Player DLC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad0ae1347b22f34b440867bb6f25317a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blueshift"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
