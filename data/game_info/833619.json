That's pretty much it.</li><li>Press 'M' to toggle the minimap.</li><li>Use the arrow keys to pan, or move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen.</li><li>Left click and drag to select units, or left click to select an individual unit, building, or resource.</li><li>When you select a unit or building, the commands window will appear on the bottom right if that unit has commands to issue.
