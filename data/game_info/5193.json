The game is set in the fictional Oddworld universe inhabited by extraterrestrials. The story follows Abe, a slave on the Mudokon meat factory, who suddenly realizes the perspective of being slaughtered in the near future with all of his fellow slaves. Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers\u2019 mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players\u2019 mistake from failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will cause death and a restart of the level from the last checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters). However, their help is only available in safe areas, so the Mudokons\u2019 rescue is though up to Abe.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "1997-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T20:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2ae/2aedae90b1377a0f3e5ce54d24f8e41a.jpg", "website": "http://www.oddworld.com/?p=68", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 412, "owned": 4589, "beaten": 206, "toplay": 70, "dropped": 225, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 549, "suggestions_count": 544, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 551, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Oddworld Inhabitants", "Saffire", "Digital Dialect"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["GT Interactive Software", "Oddworld Inhabitants", "SoftBank", "PSN", "SCE"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
