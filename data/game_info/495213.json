I couldn't do it in the original and I certainly haven't been able to have the patience to do it for this clone. If you can survive through all 14 rounds, I\u00a0must say I\u00a0applaud you for doing what I could not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/2122d34986d1fe07454dfc8afd723d15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gensuta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
