I had difficulties writing the C# code and following the video at the same time. The camera position on the canvas was a bit hard for me to position the object to display on the gaming canvas. Also, it took a long time for me to understand the scaling of the click detector so I can position the button and the sliders. Apart from these issues, I was able to work smoothly and completed the game. I added a picture and colors to the canvas so that my game will look a bit unique. I changed the RGB colors for the game in C#. After the scene builds and publish, I had issues with the ratio of the canvas. The aliment of slider and button was all over the place on the web. So, I had to go back and recreate the ratio and rebuild the scene and publish it on the web.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20d6235c696e1e87540948e60e47b1fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["opokukwafo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
