I wanted to create these worlds and experiences for others!<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun making this game (over many years on and off!), learning to program a full &amp; complex game on my own, with procedurally generated missions that are different every time you play!  I still have a lot of fun playing it myself, and I hope you love it too.<br/><br/>I'm super excited about hearing what you think!  If you like it, tell someone about it!\"<br/><br/>- Your pal, Murray", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a820865113b9434694cf5ed0b52ce097.jpg", "website": "http://www.muzboz.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["muzboz"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Murray Lorden"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
