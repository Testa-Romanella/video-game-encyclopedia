People just keep going around it, using it for, \u201clane merging,\u201d or, \u201cgetting somewhere else.\u201d But what if\u2026 the traffic circle WAS the destination? That angle, those obstacles, this\u2026 aesthetic. Everyone else is wrong. Show those plebeian passengers what it\u2019s truly like to be a Divine Drifter.</p>\n<ul><li>Slide sideways through 6 traffic circles so you can show everyone in the city your driving prowess</li><li>You can\u2019t leave until you prove you\u2019re the coolest cat on the road by:<ul><li>Drifting close to other vehicles</li><li>Scraping paint off the uncool motorists</li><li>Drifting under semi trucks</li><li>Tailgating</li><li>Breaking roadblocks and knocking out cones. Nobody likes a road with no freedom.</li></ul></li><li>Drifting increases your score multiplier, but if you drift alone for too long you\u2019ll burn out and lose your bonus</li><li>Compete for a live high score with other Drifters through an online leaderboard</li></ul>\n<p>Note: The menus must be navigated with a mouse, but the car can be controlled with either M&amp;K or a gamepad.</p>\n\n\n\r\nAll music original!
