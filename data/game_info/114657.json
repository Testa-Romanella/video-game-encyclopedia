{"id": 114657, "slug": "feel-better", "name": "feel better", "name_original": "feel better", "description": "<p>'feel better' is an experiment in whether or not I am capable of making something that is actually a \"game\" in the traditional sense. I wanted to see if I could use the traditional language of games to say something meaningful to me. This is was mostly in response to feedback that I was getting about how my games \"weren't\" or \"didn't have to be\" games.</p><p>What I learned is I probably shouldn't use spite over those comments as the driving force behind why I'm making a game. Still, I think it was a good exercise and I learned some things; mostly that making 2D platformers is super boring and I don't want to do it again for at least a long time. Possibly ever.</p><p>I know the level design isn't great; that's kind of the point. Still, it might be interesting to go back and make it actually \"well designed\" with a good difficulty curve, just to see if I can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616f480bf334641618c1cda63d02f33b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chloe lister"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
