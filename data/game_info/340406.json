This is just a simple prototype I built to test out the concepts. In the game you play as a cat, jumping and smashing blue boxes while avoiding horrible red boxes. This is a sideways runner, so you never stop, at least until you touch the green box, which is supposed to a cat bed.</p>\n<p>I currently don't have plans to further update this game, but still have the code so I could come back to this. So I am leaving comments open for constructive criticism of the game. If you would like to see more do let me know!</p>\n<p>\"Fun in a Bottle\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e1227eac4040a45cf819c7069d7fad82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fluffy Dino"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
