It was the first time for most of us to work on building a game with VR. Connecting the controllers and things about the virtual space on the player scale was new and interesting to think about. Also, we learned to scale down a project. At first, we had the voice input system going. However, since it was only available in windows, we quickly scaled down the idea from calling the ingredients out to a puzzle-solving escape room. This allowed us to finish our project in time. Last but not least, we learned to always test with VR. Even if something seemed like it was working, that was not the case when we built it and tested it in our VR. After going through the whole debugging process on our playtest day, we were able to realize that it is crucial to test the game out in VR no matter how small the correction was.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Next steps:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Our current game is functioning well, but there is potential to make this even better. For our next step, we could make the game more user-friendly. As we got from the feedback, it would be comfortable and make more sense with the theme of our game to have an inventory system. Also crossing out or eliminating the added ingredients can improve the user experience and add a more magical vibe. Randomizing the list of ingredients and their locations could be something to think about since our current game does not have level systems.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Interaction with the recipes (crossing out)</p><p>Randomize list of items &amp; locations</p>\n<p>Inventory\r\n</p>\n<p>raycast\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867b3f9ec5fb8a18ca0f2bfabc4a498f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["yaogeezi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
