FORGIVE ME...</strong><br/><br/>ZANZIBART is a simple roguelite where you avoid bullets &amp; hordes of enemies while mowing them down as fast as you can. Collect diverse items with infinitely stacking effects, and accumulate more with each run's progress to finally reach the end and avenge ZANZIBART.<br/><br/>The game is a comical homage to certain classic Japanese ARPGs &amp; dungeon crawlers - every character, item, and enemy is some kind of riff or reference.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T03:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c89ce4a3acfae49309a7d06aee1e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jcorners", "J Corners"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["J Corners"], "esrb_rating": null}
