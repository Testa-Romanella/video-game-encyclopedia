In this game players are encouraged to explore this strange world that is crawling with dangerous creatures to find the materials necessary to upgrade their abilities and fix their space ship in order to get back home.\r\n</p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>\tPlanet E4R7H is a forbidden landing zone in which the main character was forced to land after a malfunction in their ship. The origin of why this planet is forbidden has long been forgotten. The main character has no information about what they will encounter in this world and they have only a standard blaster to defend themselves. Upon landing you must set up a base to protect what remains of your ship while you explore the surrounding area in search of missing pieces of your ship. During exploration the player will encounter different types of enemies that will either target them or the base itself. The player must use whatever resources they can find to fend off waves of enemies that may threaten their return home.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tAs the game progresses, the difficulty will increase significantly. In the beginning the enemies will spawn less frequently giving the player more time to explore and find materials to upgrade their weapons and base. The enemies will drop materials when killed and the spaceship parts will be scattered across the terrain. The player must find a safe balance between exploration of the world and protection of the base as if the base is destroyed, the player can no longer respawn and it will be game over. Once the player collects all the missing spaceship parts the player can return to their base and leave the mysterious planet.\r\n</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<ul><li>Use WASD to walk around the horrible planet.</li><li>Left mouse click to shoot your gun</li><li>Right mouse click when in front of your desk to access the upgrade menu</li><li>Press F to toggle your flashlight</li><li>Pick up materials from around the planet to upgrade your base and weapon</li><li>Oh yeah, and make sure the planet's hostile entities kill you or your base.</li></ul>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Galindo Morales,\u00a0Nikhil Ramesh, Maya Duarte<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/0543892f3912cf5b3d5b13eb0762234e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team11-PlanetE4R7H"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
