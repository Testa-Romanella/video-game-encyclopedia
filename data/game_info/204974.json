It was intended to be a simple 3D spin-off of Tim's game that he was making on-stream. The whole project was inspired by Jaiden; I didn't think i would have enough time and wasn't going to join the Jam (which i found out about an hour before it started, was a bit last minute.) All in all I don't feel it went terribly. I learned quite a but from the coding challenge, and wound up with a really smooth prototype that has a ton of potential for improvements and expansion. Enjoy and please feel free to leave your feedback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4dab720ece3ce86dbeca7f8fd515de8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wallace.Donegan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
