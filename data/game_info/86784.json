She's your responsibility now.  You must take care of her, feed him, help her rebuild her lost family.  This young cat is last remaining member of the legendary Zuma Family. It is up to you to help her rebuild her tribe by finding new members.  Since the great defeat of the Zuma Clan, other competing families have taken over the Safari landscape. The goal of the game is to regain control and rule the territory again.  Victory will be yours! <br/><br/>Help this fast cat navigate the wild safari landscape, explore crocodile infested rivers, fight against cheetahs, hyenas, Elephants, Lions, Leopards, snakes and other dangerous animals.   This high action animal simulator will keep you on the edge of your seat.   Yet, this is no ordinary animal simulator . . . <br/><br/>In Clan of Cheetahs, you enter into a world of both epic adventure and magic.  Your cheetah will unlock special magical spells as you locate various magical spell books. These special abilities include: lighting bolt, invincibility, fireball, and healing .
