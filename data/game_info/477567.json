Made with Gamemaker 8.0 Pro.<br/></p>\n<p>Submitted this a little early because I wouldn't have time to work on it today. (8/9/2020)</p>\n<p>The rooms are kinda small, so it's recommended to press F4 to run in fullscreen.</p>\n<p>(If that doesn't work, try function+F4)<br/></p>\n<p>You're an archive diver that forges cartridges, you try to maximize sales, but the dang bugs get in the way. To make matters worse, they have an absurd sense of hearing and can spot you around corners, and behind them!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.</p>\n<p>X to \"pause\" the game and start a ghost recording to teleport to after releasing X.</p>\n<p>Yes, I'm aware that you have to separate yourself from it by running against a wall, this is intentional so it wouldn't be abused as much.</p>\n<p>Known bugs that I didn't fix in time:</p>\n<p>If you, a point where 2 walls meet, AND an enemy are all sub-pixel perfectly aligned. You can be spotted through the wall. Rare, but possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb9e01e87f722484094eae913317950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrabKing777"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
