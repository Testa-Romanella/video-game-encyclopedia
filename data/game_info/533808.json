No, that is not what happened... <strong>Who said Mice were wiser than humans?</strong></p>\n<p>They didn't wait long before <strong>waging war upon themselves</strong>, using remnants of human technologies to their means.</p>\n<p>MAD MICE is a <strong>1vs1\u00a0</strong><strong>platformer-style strategic versus-fighting game</strong>.</p>\n<p>Embody a <strong>tiny mouse</strong> controlling a <strong>huge fortress</strong> and annihilate your opponent's using a <strong>diverse arsenal</strong>.<br/>Try to overcome chaos and become the <strong>victorious rodent</strong>!</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Attack is the best defence, even for a mouse! <strong>Grab ammunition</strong> at the bottom, <strong>load it in your attack room</strong> and KABOOM!<strong> THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE</strong></p>\n<p>Well, if ANNIHILATING YOUR OPPONENT is taking too long, you will maybe suffer some backfire. Don't worry, <strong>the latest MICE technology got you covered</strong>!<br/><strong>Load a shield battery</strong> in your <strong>defence room</strong>, and watch a pitiful missile hopelessly crash onto it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you run out of options to get rid of your opponent\u00a0through basic means, you can rely on the most strategic device of your fortress: <strong>THE HACKING SYSTEM</strong>.<br/><strong>Allowing you to cancel and prevent the use of an enemy room</strong> for a certain time, it is certainly the most cunning technology on the battlefield!</p>\n<p>We recommend playing with<strong> 2 gamepads</strong>, but you can also play with <strong>2 different keyboard configurations</strong>, arrow keys or ZQSD or WASD.</p>\n\n\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Laurent Mannino  Project Manager</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Baptiste Bourgoin aka \"Raychop\"\u00a0</strong><strong>Game Designer<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Antoine Lima de Carvalho\u00a0\u00a0Game Designer<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clara Toussaint UX Designer &amp; UR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theo Lemoine</strong><strong>\u00a0Gameplay\u00a0Programmer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Foucault</strong><strong>\u00a0Gameplay Programmer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Laetitia Brun Graphic Designer (2D)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Miguel Saura Graphic Designer (3D)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gr\u00e9goire Monesma</strong>\n<strong>Sound Designer &amp; Composer</strong></p>\n<p>All sounds, music, and visual art, or basically any art in this game is <strong>the result of our own work</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks a lot to all our early playtesters</strong> for their numerous feedbacks.
