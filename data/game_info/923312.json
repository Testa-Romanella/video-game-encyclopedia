You know it, but your peers do not. They run from their duties to become tasty seasonings for the great curry. It is up to you to bring these vegetables to justice by any means necessary! Hack, slash, and hunt vegetables, sending them to their maker, and take on the great Daikon to finish the ingredients. Do not let their screams or pleas for mercy stay your blade. Your mistress will have her curry and no vegetable will escape your wrath. Not even you!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Omari Straker - Gameplay programmer<br/>Ray Jackson - Gameplay programmer<br/>Christopher Adams - Puni vegetable models, woman model, all character voices<br/>Darrell Atienza - Daikon Boss Model<br/>Mayra Rivera - Animation / Asset<br/>Florence Yuen - UI vegetable icons</p>\n<p>Happy and Joyful Children by Free Music |\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/fm_freemusic<br/>Music promoted by\u00a0https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>Samura Sak\u00e9 Showdown by Darren Curtis |\u00a0https://www.darrencurtismusic.com/<br/>Music promoted by\u00a0https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f491a9b17f4171ccf4e76f817e5a6c8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["raynistooshort"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
