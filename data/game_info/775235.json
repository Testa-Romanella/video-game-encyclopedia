I'm willing to give away\u00a050$ which will be split\u00a0between one or several winners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are you doing this?\r\nI just want people to try out my game!<br/>I'm fairly new to game development, so I'm obviously not able to create something great yet due to lack of experience.\r\n<br/>\r\nNevertheless, I spend my time and effort on this, so I want somebody to play it.\r\n<br/>\r\nI would be feeling frustrated spending several weeks on the game just to have 0 plays on itch.io\ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\n\r\nOh wow, okay, what are the rules then?\r\nThere are almost no rules except for the two below-mentioned. To participate in the giveaway you need to:\r\n<br/>\r\n1. Have an itch.io account registered before Apr 22, 2022\r\n<br/>\r\n2. Leave a comment under this game below. It doesn't matter what it is going to be (funny comment, feedback, video reaction, it's up to you)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are you going to split the prize?I'm just going to pick several different authors from the comment section\u00a0and split it between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen are you going to do that?\r\nIt depends on how it goes, but I think that\u00a0I'm going to choose winners\u00a0by the end of the May. I'll publish the winners on this page to let you know that giveaway is over.\r\n\r\nHow are you going to pay?\r\nI can't answer this cause I have no idea where the winner could be from.\r\n<br/>\r\nSo I'm going to contact him/her and we will find a way to make a payment (PayPal, Cryptos, Ko-Fi, DonationAlerts, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you going to release more games with $ giveaways?\r\nYeah, this is also planned. So stay tuned and consider following me on itch.io<em>\ud83d\ude09</em>\n<strong>Plot</strong>\r\nYou stayed up late at work.\r\n<br/>\r\nAgain.\r\n<br/>\r\nNow you're hungry and in the bad mood looking for a place to eat.\r\n<br/>\r\nLuckily, you encounter a McDonald\u2019s ... but is it going to be your regular visit?\r\n\r\n<strong>Controls</strong>\r\n\r\nWASD to move", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T08:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a264affd463fe5e83d9238c6db45ae94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0a3r"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
