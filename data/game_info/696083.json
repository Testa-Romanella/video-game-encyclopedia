The story goes through the experiences of a person who is stuck in a loop of nightmares, with no way of getting out. The goal of this game is to &lt;span class=\"MsoSubtleEmphasis\" &lt;deliver=\"\" a=\"\" simple,=\"\" yet=\"\" impactful=\"\" story=\"\" that=\"\" is=\"\" easy=\"\" to=\"\" understand,=\"\" while=\"\" still=\"\" keeping=\"\" player&lt;=\"\" span=\"\"&gt;&gt;span class=\"MsoSubtleEmphasis\"&gt;s interested with its mysteries. The story is compact and ends in a straightforward way while still leaving room for more questions and possibilities. As the creator, I am most happy about how the story looks. I kept the simple aesthetic and interface to make the game easily understandable for anyone.&lt;/span&gt; I think that the images shown in the game perfectly fit the dark theme and feel of the story. I feel that the game has a good balance between picture and text for a story-based game. If there is anything that I think the game can improve on, it would have to be the sound effects. Although the game already has good sound effects that fit the story, I think that it can definitely still improve with more time. I feel that game soundtracks bring the life out of a game. And as the developer, I want the game to feel more natural and alive to the player. Besides that, a few more tweaks here and there on the visuals and pictures, </em><em>and maybe adding more visual effects, would further improve and enhance the game and help achieve the perfect horror experience.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T05:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6f0f34f94eb3a5c43597dfa68a9da40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnRafaelAbuelo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
