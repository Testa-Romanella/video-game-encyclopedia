We discovered it at the famous USATE Tournament, brought it home, and it has become a favorite game at home, and among chess fans at our local chess club\u2026.\u201d<br/><br/>2)  Becca, 12 year old student writes\u2026<br/>\u201cMy family and i love plunderchess!! it is the best ever!! we're always playing it! I used 2 dread it when my family played chess bc 2 me it was boring. but PLUNDERchess, now thats another story. its easy to understand and FUN!\u201d<br/><br/>Here are a few of the BASIC Rules of PlunderChess\u00ae Play:<br/>1) \"Plundering\" occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing piece and \"plunders\" or \"acquires\" additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured, hence, strengthening the capturing piece!  This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called \"vests\") on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.<br/><br/>2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it's very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)<br/><br/>3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a \"trade\") and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)<br/><br/>4) When plundering is elected, a \"colored vest banner\" that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T02:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbac411ff9a82b2b8c60dd8281c8c9e1_yAXhXbf.jpg", "website": "http://www.plunderchess.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["White Horse Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["White Horse Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
