This means <strong>disengaging the engine won't stop the ship</strong>; to do that, you'll have to point the ship the other and then thrust forward.</p>\n<p>Rotation is control via the WASD keys while thrusters are only controlled by the arrow key. <strong>Controlling the ship isn't easy</strong>, but eventually you'll get used to it.\u00a0(It's not like it's rocket science...)</p>\n\r\n Resource Management<p>Your rocket ship will have resources like fuel, oxygen, and energy. You'll have to juggle between these resources and plan missions accordingly.</p><p>If you run out of any of the resources, you'll die.</p>Original Music<p>This game includes original, atmospheric music.</p>Campaign (Planned) \r\n<p>Upgrades can bought with money gained from missions. These upgrades will open up new opportunities and make everything easier.</p>\n<p><strong>If you die, you lose everything.</strong> So try not to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN BETA : Everything is subject to change.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T10:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/456/45601264f302c43498f94c875e194bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lynnlo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
