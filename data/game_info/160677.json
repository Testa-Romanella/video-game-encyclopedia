I hope you enjoy, and tell me what you think.</p><p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Memorize the pattern of the flashing lights and click the buttons in the order you see them light up.</p><p>(The level selection screen is a little bugged so if you try and choose the \"Wacky\u00a0Simon\" game mode it may take you back to the title screen. I am working on a fix, and it shouldn't be long until it works fine.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/516b0d5a38deff701f5459a972c4fcbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Graham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
