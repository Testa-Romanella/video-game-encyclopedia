You need to be quick as you only have a limited amount of time!<br/><br/>As your score increases, so does the difficulty! You'll have less time to tap each tile as you progress further into the game.<br/><br/>Not tapping isn't the only way to result in a game over - tapping anywhere other than the active tile will also result in the dreaded Game Over screen!<br/><br/>Keep playing to earn yourself new high scores! There's built-in Game Centre support too so you'll be able to compete with friends to see who does the best!<br/><br/>Have an Apple Watch? Did you know you can play Tile Tap directly on your wrist too!<br/><br/>If you\u2019d like to keep up-to-date with Tile Tap, why not follow me on social media:<br/><br/>Facebook: www.facebook.com/AdamFootUK/<br/>Twitter (@AdamFootUK): www.twitter.com/AdamFootUK/<br/>Instagram (@AdamFootUK): www.instagram.com/AdamFootUK/<br/><br/>Alternatively, visit my website for information about my other apps or to get in contact with me:<br/><br/>www.adamfoot.uk<br/><br/>Download Tile Tap on your other devices by going to:<br/><br/>www.adamfoot.uk/Tile-Tap", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T04:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f094f3afc3dc8ac6f1fe2d6eaaa5c87f_PXXljBk.jpg", "website": "https://www.adamfoot.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adam Foot"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Adam Foot"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
