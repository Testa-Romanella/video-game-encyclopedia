You have complete control of the ship as the entire crew and colonists are in hibernation chambers. This is not your first run but unknown to you it may be your last. About half way through your flight everything that could go wrong goes wrong. The systems controlling the hibernation chambers have begun to fail, power to the cargo hold is malfunctioning which endangers the future of the colony, the sensors systems are throwing ghost signals all over the place making it difficult to know what is outside the ship, and finally there is a virus running through the ship logs and files deleting any information it can find. You activated the ships emergency beacon and now must try to keep the ship together until rescue arrives. How much of the ship and crew will be left if and when that help comes?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb315b602246f47b1e839c2578362f39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Shannon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
