This is my very first game jam, and I am very pleased that I managed to finish my game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, I spent like 2 and a half days fighting myself about art before giving up, so I had to cut my scope quite a bit. But I am glad that I could at least finish this game.<br/></p>\n<p>It's not the best game ever, and I could not playtest it very much, but it is here for you to try.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing it, and I am looking forward to any feedback that\u00a0 I might receive. Thanks!</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S: Sorry for the UI, really did not have time :P</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: So, I tried the HTML version and experienced enormous Lag. So if you experience the same, please download the game if you can! Thanks!</p><p>EDIT 2: Sooo apparently the spikes don't kill you in this version. Sorry! I'll fix it right after the Jam voting ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d43f7ec597776ee55f09d94318f5e61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Spacejet13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
