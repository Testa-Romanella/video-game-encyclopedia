Good enough to make a grown man whimper.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Massive thanks to VideogamerUK for recording and providing the voices to the characters, and the whole of Videogamer.com for being incredibly nice in general. You guys rock! <em>Links: Website, Youtube, Twitter</em></li>\n<li>Another big thanks to Matt Lees for also recording his lovely voice and sending it to me, especially since his schedule was so busy at the time of asking! If you love his stuff, please take a look at his Patreon. Personally, I believe he deserves all the money he can get. <em>Links: </em><em>Twitter, </em><em>Patreon</em></li>\n<li>Also a thanks to whomever created the Master of Puppets 8-bit music. I found it on Youtube, and no name was given in the description (and the person that uploaded it obviously didn't create it...) I can however provide the link to the video. <em>Links: Youtube</em></li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a43b7ade00c28147de27dbf37695e240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixelbear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
