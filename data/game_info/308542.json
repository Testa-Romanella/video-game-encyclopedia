Follow the ball as it shifts around, hidden beneath a cup, and make the right selection.</p>\n<p>Made in about a weeks worth of afternoons last August. I had just a couple of weeks prior to this made a particularly poor and effortless attempt at making a game, and was kind of disappointed with myself, and so developed this in somewhat of a haze of skittish and unfocussed polishing of a simple concept. I was personally quite proud of the result, but I haven't made a game since, because I felt like lightning struck with this, and I've been afraid of disappointing myself again, by expecting to make something like this a second time.<br/></p>\n<p>Now you get to enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f430d6cffdd05821c16c8824f122d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vostn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
