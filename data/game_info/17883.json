By studying the trajectory of its flight, scientists were able to determine that the asteroid came from the Canis Major constellation.<br/>A special rare earth mineral called \"luxirite\", which is not found in our solar system,was discovered in the fallen fragments. Scientific research of the in credibly rare mineral provided mankind with an incredibly powerful source of energy. Thanks to this discovery, the scientific and technological progress of our civilization took a giant leap forward.<br/>The Sirius Scientific Research Complex was opened with the aim of studying luxirite and understanding how to produce more of it, made significant progress in there search of quantum mechanics, robotics, space technology and energy. A particularly significant breakthrough was the creation of the world's first prototype equantum teleportation device, or a space inversion device.<br/>But over time, the world\u2019s valuable mineral reserves were depleted. People, driven by the desire to obtain a permanent source of luxurite, and open up opportunities to explore remote areas of space, started a project calledthe Colony. The project\u2019s main objective was to find a suitable planet for colonization where it would be possible to establish the industrial production of luxurite. <br/>BTD\u2019s story begins on Earth, when a player find himself in the secret Sirius Research Complex  as a candidate in a team of colonists who are preparing fora space jump to one of the remote planets which can support human life.

With a minimum of equipment and with a limited amount of resources, they went to explore the new world. Their tasks: set up the command center of the colony, collect data about the planet, scout outsources of  luxirite and establish continuous communication with Earth. But things don\u2019t go as planned on the alien planet and the fate of the expedition finds itself under threat ...<br/><br/><br/><strong>1.
