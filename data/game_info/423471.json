Does not work on mobile.</strong></p>\n<p>Hello everyone!</p>\n<p>This is my my eighth upload in a series of a Game-A-Week projects I took under Bennett Foddy's Prototype Studio class at NYU. Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made four years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Becoming a Rainbow Bird is a small experiment that unfortunately went wrong. I tried to make an endless runner but just couldn't get it to feel right. Anyways, you play as a legendary bird who needs to collect stars to complete your rainbow track and bring good luck to everyone.\u00a0Also, gravity is reversed</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Space\u00a0</strong>to jump</li></ul>\n<p>Your objective is to grab 6 stars, each one will give you an extra color in your rainbow.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music or art in this game.</p>\n<p>The art is from Spriters-Resources, the song is from the game Muramasa by Vanillaware.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb31ed5b16869e77ce0cc4abef8674d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
