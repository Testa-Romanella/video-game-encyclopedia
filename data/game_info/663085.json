You start with 10 seconds on the clock, but can increase your time limit though careful card selection.\r\n</p>\n<p>My goal was to create a cleanly executed concept with decent 2D graphics that would satisfy the theme, and I believe I've succeeded. The concept is simple, and I feel like it's a nice game to blow a few minutes with.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2d4ac3644358c2fb76aa17d4746758f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
