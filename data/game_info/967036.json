In this fictional world, you play as a farmer sent to a deserted island to grow crops. While farming, you'll also need to build defense towers to fend off small animals that try to steal your food every night. During the tower defense phase, each cycle rewards you with a new island plot to plan your route and expand your farmland. Along the way. There are many desert islands and stranded islanders in the ocean. After linking them, you can turn the desert into an oasis, rescue the islanders, and receive additional rewards.. Once the defense phase is over, you can exchange your harvested crops for points in the store, which can be used to unlock and upgrade various towers and crops.<br/><br/><strong>Game Overview</strong><br/><br/>At least 5-8 hours of gameplay<br/>2 major game modes<br/>17 unique buildings<br/>15 different types of land plots<br/>8 types of enemies with unique mechanics<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u00b7 Every round offers a random combination of cards, land plots, and enemies, ensuring a controlled yet unpredictable battle experience.<br/><br/>\u00b7 All defensive towers and crop cards have individual tech trees on the periphery, and allow players to adjust the draw probability of cards during battle through deck management.
