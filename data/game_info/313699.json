The shapes are all controlled at the same time, but their environments are not the same, meaning the player must figure out a path through the level that will navigate each shape into the goal at the same time. As the game progresses, the levels progress from having 1 shape to having up to 5 shapes at once, increasing in complexity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designer: Luke Piazza<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: Cole Kersting</p>\n<p>Artist: Keziah Yarnoff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17af4e3d9eaf51507257d92a01cf59a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Draschel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
