And then suddenly, one day how their life changed just by the trade that jack made, which was considered foolish by his mother. \r\n  </p>\n<p>The most interesting thing about the story was the trade made by jack. The kid actually sold the only cow they had, which was also their only source of income, just for those five MAGICAL beans, not thinking twice that he might be scammed by the old man. Also, the second most interesting thing in the story was, every time the giant ate his breakfast and asked for his treasure from his wife, he would look at them for exactly a few minutes and then fall into a deep slumber right at the table every time.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The thing that worked well looks good and that I am happy about is the fact that the foolish trade made by the kid turned out to be a lot helpful for the family. Their suffering days were over just by the first visit to the castle made by jack.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This story also shows that Jack was actually consumed by his greediness which almost caused him to lose his life during his last visit to the castle he would\u2019ve been dead instead of the giant if the giant had not tripped from a boulder while chasing after jack giving him enough time to escape and climb down towards his home.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This story also contains some \u201cWhat if\u2019s\u201d situations or in other words, we could say \u201cchoices\u201d that most kids think while watching any type of story or fairy tale on the internet depending upon their own thinking or imagination.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:02:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e0bb892fc07a7a7b4f4c9d205d39ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wardazeeshan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
