Everyday you'll give quests for up to 4 heroes, that hopefully will fit their skills to get as much reputation as possible. Quests will make your resources change overtime, each one having an individual cost as well as a payback once the quest is done. Your goal is to balance out your daily costs as well as your quests outputs and inputs to never reach 0 in any of them. the more reputation you have, the better the quests will be, until you can give out the final quest, the quest to save us all!<br/></p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n\n<p>`A` - Go Left<br/></p>\n<p>`D` - Go Right</p>\n<p>`E` - Interact</p>\n<p>`Left Mouse Click` - Select the quests to give out</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T17:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa36581a012c6db06aa7634a086f27cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KindiLuv"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
