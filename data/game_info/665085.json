Their current task is indicated by the icon in the bottom left of their screen. Once you've decided what everyone will do, select Do Tasks by the campfire to carry them out.</p>\n<ul><li>Resting will recover some health, but unguarded sleepers may be attacked in the night.</li><li>Guarding will protect your sleepers and supplies, but your guards may have to fight.</li><li>Searching will potentially get you useful supplies and new friends, but searchers may take damage from prowling monsters.</li></ul>\n<p>You can also select Move by the campfire to change locations.
