Creepy yet unsettling this is the\u00a0 story of our main character and his tale through the happenings of this historical tragedy.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>AD/Right arrow and Left arrow - movement</li><li>SPACE - Jump</li><li>SHIFT - Cover ears/Protect from Dancer</li><li>CTRL - Crouch</li><li>I - Inventory</li><li>E - Interact</li><li>1 - Light Torch</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Extras\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you enjoy some historical real facts with a mix of creepy, unrelenting madness, then this game engages a topic that infuses what happened in 1518 with the creation of fictional reasoning that we create in our minds to explain what happened. Why did people die while dancing? Our lack of understanding tries to find a reason for it and can only imagine a demonic possession of some sort. This game will use that fear and unease to make the player question if dancing is truly happy or if it is a possessed act that needs to be exorcised.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the story about a plague \u00a0that is very uncanny and underrated for all the lovers of creepy stuff , it deals with serious themes like mass histery , death and poverty, I highly advice if you are interested to check or read about this plague on the internet, if not just play and enjoy the game. This is also the 1 of a 3 part game if people enjoy it ,might make all of them\u00a0.
