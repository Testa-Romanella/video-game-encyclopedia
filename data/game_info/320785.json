You use this power to sneak into secure areas, avoid traps/enemies,\u00a0and steal valuable items. As stealth was the main focus during the development process, there is currently no combat system implemented, but there are plans for that and other features.\u00a0<br/><br/>Shadow Redux is the result of a school project. This demo is a look into what one of the levels of the full game could look like, with the main shadow power implemented. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T04:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c131ad0fdcbc8873bc2ffe0f98a3e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Continental"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
