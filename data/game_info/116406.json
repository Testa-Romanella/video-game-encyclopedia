This is to imitate the feelings experienced from performing ritualistic acts, repetition, and spiral of frustration felt from sinking further into depression.</p><p>It's an interactive story made using the Twine Engine for Global Game Jam 2016. The theme was \"RITUAL\" and this was a solo project, made in less than 10 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50f4df7a767b4634137935a25f4a42a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FutureStateMachine"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
