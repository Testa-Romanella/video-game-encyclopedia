It's pitch dark this night for some reason. The car stalled, so the character must arm with his only flashlight and try to reach his home by following the trail... while the phantoms are ready to send him to the afterlife.</p>\n<p>P.S.: The Darkness of Fear is my first own project made in Godot. I made it in 7 days. The game is small and hardly can I say it has much content or interesting things, yet it is just important for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b780f9459275b34a61bb314b8e21a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chappi044"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
