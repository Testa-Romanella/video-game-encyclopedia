My name is Dias, and I was once a financial advisor, to a notorious Mexican drug cartel. But that life now seems like a distant memory.</p>\n<p>The Earth has been destroyed, by an alien invasion and humans have been living underground, for many years. But just a few days ago, the International Space Agency, announced that it will give spaceships to those who carry gold so that they can escape to the planet Mars, and save themselves from the Aliens. For this, the cartel assigned me a terrifying mission. I have been trapped in this dense and unforgiving forest because my fingerprint is the only one, that can unlock 12 ATM machines, that have gold plates stored inside. If I unlock them and hand them over to the cartel, they will free my beloved wife Athena and my only son Hermes, who they are holding prisoner, and give us a spaceship so we can go to the planet Mars.</p>\n\n<p>The mission is as follows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Facts:</p>\n<p>1) ATMs have red lights, that can only be seen at night by looking up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) During the day, the red lights are invisible</p>\n<p>3) There is a risk of getting lost in the dense forest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quest:</p>\n<p>a) You\u00a0need to find a compass, so I don't get lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) You\u00a0need to find and unlock all the 12 ATMs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) You have to survive the Alien Robots without Guns or any Defence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4) You\u00a0have to find where the spaceship will appear with your family and escape from Earth.</p>\n\n<p>\" My love, I promise, I will come to save you \"</p>\n<p>Follow me on\u00a0Twitter for Future Games\u00a0: https://twitter.com/ANGELISMPEKIARI</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090187808759</p>\n<p>Website: https://dynertia.eu/</p>\n<p>#adventuregame #gamedev\u00a0#gamedesign #indiegame #gaming #pcgaming #puzzlegame #fantasyart #scifi #gamedevelopment #upcoming #Dynertia #DynertiaStudios<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T14:00:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae69de2e5cc3d8d250b55d86df832cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Angelis Bekiaris"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
