When an Amazin delivery truck arrives, quickly pickup the boxes and stack them on the floor over one of the green glowing indicators or another box. Boxes of the same type can be combined up to three times to take up less vertical space and award more points, while different products will only stack on top of each other.</p>\n<p>GameOVER if the delivery van hits a previously delivered box!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/>Move - left (A) / right (D)<br/>Jump \u2013 Space<br/>Aim \u2013 Mouse cursor<br/>Pickup / Drop \u2013 Left click</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/27130c17f7f6f9632eb411f53e9d0d67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crazy Minnow Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
