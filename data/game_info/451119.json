For this time I do all scripts and graphism for my game. I wanted to try digital painting and it was difficult but I learned a lot of thing and I appreciated to create all my game alone. Except for the sound and the music, I don't have the skill for that for the moment :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>My game is hard to finish, I hope you have determination to get victory ! Be brave soldier or you will die in this cave !\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can found my sounds and the music in these sound banks here :<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://www.auboutdufil.com/index.php?tag=8-bit<br/>https://lasonotheque.org/detail-0237-cris-et-applaudissements-d-ados-2.html<br/>https://lasonotheque.org/detail-0477-cri-wilhelm.html</p>\n\n<p>When I uploaded my game, I saw that resolution problems are presents. For some screens, player can't see everything and so he can't play. Therefore, I have created another version for\u00a0lower resolution of screen. If you can play with the original game it is better !<br/>\u00a0<br/>Resolution of original game is 960x960<br/>Resolution of 2nd version\u00a0is 480x480</p>\n<p>Enjoy !\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:35:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49c1478583c87414ae581972c36ee3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kynokaze"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
