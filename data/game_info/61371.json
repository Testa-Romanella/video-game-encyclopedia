Chest and enemy spawn points and quantities are randomized for every level as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRogue Party brings the anticipation of random dungeon crawling to the next level with a highly interactive multiplayer experience. Work together by using potions on one another, exploiting enemy weaknesses and building your equipment to complement the team.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOr go it alone, taking on the Dungeon of Doom all by yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Drop in, Drop Out\" multiplayer features mean that your friends can join at any time during the first level of the game and, if anyone quits, the adventure can continue unaffected.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery door could lead to a mundane hallway, epic room full of loot or a soul crushing boss.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a0afe02e4dd61ea960bf974322654f.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMHsplynD8zX7NqcvdV8CQ", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Antoni"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chris Antoni"], "esrb_rating": null}
