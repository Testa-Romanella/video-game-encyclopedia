In it\u2019s current stage, it has a fairly minimalist aesthetic.</p>\n\n<p>One player at a time takes control of the crown. They then aim and rain fire on the remaining players using using the four weapon types: SHOT, BLAST, BEAM, and ZONE.</p>\n\n<p><em>gifs are not representative of in-game framerate and image quality</em></p>\n<p>The crowned player can also deploy and trigger bombs which also change depending on the weapon type.</p>\n\n<p>The attacking player will move faster within a defensive players\u2019 soul shield, but won't be able to initiate attacks. The defensive players will still have their work cut out for them though, only being able to take 3 hits.</p>\n\n<p>Once the time limit is up however, the crowned player will be expelled, and a new player can rise up to take their place. The last one standing wins!</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s it for now. This is an early prototype,\u00a0 and it may or may not be improved upon in the future.\u00a0\u00a0More abilities and game modes are planned for the future.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Requires at least 1 controller. Keyboard control is possible but not recommended.\u00a0</p><p>Version Changes</p><p>v0.4</p><p>-First upload. See above for all features</p><p>v0.5</p><p>-Added color switching. You can now use the shoulder buttons to change the color of your projectiles. Each color has special effects (only one new color for now).</p><p>-Added Orange /blue color.\u00a0 You can move through orange attacks and stay still in blue attacks. Each is more powerful, however, than a regular attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/411/4115ab0367b28faaa55b4fd1ecfd65b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Massimog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
