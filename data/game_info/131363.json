Click on a tile to select it, click on it a second time to deselect it, click on action phase to make the cube spawn and roll their way towards the targets with your help... or not ;)</p>\n<p>Anyway, Enjoy and have fun!    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c3fb3a7a20f31d9d0bbfca04f4eb9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameDevDragon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
