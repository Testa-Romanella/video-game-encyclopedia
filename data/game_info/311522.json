Follow this 7 minute dating simulator, over the span of 3 days, where you'll meet three boys, and have fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was originally created in December, but I never went to make an anonymous\u00a0\u00a0download link for it. The storyline is pretty short, and I'm not really proud of Latvia and Lithuania's sprites. Estonia's sprites are actually from one of my upcoming games, 5 Nordic Friends. Hope you have fun, and I may just reboot the game, with a longer storyline. Thanks for everything!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T05:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/461e92460f34ee29f14cbbf290535994.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["aphinternet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
