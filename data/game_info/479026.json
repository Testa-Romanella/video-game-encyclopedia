You can use the thread in-game to rewind your age back to an adult or even a child. You can also wind the thread forward to become older again.</p>\n<p>The programming was done by OxygenDaemon. All the visuals were made by Magia Lilium. Any other assets like music and fonts are used with open license or are available in the public domain. All right remain with their respective holders.</p>\n<p>This was our first game released to the public, we realize we made many faults along the way and would love to receive feedback</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4ea158087a459de45fef1da1d7cab1f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OxygenDaemon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
