This is a resource and time management sim, where the player  takes control of two characters, and needs to run a coffee shop.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Key  bindings can be changed in the settings from the main menu. W, A, S and  D are default movement keys. E to toggle between characters. Space to  interact with customers and other things. <br/></p>\n<p>There seems to be a <em><strong>bug</strong></em>, which causes <strong>Space </strong>to be bound to Pause action for some people. Please take a look at <strong>Settings &gt; Keyboard</strong> before starting a game, and sorry for the inconvenience.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>During the day customers will arrive to your shop. Ask them what they need and use your stations behind the counter to prepare their order. All actions take time, and that's why there's two of you! Toggle between characters to multi-task. Try to match customers' orders as close as possible to get the best payout and tips.</p>\n<p>If customers aren't served fast enough they'll leave. There's no penalty for customer leaving, other than a grumpy face and a loss of a couple of bucks. There's no yelp in this world yet.</p>\n<p>Once the day ends, and the last customer has left, your hardworking baristas will go to sleep. You'll be able to review your day's profits and restock missing items. Yup, items do run out, so don't forget to buy some coffee every day!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/148c1e1a89cf67c1fb0f1333c1d77946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Dmitriy Shmilo", "adamastor_sol", "Jon Herbst"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
