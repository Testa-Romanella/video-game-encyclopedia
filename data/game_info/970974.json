Our goal is to kill the enemies and find the end of the game throughout the episode based game. Another FPS Game, which criticizes many video games, approaches other action games through the eyes of an independent producer. We try to survive, fight zombies, fear and end the game by fighting zombies again. It has a structure that blends humor with its unique graphic style, simple and understandable gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/> <strong>Don't remember, this game will make you a maid!</strong><br/><br/>     After millions of billions of dollars and decades of development, we have accomplished everything that can happen in a game. Another FPS Game has opened a new era to the game history, not a new breath.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T01:07:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c2/7c24a2704adf6cac787edc6da8a0929b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akustiyal Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Akustiyal Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
