Use this to your advantage!</p>\n<p>Time your attacks! Only the spear tip does\u00a0damage so if the enemy gets too close you can't hurt them!</p>\n<p>There is a brief period where you can't avoid enemies while attacking\u00a0so don't spam attacks!</p>\n<p>You have a wide overhead swing, but are vulnerable from below.
