You may find the text hard to read at points, but please understand that that is intentional. Likewise, there is no sound, so please play whatever soundtrack you like and imagine whatever sound effects you like.<br/></p>\n<p>I may update this game in the future if there's enough of a response to it, as there were some things I wanted to put in that I just flat out ran out of time for. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/269543ce143b78f988ec68967ea6539e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
