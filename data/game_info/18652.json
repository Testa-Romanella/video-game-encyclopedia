A maze is randomly generated, forever in every direction. Hidden in the maze are lots of gems to collect! There are also special things to find while exploring, like statues or other interesting rooms. You can teleport or move freely. There are no monsters, traps, or any sort of danger, and you can choose to play by sunlight or moonlight, whichever you prefer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b842729b269f00bd398e97d47bbed03e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Prosser"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Mike Prosser"], "esrb_rating": null}
