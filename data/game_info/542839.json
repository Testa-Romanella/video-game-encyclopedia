The last one standing is the winner.<br/><br/><strong>You are always the snake in the game.</strong> The other player is always the Dog.</p>\n<p>The game works using my own small matchmaker server; it's a simple queue of players, and it sets up players in pairs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:53:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f292bc2a99b1415fec33ee6b08648f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["perons"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
