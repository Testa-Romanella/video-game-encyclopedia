To play and experience this game, it is advised to use https://3xr.space\u00a0website.</p>\n<p>This game is a <strong>multi-user virtual world</strong> in which players compete to become owners of the <strong>pixel art canvas</strong> (which is an actual NFT).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The goal is simple</strong>. Shoot the pixel canvas to\u00a0mirror the right side of the pixel board on the left side.</p>\n<p>All players share the same state of the pixel canvas and the <strong>winner </strong>is the one that completes the mirroring\u00a0- submitting the last correct pixel(s). Once this happens,\u00a0the smart contract will randomly generate a new pattern and a\u00a0<strong>new round</strong> starts.</p>\n<p><strong>What if you're already the owner?\u00a0</strong>If you're already\u00a0the owner, sabotage others by submitting colors to wrong positions. Only colors submitted to the left panel count.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The color of your shooter changes every <strong>5 seconds </strong>and cycles through the rainbow colors (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red).\u00a0<strong>The cool part is </strong>you'll be able to see others wandering around, but you don't know which colors they have - but <strong>you can try to\u00a0guess</strong>!</p>\n<p>You can find who is the current owner on the wall and some other stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Shoot the pixel canvas to start<ul><li>If you're not connected, you'll be redirected to NEAR wallet to connect your account</li></ul></li><li>Use <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>arrows</strong> for navigation</li><li>Press the <strong>right mouse button</strong> or\u00a0<strong>E</strong> to shoot</li><li>Look around to aim with your mouse</li><li>Pressing <strong>F</strong>\u00a0toggles <strong>fly mode</strong>. You might need to block some player's vision, I guess.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Few caveats</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The blockchain state is fetched\u00a0<strong>every 5 seconds\u00a0</strong>and refreshes all pixels, so the colors you shot\u00a0<strong>may disappear</strong>\u00a0from the canvas until they're effectively validated on the smart contract side.<br/>\n</li><li>This is a multi-user virtual world and the number of concurrent players wasn't capped. So... let's hope for the best, right?!<ul><li>Check the number of concurrent players by visiting:\u00a0https://three-xr-socket-server.herokuapp.com/room/ownly1</li></ul></li><li>VR is supported but not well tested throughout this jam</li><li>Transactions are sent every time the color switches.</li><li>Sometimes images don't load, if this happens reload the page.</li><li>This game takes advantage of NEAR's access keys system. Every transaction uses a little bit of your allowance. When you've ran out of allowance, the game will clear Local Storage forcing you to create a new connection on NEAR wallet.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Technology used</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>IPFS</strong>: All game assets and javascript files are stored on IPFS via\u00a0<strong>Pinata Cloud</strong>\n</li><li><strong>NEAR</strong>: The NFT and game logic is deployed as a smart contract on NEAR.
