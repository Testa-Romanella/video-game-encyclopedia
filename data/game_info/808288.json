But you gotta look at your screen because that's where your work is - programming, drawing and submitting your finished work!<br/></p>\n<p>All hazards announce themselves with sound and visuals - watch out for cues to get away from your computer and dodge. Don't forget you can hold \"up\" to jump higher.</p>\n\n<p>This is a game I made for a small jam in 3 days.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is short, but very challenging. My fastest time is 1:57.014. Can you beat it?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T16:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511f9786c7a308e674c79d24c14bd9c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Don Tnowe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
