Thank you for clicking in.<br/><br/>All members of the One-Time Society are high school seniors. After completing this game, all members will leave their hometown and scatter around the world.<br/><br/>So we mock ourselves and say that during our one-time high school graduation vacation, we gather together and play a one-time game that everyone will never open again after watching it. That's what we call a one-time club.<br/><br/>The production process is very realistic, and the script for \"Trapped Beast in a Cage\" was chosen more because it has fewer characters and can be completed in less than three months. The graduation vacation is not so idle, and the technical level is average among peers.<br/><br/>The script is too short, the art resources are limited, and we don't have our own music, but we still managed to create it. Even if it was a one-time event, the one-time club completed its mission. Just like \"Trapped Beast in a Cage\" transformed from a school life novel to an FDS of many places, everyone in the one-time society has a new identity and a story.<br/><br/>And the people of the disposable society are not disposable, and everyone who may or may not reunite will definitely have better and better works.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:08:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c143c7b7f6ecaad041669419bb7d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u793e"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u793e"], "esrb_rating": null}
