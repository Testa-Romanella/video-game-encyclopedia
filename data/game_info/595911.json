It will be progressing as weeks pass by.</p>\n<p>Currently, the level block-out is fleshed out with all of the jump obstacles in place, and the liquid-darkness material is in place at the bottom. Notably, the textures and materials are subject to change, the lighting in the level right now are only temporary quick-fills, and there is no sound. It is VERY early in the development process.</p>\n<p>There IS a lose condition (falling into the darkness), however, there is NOT a win condition as of yet. There is a place-marker for where the collectable win condition will be; however, other than that it is not very developed. Right now, I'm working towards a first playable, which I will consider to be a reached goal once the win condition is implemented, and I get the animation for the 'Darkness Rising' for which the game was named, to function properly. (Thank you for your patience, and any feedback you have will be greatly appreciated).\u00a0 email is jb110598@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Goals after the first playable are getting the score working for players to track their progress \"high-scores,\" implementing sound for non-diegetic background music, as well as voice-over instructions to guide players past check-markers and obstacles, as well as making it so that players can't climb up the asymmetrical walls of the tower.</p>\n<p>Once that's done, all that will be left, quite literally, is optimizing the speed of the rising darkness to improve the gameplay feel, and optimizing finalized lighting/art within the game itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3adbfe4df878597eecc00c90376698d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBrauer98"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
