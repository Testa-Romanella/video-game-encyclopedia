In this tower defense game, you influence the monsters path. They all want to get to the door to push the dwarves out of the depths. Your goal is to make sure no monsters reach your door, and keep your dwarven empire safe, so we can continue to mine for shiny objects.    <br/><br/><h3>7 Unique towers, 1 barricade</h3>Each tower has their own strengths and weaknesses, so make sure you plan out where to place your towers, to reach the maximum efficiency. <br/>The 7 towers all have unique upgrades that will make them even stronger in the level. Give your favorite Sniper tower critical strike, give your best placed Cooling tower a chance to completely freeze the enemy, or focus on your economy by upgrading the Drill to continuously give you income.    <br/><br/><h3>Different every time</h3>Every level is procedurally generated, to give you a unique experience every time you play the game. Select the difficulty, the spawners and the waves and begin stopping monsters from reaching your door. Each time you play, you get a seed, and that seed will always generate the same setup. If you've found the perfect seed, you can replay that level with the seed, and even share it so others can enjoy it as well.  <br/><br/><h3>Challenge your playstyle</h3>A wide array of unique monsters will challenge your tower setup, some with abilities specifically designed to make you rethink how you place your towers. Armored enemies will require hard-hitting towers, massive waves of enemies will require you to think-in area of effect towers, and some might even disrupt your towers forcing you to spread out your defenses.<h3>Features </h3><ul><li> <strong>Procedurally generated</strong> levels &amp; waves, giving a unique experience on every play<br/></li><li> <strong>7 towers</strong> with unique upgrades to fit your playstyle<br/></li><li> A wide array of <strong>monsters</strong>, some with abilities<br/></li><li> <strong>Bosses </strong>with unique abilities<br/></li><li> <strong>Mazing</strong> allowing you to influence the path of the monsters<br/></li><li> <strong>Achievements</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T07:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04bff094c8057f66de3c1477609ae301.jpg", "website": "https://mellowpenguin.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mellow Penguin Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mellow Penguin Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
