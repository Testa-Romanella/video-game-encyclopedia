Defeat the enemy captain, scuttle their ship, plunder enough booty or end up shark bait in Davy Jones\u2019 Locker!\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are two rival crews in Plunder Panic, each consisting of 1 to 6 players who take on the role of either a captain or a crew mate.\u00a0Armed with a cutlass, captains can kill enemy players and cut cannon fuses to disarm them. Killing the enemy captain a certain number of times ends the game.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Crew members can plunder gold and return it to their crew\u2019s treasure chest, once they get enough gold they can sail away.\u00a0Crew members can also purchase a cutlass to earn the ability to attack and battle with enemy captains and opposing crews.\u00a0Crew members can load cannon balls into a cannon, which needs to hit the enemy ship 3 times to sink it.\u00a0Or crews can compete to row a dinghy full of explosives toward the enemy ship, if it reaches the bow of the ship, it\u2019ll instantly sink!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Plunder Panic is balanced for both casual pick-up games with asymmetrical teams like 5 vs. 4 or tournament style teams like 3 vs. 3 up to 6 vs. 6. It includes multiple game modes like Free Play, Tournament, Conquest (where you have to complete each objective to win the game), and an \u201cAll Captains\u201d mode where each crew fights to the death! Additional modify-arrs and items allow for even more customizable play.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Our team is continuing to develop Plunder Panic and is exploring things like more power-ups, levels, and game modes, as well as AI bots and networked multiplayer. These features may or may not make it into the final release. Due to requests from our loyal fans, we wanted to make the current version available now via early access!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The early access release is sold as, there be no returns for this booty, but this chest be full of endless fun. We will provide early access updates via this itch.io store page. The final version may or may not be available via itch.io, but\u00a0the final PC/Mac\u00a0release will be made available to itch.io early access purchasers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Awards and Appearances</strong></p>\n<p>The game debuted at\u00a0IndieCade\u00a0in October 2017 in Los Angeles and received the\u00a0Audience Choice Award.
