It's been made in 10 days. All graphics, sounds, programming done by me, except for a couple of free-to-use fonts:</p>\n<p>- smallburg, by GGBotNet:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/smallburg.font</p>\n<p>- VCR OSD Mono Font, by Riciery Leal :\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font</p>\n<p>You can play this game either windowed or full-screen, through your browser.</p>\n<p>This game was developed using Unity. I also used a free-to-use, general purpose library I've created in C#:\u00a0https://github.com/ConradoClark/Licht.</p>\n<p>The full source code of this game is available here:\u00a0https://github.com/ConradoClark/bullethelljam2022-faecula</p>\n<p>This game's control scheme is <strong>Mouse-Only</strong>. (no keys, no gamepad, no touch, sorry!)</p>\n<p>General Advice:</p>\n<p>- The game holds your hand in the beginning to show you the commands (knock, look, interact) and the bullet hell stages. After the first bullet hell stage, you are encouraged to experiment and use all your actions\u00a0on the objects you see on the screen.</p>\n<p>- This game has a total of 3 bullet hell encounters. I suggest everyone to find them all! Not all of them are required to finish the game but they can provide some challenge.</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy this little game, I had a great time participating in the game jam.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: Though this game is pretty tame in visual effects, the screen flashes at certain moments, please be warned if you have any kind of photosensitivity issues.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e8/2e8e51a8125f1f44080f61929252ecf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ConradoClark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
