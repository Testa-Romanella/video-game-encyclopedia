Solstice is not a remake of any of these games but takes its lead from these games to develop a new gaming challenge for lovers of turn-based, menu driven strategy. Displayed using hand-drawn artwork, and using a pseudo-3D technique, often referred to as landscaping, which echoes the games of the time.<br/></p>\n<p>Set in the mythical land of Dourfrost, a land, trapped in an eternal winter, a land of fantastic beasts, magic and war,<br/><br/>Explore and battle across an open world, populated with 11 different mythical races (at launch), and well over a hundred and twenty characters, each with his or her likes, dislikes, needs, aims, desires and loyalties that shape the game and conflicts to come.<br/><br/>On release, Solstice will feature one very challenging, turn-based scenario, offering many hours of game-play.<br/><br/><strong>The Rise of the Demon King.</strong><br/><br/>While the lords and ladies of Dourfrost have squabbled over petty disputes and brokered and broken pacts and alliances, a dark power has been rising in the south. A power that will shake the entire land and threatens to overwhelm all that stands before it, and enslave everyone in its path.<br/><br/>Sator Grimward, a dark sorcerer, once thought long defeated, has risen again and united the tribes of the Ice Guard. Can Calith, king of the free folk muster the lords and ladies of Dourfrost, and overcome old bitterness, to bring a force of Freefolk, Dwarfs, Fey, Sidhe, Giants, and 6 other races together to defeat the rising storm.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:41:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e69dee5c4d097e76b8774c0438bab0ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimJamsGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
