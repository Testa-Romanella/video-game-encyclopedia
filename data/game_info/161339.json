This is just a prototype, so while most of the core mechanics work,\u00a0 the puzzles are very simple, and some things like doors opening only when the puzzle is completed have not been fully implemented. However, I'm quite proud of the concept, and the amount of work I put into the project then.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/22801b6e627e4b6b605de07b377b04e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
