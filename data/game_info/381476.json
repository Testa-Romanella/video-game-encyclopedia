Which means if you walk outside the bounds of the map...... You better come back. There's really nothing else there, I promise.</li><li>Clicking on the letters for the password can be laggy, so make sure you click thoroughly on each of the keys. Try again until something changes.</li><li>The music sometimes takes a while to start. But it will eventually start (<strong>source:</strong>\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZEPeyR4Z3g).</li><li>Sometimes the last page won't appear after encoding the password. You just gotta refresh and try again....!</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e03bcfb915edcea528bb46a1bcf6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rumy"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
