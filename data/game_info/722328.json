Then I didn't get it finished on time. So I\u00a0popped in the next weeks theme. And...that repeated for two months. 'Til I\u00a0got it just about finished recently...buuut added two more haha. Has possibly ended up being my biggest project so far due to this, which is kinda neat. Despite probably being a bit all over the place. But I'm glad it's mostly done from the looks, despite a few graphical errors here and there. And I buggered up a few of the usernames which I\u00a0needa go back and fix. As well as other stuff I've probably missed buuut it's there's enough to play haha.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I\u00a0wasn't able to get a web version goin' due to a few errors I needa fix up with the GBStudio software I, so only the Game Boy ROM's available.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of the (so so many, oof)\u00a0themes and weeks covered too:</p>\n<p><strong>October 5th - 12th:\u00a0Draw Yours (Or Anyones) Twitch Username</strong></p>\n<p><strong>October 12th - 19th:\u00a0Tarot Cart Designs</strong></p>\n<p><strong>October 19th - 26th: Potions</strong></p>\n<p><strong>October 26th - November 2nd: Fantasy Landscapes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>November 2nd\u00a0- November 9th: Ocean Floor</strong></p>\n<p><strong>November 9th - November 16th: Mythical Pets</strong></p>\n<p><strong>November 16th - November 23rd: Pareidolia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>November 23rd - November 30th: Shadows</strong></p><p>I still need to add more to this description, like music file credits and an edited video of when the game was played live on stream but I\u00a0will add a link to\u00a0suitntie22's brilliant F-Zero P, which was the framework for the gameplay of Weakly Themes.
