Whether you liked it or hated it, I'd love to know so and why so I can make a better project :)<br/><br/><strong>What is this game:\u00a0</strong>It is a fan game, based on a fictional world made from the videos of the Unus Annus youtube channel. You walk around an abandoned location full of identical rooms and hallways, locating keycards for undisclosed\u00a0reasons, avoiding the Watchers eyesight (lights). Notes can be located for a bit of lore, most of which are references from my favorite videos from the Unus Annus you-tube channel. One note is kind of hidden, let me know if you find it ;)</p>\n<p><strong>What is Unus Annus:</strong> It is a youtube channel made by\u00a0Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and\u00a0Ethan Nestor (CrankGameplays). The idea of the channel is living life to the fullest, and to see what they could do in a single year with daily uploads. The channel will be deleted Friday, November 13th, 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait, what?</strong> The channel was made with the intention to be\u00a0deleted after 1 year of life, the idea being if you had one year to live would you live it to your last? Each day a video was uploaded and periodically fans could interact with the channel through contests and other means via Twitter. My game will also be deleted on this day.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>But why than are you uploading this so late?</strong> The original time table scheduled this game to be uploaded October 25th, 2020 and in a vastly more complicated state. Alas, problem after problem arose with the code preventing that outcome... with no small part being due to my own miss-management of my time.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>So than why upload this at all?\u00a0</strong>To prove to myself that I could make an Unus Annus fan game, before the end of the channel's life. This is my first game, after 8 years of doing nothing with my college education (in game programming), I realized that I do not have forever. Game Development has been my dream since grade 4, and yet I'm now 30 with no progress made. I had to prove, to myself, that I possessed at\u00a0least the core competencies required to begin improvement.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Why is there no audio?</strong> I have never worked with sound before, and one of the cut ideas was sound sadly. It is my deepest regret with the project, as well as the other ideas I had (more enemies, camera shaking, a variety of rooms, dozens upon dozens of notes with stories and many more).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I hope you will take the chance to enjoy it, and if you haven't heard of Unus Annus I suggest checking it out. Even if you cannot watch all the content, you can experience what it is before it's end. You can also join the Unus Annus community on Friday during their Livestream where they will delete the channel live and I believe look at fan art as well. If you have any feedback I'd love to hear it!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I am not affiliated with Ethan or Mark in anyway, this is purely a work of passion as a fan as a thank you to them and the Unus Annus community.</p>\n<p>Thank you Ethan and Mark, for igniting my motivation to make games. Thank you for being a positive influence in my life, your content has helped me cope with my depression, anxiety and fears. If you see this, thank you. If you play this, I hope you enjoy it for what it is. A thank you to you, and this community. I love you all.</p>\n<p>Sincerely;</p>\n<p>Chris M (PositiveThumbGaming)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T06:07:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926edec4f96cde5d114d3a6c8563d158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PositiveThumbGaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
