{"id": 945452, "slug": "autoguild", "name": "Autoguild", "name_original": "Autoguild", "description": "<p><strong>Autoguild</strong> is an <strong>RPG Auto-Battler</strong> strategy game where you progress and level up a guild of characters, heavily inspired by <em>Hearthstone: Battlegrounds</em>. The browser version is very choppy, but if you want, the windows version will run smoother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is very unfinished, as per the <strong>DEMO</strong> on the menu. Balance can be all over the place, and is <strong>subject to crash</strong>. One ability I know for certain that causes many crashes is <strong>ICE BINDING </strong>and<strong> ICE SHIELD</strong>. If you find anything breaking or wrong feel free to post it, however I don't plan on furthering the development of this game. Nevertheless hopefully it provided some amount of enjoyment to any of you. <strong>TYTYTY &lt;3</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69dafbcad237bfd1eaf99f0181c66a03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BluR"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
