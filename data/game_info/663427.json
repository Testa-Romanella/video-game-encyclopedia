Keeping it really simple with this one. I have been playing Dragon Quest IV, so honestly I just wanted to make a Dragon Quest text box.<br/></p>\n<p>Story: You are Rod Wizard, the Master of the Rod. You have cast a spell that has trapped a bunch of wizards in a pocket dimension for all eternity. There's not much you can do about it, so you just wander around and hang out I guess. There's a lot of lore of course I didn't just come up with all this story in 2 minutes. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Use WASD or arrow keys to move around and Space to jump. I think there's gamepad support but I didn't test it. Enjoy(?)</p>\n<p>\"At least you can move the camera and the character at the same time.\" -- World's #1 Wizard Dimension Fan<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3da820beab4427e5c94cbef799e5d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["audioBusting"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
