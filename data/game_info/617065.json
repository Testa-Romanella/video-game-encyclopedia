Getting to the family spiritual altar means crossing foggy chasms. Luckily, the ancient art of astral projection allows Glenn to<em>\u00a0join together </em>with any <strong>spirit stone</strong> and <strong>swap places</strong>; however, that connection can be broken by the troublesome birds and bees. Glenn must avoid his natural foes to make it to his family reunion!</p><p><em>[Challenge Mode: Plenty of spirit stones are scattered as checkpoints. There are plenty of ways to make it across the chasms... but perhaps there even exists some route to get all the way through in one meditation?]</em><br/></p>\r\n--Controls--\r\n<p>[ WASD ] - move around / direct your astral projection</p>\n<p>[ space ] - enter meditation mode and cast your astral projection</p>\r\n--Bug Notes--\r\n<p>- There are no boundaries on the left and right of screen, just... stay within the camera if you want the intended experience<br/>- There are also Bees off screen so...</p>\r\n--Bug Facts--\r\n<p>- All worker bees are female<br/>-Queen bees can lay up to 3000 eggs in a day (wow!)</p>\r\n--Credits--\r\n<p>All characters, story content,\u00a0art, and music assets are<br/>original and are\u00a0(c) FishChiesa, Danguin, and ManlyManton</p>\r\n--Tools--\r\n<p>Game Engine: \u00a0Unity<br/>Art programs:\u00a0 Medibang<br/>Music program:\u00a0 MuseScore, Audacity<br/></p>\r\n--Misc.--<p>Phew... 48 hour game jams are tough but we are very happy with the art, programming, brainstorming, and coding that we put into the time we had to work on this.
