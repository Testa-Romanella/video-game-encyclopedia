{"id": 969657, "slug": "brickbuilder-vr", "name": "Brickbuilder VR", "name_original": "Brickbuilder VR", "description": "Brickbuilder VR is a high-fidelity VR model building simulator. With both decorative blocks and mechanical components such as axels, gears and motors, the game enables you to build a wide variety of interesting creations that move and interact with each other in the virtual world. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrickbuilder VR features 2 primary modes of play: \"blueprints\", which lets you re-create structures that we have designed, and \"freeform\", which is building from a blank slate. At launch, Brickbuilder VR includes 10 blueprints. More will be added as we add more features and content to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is also designed with extensions in mind: it will be possible to create a blueprint from an existing build directly from within the game. We will also release an official SDK, which will provide the functionality to create custom pieces, 3D models, and textures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrickbuilder VR is at an early stage of its development. In addition to performance improvements, UI-overhauls, and bug fixes, we plan to add the following features to the game in the future: pistons / linear actuators; lights; sensors and graph programmability; script programmability; propellers / flying interactions; magnetic joints; and many more. Your support will help us make these a reality.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T15:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f61ede50f6c7b0ae2286c4f98fb0aeb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tempsutido,LLC"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tempsutido,LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
