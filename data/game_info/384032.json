This game is designed to bring the two closer together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself is meant to be put on as a miniature, improvisational play. But unlike typical theater, the game is not meant to tell the whole of a story. Rather, the goal is to tell, to show, what that story looks like experienced through the eyes of the different characters, all of whom are on the outside of the principal narrative.</p>\n<p>The characters themselves, over-the-top caricatures drawn from Commedia Dell\u2019Arte are not part of the main plot at all. No one will play the Rich Uncle, or the Scheming Mama, or the Crafty Merchant. Rather, the players are people on the periphery, who have watched the story move forward and are reacting to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story is built in the absence of the key players, through the ways the player characters respond to them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/3161f2cf3e9167fcfd975fa37b933411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Law of Names Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
