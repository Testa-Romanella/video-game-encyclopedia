Managing your hunger- spelling shorter words drains your stamina- is a satisfying motivator. The abilities and items cover good ground and support the core resource management and the enemies may not have a variety of skills, but they feel different due to what words they are able to spell.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Controls Quick Reference</strong></p>\r\na-zEnter Letter<br/>spaceSwap typing directionbackspaceDelete last letterenterPlay word\r\n<p>Created for the 2022 7 Day Roguelike Jam</p>\n\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Why is this word in the dictionary?</li></ul>\n<p>Spellgeon is currently using a very permissive word list that includes some non-dictionary words, including some common abbreviations.
