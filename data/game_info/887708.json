We are <strong>Mr. Trees.</strong><br/>Welcome to <strong>Finn's</strong> life! We've been waiting in this forest for decades, but finally we found someone to tell. Now you're here, you can listen to <strong>Finn's</strong> story!<br/><br/><strong>Finn,</strong> a high school student, lives in a town with his <strong>mother and friends.</strong>(She makes very nice pies.)<br/>We remember him even as a child. He was a sweetheart! Unfortunately, he didn't see much of his father as a child. But, he has a lot of friends which are adorable. He hangs with them all day. We think their names were <strong>Guffie, Fluffy, Axy, Froggie, Foggie, Salsie. </strong> If we had to explain them:<br/><br/><strong>Guffie</strong>: The purple ghost.<br/><strong>Fluffy</strong>: Cutest cat alive.<br/><strong>Axy</strong>: The pink axolotl. <br/><strong>Froggie</strong>: Frog laughing meme.<br/><strong>Salsie</strong>: The shy tomato.<br/><strong>Foggie</strong>: Tired from climate change.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we are super excited to see you. Don't miss this adventure! We'll be waiting for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T03:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0846e890ab2f2ed5d0873a3b1f7787.jpg", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/muzdawakzl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benelux"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Benelux"], "esrb_rating": null}
