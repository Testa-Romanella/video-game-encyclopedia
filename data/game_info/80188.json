You are controlling your Shinobi and directing him so that collision with the tricky obstacles is avoided. The term Shinobi is closely related with the Japanese culture and it can be used a substitution word for what is generally known and referred to as a Ninja. Shinobi is the primary focus of this game and all the actions he was designed to perform such as jumping,running and collecting essential items are only one tap away!   <br/><br/>The preference for minimalism, which is typical for the Japanese culture is reflected also in the fact that only two colors were used for the interface design - black and white- giving a touch of mystery to the game. The endless gameplay may appear simple to manage but it is quite a challenge. If you\u2019ve ever played the notorious Flappy Bird, you already have a sense of how addictive and hard to beat Ultimate Shinobi is.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>-Insanely simple and addictive<br/>-Endless gameplay <br/>-High scores with Game Center", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T03:40:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa6754817d527ca382f4946210c67dd.jpg", "website": "http://www.myarcadegames.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Furkan Sonmez"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Furkan Sonmez"], "esrb_rating": null}
