But hit the dice carefully, because it may reinforce your enemies ! Also, try to kill the zombies quickly, or they'll enrage and kill you really fast.</p>\r\nRecommendations\r\n<p>The game is about scoring and competition. It's especially fun to play with a few friends, so you can compare performances, trash talk each others, and complain about that f*cking RNG!! Take turns to crush high scores and zombies, have fun, and good luck!
