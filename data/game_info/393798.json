Construct 2 evidently does not like newer, infinitely better browsers, and I can't be bothered to find out why. If played in these, you will not hear all the game's SFX.</p>\n<p>Greg &amp; Pussy Destroyer, (Or simply Greg &amp; PD for short) was a game that was never meant to exist. Created purely out of spite for the bosses of my teacher who misinformed me about the task at hand, the game exists purely as a troll towards those who would expect me to redo an entire assignment at the last minute because the cans and cannots of said assignment were redecided without my knowledge. Having to choose between starting my vehicular combat project anew, or adapting it into a platformer, essentially making it into reverse Banjo Kazooie Nuts &amp; Bolts, I ultimately chose to give them exactly what they wanted.<br/></p>\n<p>Greg &amp; PD is a game about a bear named Greg, with a pigeon named Pussy Destroyer duct taped to his back. The two must brave the perilous land of meme hell, and defeat the mighty Duane gif and his army of poorly drawn nut monsters. Using his uncanny ability to summon cars out of thin air and use them as projectiles, Greg &amp; PD are a mighty force to behold in this epic of our time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c15bd1e2131846e5a95b3567182f04c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vahkiti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
