Some suspects have been found, and it is your job to find out where the bomb is at all costs. In this 2D puzzle adventure you will be faced with many difficult decisions. You will be armed with an arsenal of personal information for interrogation, and a toolbox of instruments to \"pursuade\" the suspects to give you the information that you need. How you derive the information necessary is up to you. You determine what is right and what is wrong, the only question is- will you be left with dirty hands?</p><p>WARNING : This game is currently in development and all features have yet to be implemented.
