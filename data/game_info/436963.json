The concept was a bit different: let every creator do bits and pieces of gameplay as he or she intends, with no art direction, no established gameplay systems, no theme, no pre-conceived tone, and see how far we could go.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We called this development and design process\u00a0<em>\u201cClock\u201d:</em>\u00a0every creator makes a\u00a0\u201cgear\u201d (small\u00a0system) which fits in the overall system,\u00a0with little to no preceding dependencies from other \"gears\".\u00a0\u00a0Every two or three hours we would update the main build, which could be played from the get go at the venue.</p>\n<p>We were aiming at creating a deliberately unfocused conceptual corps exquis, not a curated \u201ccinematic\u201d linear experience \u2013 we wanted our creative process to be artistically and conceptually as pure as possible \u2013 we wanted the challenge of implementing a needlessly sophisticated and convoluted creative chimera \u2013 but most of all, our most ambitious aim was attempting the most horizontal collective process we could think of, in a medium that traditionally requires vertical hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>As we started developing the project, the result started gaining a stronger and stronger comedic tone. Absurdism, fourth-wall breaking and non-sequiturs because recurrent. As visitors played, they started referring to it as a <em>\u201cWarioWare\u201d</em> game (because of its mini-game structure) of \u201ctrolling\u201d \u2013 most of the content is meant to play with tropes and players\u2019 expectations.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThis time, we titled the end oeuvre \u201cThe Rhythm of The Night\u201d.\r\n<p>One of the songs that was in the main build was Corona\u2019s <em>\u201cRhythm of the Night\u201d</em> \u2013 which we included in reference to James Franco\u2019s <em>\u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d</em>, a movie which explores the idea of auteurship through a metamodernist and comedic lens and features the same song \u2013 and which is why we gave our creation the same name.</p>\n\n<p>Most of what we did was also (probably? maybe?) highly illegal as well \u2013 we might release a \u201csafe\u201d final version with some content cut out \u2013 but the actual build, due to a sense of humor heightened by sleep deprivation and substance abuse, displayed private data and unlicensed content for comedic purposes.</p>\r\nCreated by<br/>Catarina Lopes I\u00a0David Filipe I\u00a0Filipe Pedras I\u00a0Isaque Sanches I\u00a0Jo\u00e3o Antunes I\u00a0Mafalda Claro I\u00a0Rui Humberto I\u00a0Tiago Marques", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T05:02:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06af0854758b9449f81ca4f4d40f62f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Isaque Sanches", "Tiago Marques", "anacat", "David Filipe", "Mafalda Claro", "RuiHumberto", "Jo\u00e3o Eiras Antunes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
