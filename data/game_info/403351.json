{"id": 403351, "slug": "lootbox-rpg-itch", "name": "Lootbox RPG (itch)", "name_original": "Lootbox RPG (itch)", "description": "<p>Lootbox is a dungeon crawler for iOS and Android. You explore many dungeons with different dangers and rewards, get access to magic spells and new skills and develop your character throughout the story.</p>\n<p>At first sight some of you may say \u201coh no, another rogue clone\u201d. But it is not. I hate rogue, because when you do something stupid, you die. And the game is over. Very frustrating. And not defining the dungeon crawler genre.</p>\n<p>Lootbox does things different. First, You cannot die \u2013 that means, you can die, but this won\u2019t be the end of the game. You simply return to safety with some losses but you can try again and if you are smart you can use this method to get a quick way out of the dungeon. Furthermore, you will not lose any experience points.</p>\n<p>Second, there are no real time decisions. Take your time, the game is round-based. You can play it during a short break, while riding a bus or train or whenever you have some minutes to relax. It will entertain you not only with a cool user interface but with a cool story and a good portion of humour.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Random dungeon generation, Maze-like and Cave-like</li>\n<li>Static levels with NPC and Quests</li>\n<li>Build your character up to level 40</li>\n<li>Unlock new skills while levelling</li>\n<li>Find magic runeboards and runes to cast spells</li>\n<li>Get you own minion that can carry things for you or even fight for you!</li>\n<li>Turn-based - you can play it anytime, anywhere - even if you're in a hurry</li>\n<li>Available in english and german language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why is it satisfying? Imagine the following situations...</p>\n<p>\"Oh no, an incoming call!\"</p>\n<p>no real time decisions, you can safely interrupt the game at any point.</p>\n<p>\"So late already?\"</p>\n<p>no need to exit the game, a real world clock can be switched on optionally.</p>\n<p>\"What? I AM DEAD?\"</p>\n<p>No permadeath, this is no rogue-clone. You can load/save at any time, or return to safety without losing all your money or equipped items.</p>\n<p>\"Damn! I died and I forgot to save!\"</p>\n<p>The game is autosaved every level, don't panic.</p>\n<p>\"If I only could teach those damn rats what I've learned...\"</p>\n<p>You can come back to your old friends and show them your uber gear.</p>\n<p>\"Nice game, but my smartphone is over 5 years old...\"</p>\n<p>The game runs well on older devices, happy playing!</p>\n<p>\"Where can I buy money?\"</p>\n<p>Nowhere. This game is OFFLINE and there is NO Pay-To-Win mechanism. Sorry.</p>\n<p>\"Where is the chatroom?\"</p>\n<p>There are enough messengers already in the world, right?</p>\n<p>\"Where do I have to register?\"</p>\n<p>Register what? This game is OFFLINE. I don't need your data, thanks anyway.</p>\n<p>\"Where is the premium version?\"</p>\n<p>There isn't. Buy once, play endless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb3f9c04eeab70f49c1ad87f1b216737.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mario Gaida"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
