You control the last remaining sandship: a gigantic, artificially intelligent mega-factory, which roams across the endless deserts of a far-away planet. Noranti One was a highly advanced civilization. After an accident forced your sandship into hibernation, it awoke in a world of ruins. Join us on a journey to rediscover forgotten technologies, forge a better tomorrow through crafting and trade, and fight a vicious cult hellbent on your destruction. Unlock the secrets of this cryptic land onboard your incredible sandship.<br />\nDesign futuristic factories from the ground up in this free to play adventure. Place devices like synthesizers, chemical mixers, and ice guns in your sandship factory. The more devices you have, the greater your automated productivity. Connect those devices with conveyor belts to craft a wide variety of materials, from copper wires and combustion engines to ancient technology utilizing the mythic power of the overwell. Upgrade your sandship and add bigger factories to get the space you\u2019ll need to produce more complex items. Trade the incredible stuff you make to earn credits, XP and get old crates filled with scientific research from the distant past. This ancient knowledge gives your sandship new abilities, becoming stronger, smarter, and more powerful than she\u2019s been in a long, long time.<br />\nYour engineering mentor is Harvey, a tenacious one-eyed cyborg who needs your help to reconnect with his past. Harvey will show you the ropes of sandship engineering as you build and maintain more complex factories on a desert journey. Are you ready to voyage through a mysterious alien desert with many obstacles in your path? The planet is inhabited by an unusual assortment of robots and aliens. Some are friendly and astounded by your sandship. Others are hostile and want to see your sandship destroyed, but you\u2019re not sure why. Complete quests to meet new characters, uncover ancient civilizations, hear campfire stories and learn how this once industrious world crumbled in the distant past.<br />\nThere\u2019s so much to discover on-board a sandship. Solve factory floor puzzles, then create your own to share with other players. Get creative in the sandbox to try out new setups without using any resources. Build an enigmatic underwell to mine precious resources, but be prepared to defend against hordes of extraterrestrial enemies to collect them. New features and places to explore are added continuously. The universe of Sandship is constantly expanding.<br />\nFEATURES<br />\nEngineered for Fun:<br />\nFree to Play<br />\nDesign a futuristic assembly line for automated crafting<br />\nProduce everything from simple items to otherworldly technology<br />\nPlace more devices to create increasingly complex materials<br />\nTrade what you make for credits, XP, and crates containing ancient knowledge<br />\nUpgrade your sandship\u2019s size to mythic proportions<br />\nMaximize your credits to buy buildings, devices, and decorations<br />\nDevelop holographic blueprints to get creative with your setups<br />\nSolve factory floor puzzles and share your own<br />\nExplore the World:<br />\nHelp Harvey, your cyborg engineering mentor, reconnect with his past<br />\nComplete quests to earn rewards and assist the colorful inhabitants of Noranti One<br />\nAdventure through a strange planet inhabited by aliens and robots<br />\nUncover lost civilizations and learn their secret histories<br />\nDefend your sandship against hordes of extraterrestrial enemies</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-19T06:30:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32d19e07180b0f5a8a0f8f9a93dad6c9.jpg", "website": "http://sandship.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Rockbite Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Rockbite"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
