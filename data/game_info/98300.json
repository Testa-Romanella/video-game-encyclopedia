The theme was \"Preparation: Set it up and let it go\", so I made this game.\u00a0It's an RPG game, except all you do is the shopping, then you sit back and watch how well your preparations\u00a0worked for your automatically controlled character (for those not in the know, NPC means 'Non Player Character'\u00a0in role-playing parlance). There's still quite a bit of strategy to it, and it's pretty fun. Try to get a high\u00a0score! By the way, before playing, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! This isn't the\u00a0version created in 48 hours. This version adds a ton of vast improvements, though the original may have been better\u00a0balanced. It was certainly easier!</p>\n<p>*\u00a0Purchase fabulous items like the Fuschia Housecoat and Amulet of Omelet</p>\n<p>* Thrill as you watch your adventurer adventure!</p>\n<p>* Astounding ability to speed up the watching.</p>\n<p>* Level up and change into one of 9 different classes, including Used Car Salesman and Chef.</p>\n<p>* A high score table, so compete away!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9dae8fb18a67f71f6a5517933adcc4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hamumu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
