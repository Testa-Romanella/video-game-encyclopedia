In addition to the \n      challenging main game, you\u2019ll find three different minigames to further \n      improve your kappa-related skills.\n    </p><p>\n      You\u2019ll start your journey in Kappa Cove, a good place to go exploring, \n      practice getting around, and munch on a few fish. The intuitive controls \n      are all handled with the stylus (draw a trail and the kappa will follow \n      it), but the helpful Chumfish is more than willing to teach you the \n      basics. Once you begin your path down the Kappa Trail, you\u2019ll encounter \n      coins to collect, boulders to shatter, various mini kappas that can help \n      in specific ways, and more. Just make sure that you avoid the Devil \n      Hand, OK? And if you need a break, you can collect paintings or \n      cassettes from the Chumfish Shack, count plates at a sushi restaurant, \n      or test your mettle in the treacherous Trial of Tiles.\n    </p><p>\n      With its cute graphics and charming story, your time with the kappa will \n      certainly be memorable. Who knows what you\u2019ll find as you make your way \n      through A Kappa\u2019s Trail?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe743e7a5e66aa1be1a92cf83d9739b1.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/akappastrail/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
