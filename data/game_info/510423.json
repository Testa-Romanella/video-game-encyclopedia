Here is the game I've been working on for the past few months. This is not a finished product so not all the features (a timer, win/lose game notification, etc.) are not present and there are a few bugs (ie: the ball hitting you with the same exact force you hit it with). I plan to add in these features and fix these bugs in future updates to this game\u00a0(well maybe not the ball bug since it's kind of fun).</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game!</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see some in-progress videos of this game, check out my youtube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXXxQJo31tm-CDwcw1vu0AA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:55:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2a0dbf54bae7dcdf7fe251efc73c60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chollis2021"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
