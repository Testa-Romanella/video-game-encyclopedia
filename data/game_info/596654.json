Unfortunately your are just an Assistant Scientist, so your budget for tools to protect the world is limited. Well, at least you're not off doing fetch-quests or collecting the 10 crucially important boar hides!</p>\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to capture the <strong>Weirdo</strong> emerging from the portal. To do this, you need to wear it out by making it visit every tile - only then can you catch the <strong>Weirdo</strong> in the container.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game is controlled via mouse/touch. You select what type of mirror you want to place on the hexagonal grid, you select which tile you want to place it on and you select the rotation of the mirror - easy peasy lemon squeezy!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Art and Code by Clockwork Pepper<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Orbiting A Distant Planet\u00a0by\u00a0Quantum Jazz is licensed under a\u00a0Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.</p>\n<p>Made for Gamedev.js Jam 2021\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c697ff2d6fe3e3fe29826c8341b4e473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clockwork Pepper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
