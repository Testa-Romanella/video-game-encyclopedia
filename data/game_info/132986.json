These intertwined lives can also be interpreted as a split in their shared timeline. This means that an intertwined timeline is split apart when a relationship is broken.</p><p>The case you are about to solve is one of those cases. You will be stationed in the same house, but can switch between different timelines. One where the man left the woman and one where the woman left the man.</p><p>Your task is to make them remember the good times together, by interpreting their thoughts and giving them the right item you collect from the opposite dimension's room.</p><p>Make their lives happy again by reuniting their timelines!</p><p><strong>Help/Controls:</strong><br/></p><p>You need to talk to the people and interpret their compaints to find the corresponding item in the opposite timeline.
