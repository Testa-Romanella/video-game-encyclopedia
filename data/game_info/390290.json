Just LEFT CLICK on an existing block to remove. LEFT CLICK on a suitable area to add the part.</p>\n<p>- You need to remove component (Guns/Propellers) before you want remove a block.</p>\n<p>- You can only have two guns.</p>\n<p>- You can remove everything single block.</p>\n<p>- The more blocks the slower you get.</p>\n<p>A 2D shoot em up style game.\u00a0Use WASD or the arrow keys to move and the left and right mouse buttons to shoot.</p>\n<p>The more damaged your components become, the less effective they get, so avoid damage(duh!)</p>\n<p>You can customise your ship to fit your play style with a variety of weapons and propellers, which counter some enemies, but will make you struggle against others. There are a lot of options, which one was your favourite? On a side note, don't put one gun behind another one, because the front one will get damaged and you might not want that to happen. Really optimise your ship and think, blocks will block damage to your weapons and propellers.</p>\n<p>The game is beatable just build smartly and play better.</p>\n<p>Some of the music effects were gotten from\u00a0http://soundbible.com/\u00a0.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/056/056922b5c3c774a05f7e99fdfb128a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vinzmyko", "Ethan Crooks", "Konstantin Mishtalov"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
