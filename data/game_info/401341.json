You need 8500 points by the end of the 3rd boss in order to progress. Otherwise its game over and you have to start again in order to play the last 4 levels.\u00a0 Use (A) to move left, (D) to move right, space bar to shoot. You can take two hits before you die, then the level restarts.<br/></p>\r\nThe best way to play this game is by downloading it. Each level has a unique retro/chip-tune/tracker song. They will sound fine on Windows, but if you play in the browser many of the songs will have static noises because of the audio compression. I added a song mute feature for this reason. (Some of the static is pretty bad.) If you want to play online, try to lower the volume at least.\r\n<p>If you download it on Windows, it runs smoother, and it's also a little more difficult. Because sometimes in the online version the lag makes it easier for you to dodge attacks.</p>\r\n|&gt;-&gt;Here's the link to the webpage version&lt;-&lt;|\r\nI hope it isn't too hard, but everything is able to be beaten, I swear on my grade!\r\n<p><em>- Ethem Ficici</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c9ac193bdc4e7d021ff5fa8e2e8ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethem Ficici"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
