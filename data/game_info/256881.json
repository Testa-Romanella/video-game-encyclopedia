Hope you enjoy it nonetheless.</strong></p><p>In For Pete's Sake, you play as a developer participating in a 150 second game jam. The high intensity means that Pete must keep well fed and clean, or he will DIE. Pete's development cycle involves shooting bugs, glitches, and using combo-brackets.</p><p>I have done a few game jams now, so I thought I would go for something a bit more ambitious, however it turned out I didn't have enough time to finish all the art, or even start on music / sounds (damned school!), so I definitely want to focus on that next time round (LD43 looking at you). I think that this is the most enjoyable game I have made for a game jam, and I have really enjoyed the week!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc3/cc324379caab84f0813de8008a69389c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Azoghal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
