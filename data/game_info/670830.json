If you use a flash cart, it needs to support ROM bank switching and battery saves using MBC5.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is written in C using the GBDK-2020 development kit, and the gbt-player music driver.\u00a0 All assets were made by me during the jam period. I used GBTD and\u00a0GBMB to make the tilesets and maps,\u00a0OpenMPT to compose the music, and BGB for debugging.</p>\n<p>This is a \"black cart\" game that runs in full colour on GBC, or in monochrome on DMG. In practical terms, this means working within the more restrictive CPU and memory limits of the DMG,\u00a0 ensuring that all graphics work in both monochrome and colour, and forgoing some GBC-only features like tile mirroring.<br/><br/>The full source code is available for download. To build the ROM from source, you'll need to install GBDK-2020, and adjust the paths in the Makefile to suit your environment.</p>\n<p><strong>License:</strong></p>\n<p><corrib75> is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\u00a0 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\u00a0 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</corrib75></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:50:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1eaf5c10917b0c4b2115ad83987ee63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gearfo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
