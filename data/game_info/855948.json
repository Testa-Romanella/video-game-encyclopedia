A game where you are both the paintbrush and the painter! Every time you touch a block you absorb it's color. Can you use your multi-colored ability to get the block colors back in the correct order before the evil Dr. Pigment cranks up the temperature?\u00a0Find out now!</p>\n<p>A game made for the 3rd VimJam! My first game jam, excited to share it with the community that inspired me to game and was a great source of support\u00a0during lockdown.</p>\n<p>The game jam challenge had both a focus and a theme. The focus was Multi-Use. The approach I took to this was that you, the player (Hue) are both mechanic for\u00a0color and the mechanic for moving that color. Since each block can either be red or blue, they also have multiple uses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the theme \"Turn Up the Heat\"\u00a0I went very literal, the evil Dr. Pigment is going to turn up the temperature in the rooms when there is only 20 seconds left. Can you complete the sequence before it gets too hot?\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The jump and menu click sound effects were from a royalty free sound pack I\u00a0downloaded years ago.
