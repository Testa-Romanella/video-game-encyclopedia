Needless to say it's a <strong>feature</strong>.<br/>\n<strong>For second</strong>, it's all carefully hand-pixelated. I personally took care of each pixel on screen.<br/>\n<strong>Third</strong>, it's not your average pixelated adventure game. Its story, sounds and music are designed and engineered to make the game stand on its own.<br/>\n<strong>Fourth</strong>, it actually enhance your mind. Its meaning maybe is one of the deepest you'll ever find in a game. And keeping playing it will make you understand what does it mean.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNow some hint on the <strong>plot</strong>.
