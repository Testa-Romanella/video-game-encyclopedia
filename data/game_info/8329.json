Turn up the volume and enjoy playing while the lights pulse to the game&amp;#39;s music.<br/><br/>LightGlide is an extremely simple but challenging puzzle game to learn and play. Most find the first few levels easy, but be warned: it gets much harder!<br/><br/>Place your finger on the flashing light and glide it over nearby lights until you reach the finish. You must clear all lights before you reach the finish to move on to the next level. Complete all the levels of a stage to unlock a new stage that has new types of lights to make the game more challenging.<br/><br/>Each level is randomly created as you unlock it so no two people will ever play the exact same game! Any time you go back to replay a level you&amp;#39;ve beaten you&amp;#39;ll be faced with a brand new randomly created level.<br/><br/>If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send an email. App publishers can&amp;#39;t reply to their app reviews.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c9e6469c2565cd3632659270353d76.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jonathan Kent"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Kent"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
