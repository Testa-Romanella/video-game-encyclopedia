When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one and the original number doubles. Tile numbers increase from 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 and so on until 2048 and beyond. New tiles appear on the board after each swipe and start off as the value 2 or 4. The ultimate goal is to combine enough tiles to get to the 2048 tile and win!
