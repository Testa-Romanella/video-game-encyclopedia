I just wanted it to be encapsulated inside this little piece of mechanics.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to collect 22 notes. To collect them, you need to click on the \"play\" button and go to the sandbox level.</p>\n\n<p>At the level, simply remove the sand and lower the girl's figurine below, to the stones (carefully, if you touch the upper or lower frame, the level will end).</p>\n<p>A new note is obtained only if the girl's figurine has reached the stones below.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the bag are a phone, a notebook and water.</p>\n<p>In a notebook, you can pump traction (manually or auto), glow, visibility of coins and level value.</p>\n\n<p>Upgrades are bought with coins collected in the level.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>You can also download the source code of the game for Construct 2 and pictures.</p>\n\n<p>I can be contacted here:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://t.me/game_sunlight\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://vk.com/gamesunlight</p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<p>Other projects (click on image)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T11:26:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b10f44cf9f3dd53065b1953bac1c6bfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
