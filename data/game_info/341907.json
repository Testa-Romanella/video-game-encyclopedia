Someone used this graphics pack already!\u00a0\u00a0:(</p>\n<p>I had not noticed until I was half way done with the game. Regardless it is not the graphic art (even though it is beautiful)\u00a0that is meant to be the focus of this\u00a0upload; it's the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the feel of it and that you also enjoy the game design itself. It is my first upload and my first finished\u00a0game project. I polished it the best I could. and to the best of my abilities. I\u00a0can only get better with time!\u00a0I will also be uploading it to my first game jam here on itch.io.</p>\n<p>This is the type of games that I\u00a0love to play and would love to make. No need for all that \"extra\" tedious junk from nowadays. There are TOO many\u00a0games that are a jack\u00a0of all trades but master of none.\u00a0With me it's all about the FUN and SOLID mechanics!</p>\n<p>\u00a0I am a huge platformer fan since my kid days playing Super Mario World on the SNES. Which is my inspiration along with the inspiration and guidance of Jerementor. Thank you Jerementor.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this please donate and support me so that I\u00a0can continue to make these kind of games (in a larger scale)!\u00a0\u00a0I would love to develop video games for a living and eventually with some support I'd love to develop something real nice for you guys!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing! Thank you for reading!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10c/10ca3e53526143e414de7a5f42694fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DishonoredBrotherhood"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
