However, the land appears to be nothing more than a tangle of wild country awaiting a strong-willed individual to turn it into a thriving village manor. Build your manor house and attract peasants to work for you in exchange for your protection. Eventually your village grows to a city and then a kingdom.  Begin your great dynasty, destined to rule the known world.</p><p>The game is in early alpha with only survival game-play implemented.</p><p>More information on the game's website: http://www.arboreantears.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/5253c8cceb50c2284fced23456600c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["thes33"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
