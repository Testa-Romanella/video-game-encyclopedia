This is just a short demo/proof of concept and not of a demo of an actual commercial game. I made this game as part of school coursework, I have no intention of making this a full game, sorry :/ Yeah I know, its not a particularly great game, but if you like it then thanks anyways! I guess I'd describe this as action adventure with some bullet hell elements, atleast thats the general concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/2892373f5c7fc45d45bd38090e4bff59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crazy4videogames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
