As your adventure expands there are many ways to progress in the game such as questing and playing minigames.  Rewards come in the form of sacred gems, coins and the elusive XP.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the early days, as XP grows you are faced with choices that need to be made.  Will you use XP to add an NPC family member to assist you, contribute to the local community food supply or take the next step in your evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFood is collected locally in your haven or risk bigger hauls by collecting food in the multiplayer meadows. However, you'll need to outsmart other players and avoid larger animals as YOU ARE THEIR FOOD!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen xp is high enough choose from additional rewards, remain as the current animal or unlock and play as others higher in the food chain traversing through the food chain.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe warned, evolution can take a dark turn at this point as you realise your food chain is now the lower level characters.  To survive and support your families position in the community you need to hunt others from different communities in the shared food gathering meadows.   Not your cup of tea? no problem, stay in the animal group you are happy with and spend your XP on building a community and protecting it against predators.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are currently a collective of different animal groups, small furbies such as rabbits, racoons and red pandas.  Mid sized boars, foxes, wolves etc and larger sized tigers, lions, stags, courgers and bears.  Each bringing a unique set of fighting skills, speed attributes and variety to the game.  There may also be an aerial selection on hand to assist you if you come across a predator but let's keep that a secret for now.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeath could be disastrous to game progression, you are presented with scenarios to continue, lose an NPC family member, xp for the current level, rewards or impact the community food supply.  How you react affects your community position and game progress, attacks are engaging and trigger a fight or flight response. Work with other players to attack and defend each other in order to survive.  Call in air support from ravens, land support from bears. It\u2019s going to be an exciting ride.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHigh action sequences are currently experienced in third person with plans for first person and even immersive Oculus VR.  Animals are true to scale adding to the ambiance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat's your animal instinct telling you?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T02:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85f/85f1539ea23e9a781ad715b660b1f553.jpg", "website": "https://www.anilife.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Diego Herrera"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Diego Herrera"], "esrb_rating": null}
