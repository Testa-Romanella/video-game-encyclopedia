This chubby cat is a modern-day Robin Hood, with pie-in-the-sky dreams of raiding a trove of gold, and redistributing the wealth to the feline working class. Rumors have been floating around about a billionaire's secret hoard, stashed up in the cloudtops. Those coins could feed the hungry for years, and if we're not kidding ourselves, nobody's gonna notice that they're gone. So Meowlionaire straps on a jetpack and launches into the clouds with a dream in her heart and a money sack in her paw.
