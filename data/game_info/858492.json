I made this product as a result of looking at other games and going can I possible make a worse one. Answer is no. Some of these game I see people make that they spend time on are way worse.\u00a0But I made a fun but pretty bad one. It has an awful camera. Horribly explained. Assets just floating around. Things making no sense. All free assets. Pretty much what you would expect. I wanted to make a silly fun game that people can have a good time with. That so bad it is good type of game but the difference is I did it on purpose and not just how it turned out. <br/><br/><strong>I do not plan to bug fix or anything since I want some of those weird bug found. I will change something if it makes the game unplayable. So let me know if something is found that breaks the game. But if you are just walking and fall through the map. That stuff is funny and what I want to happen.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>REMEMBER TO HAVE FUN!! THAT IS THE POINT IN THIS PRODUCT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT PLEASE DON'T PLAY IT. GO PLAY SOMETHING YOU ENJOY.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T11:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff94386869a3dd306efdfe20995c7c60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperGustadolph"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
