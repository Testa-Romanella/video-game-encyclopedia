Minigolf!?<br/><br/>Deckbuilding meets minigolf in Golfie \u2013 the only game in which you can power-up and modify realtime golf shots by collecting and crafting a deck of cards.<br/><br/>Each run requires strategy, planning, and skill. Build unique decks which can unlock incredible new ways to play, giving you the power to pull off some spectacular shots.<br/><br/>Try to beat 18 holes from an unlimited supply of procedurally-generated levels in the single-player roguelike campaign. Shape the deck your way by collecting cards, and gain bonuses and abilities through special modifiers \u2013 all of which can combine to create truly unique shots. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Card powers can vary from increasing the distance or elevation of a standard shot, through to out-of-this-world abilities and power-ups which can be combined to dazzling effect. But be careful: finish over par and you\u2019ll lose some energy \u2013 and once it\u2019s totally depleted, the run is over. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Daily runs, endless modes and seeded runs  mean you\u2019ll never run out of holes to play. Gain experience during each run to unlock an ever-increasing pool of cards and customisation options, then return to the course with even more ways to play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Golfie is currently in Early Access, with additional single-player and multiplayer content planned.
