Having a huge passion for the navy my first ever project was a pong remake with a naval theme thrown on it, and for my final project of the course,\u00a0I wanted to create a 3D game environment that used the naval theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Brief synopsis of the story:</strong><br/>The world is on the brink of war,\u00a0 and all aspects of the military are preparing for orders to mobilize around the world. Set within a naval base packed with several naval vessels, a strikeforce of five warships\u00a0is being sent out into the ocean to patrol its territorial waters.<br/><br/><strong>Plot twist:</strong><br/>Radar has detected an enemy fleet heading towards the naval base with orders potentially to destroy the entire base,\u00a0 the strikeforce's new task is to find and locate the enemy fleet before it gets to the naval base and completes its objective.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: (Flying Camera to tour)<br/>W - Forward<br/>A - Left<br/>S - Backwards<br/>D - Right<br/>Mouse - Viewing</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf662407e119f2afc8286e9fe0e38a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Only In Seattle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
