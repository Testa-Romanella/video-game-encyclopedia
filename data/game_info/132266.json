You're the life of the party, since you're the owner and all... If someone isn't trying to knock glasses with you, they're trying to get a refill! Best not mix them up, though....<br/></p>\n<p>=================================</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>1. Press Button 1 to fill a customer's empty glass. (A for P1, K for P2)<br/>2. Press Button 2 to toast with a customer. (S for P1, L for P2)<br/></p>\n<p>=================================<br/></p>\n<p>I saw this game jam last week, but it didn't really interest me at the time. The thought of getting my game played overseas and featured in a bar was certainly quite cool (even though I'm allergic to beer myself), but I couldn't think up of a good idea.<br/></p>\n<p>Until 8 hours before the deadline.</p>\n<p>So yeah, managed to churn this out in 8-ish hours. Thankfully having little to no sound was recommended! I'll definitely do a bit of polishing, if that's allowed, but otherwise, the game is feature-complete!<br/><br/>UPDATE: New version just looks a bit prettier in some places, and the flow's a bit smoother. Nothing big.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Now in fullscreen. Esc brings you back to the main menu, Esc in the main menu quits the game.</p>\n<p>=================================<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5efdb30d146a1c4a64972d587e06ce22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JunoStriker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
