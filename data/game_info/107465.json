Take control of The Assassin, The Knight, or the Adventurer and try and grab as much loot as you can. But beware, as you are not alone in the dungeon. The Phantom Knight and his minions are not too keen to give up their long hoarded treasure. Be prepared for battle, and bring a big backpack.</p><em><strong>Patching</strong></em><p>While DunGen is completely playable in it's current state, the game is still in development, and new content will be released regularly.
