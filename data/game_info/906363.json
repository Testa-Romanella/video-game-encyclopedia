Due to that, I was not able to achieve everything I wanted to do (e.g. there are no sound effects :(), and it also took me longer than the expected 3h.\u00a0<br/>But it was a great learning experience, and I hope it is fun to play as well.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)<br/><br/>PS: Unfortunately I got some issues with the resolution for the WebGL here in itch.io (again, first published project), so it looks not perfect. Use full screen for better experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Graphics:\u00a0https://craftpix.net/product/top-down-2d-game-kit/</li><li>Music:\u00a0https://motionarray.com/royalty-free-music/jump-on-me-1248948/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b4a154ad83b1a93a6dbb04c4c49c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spinner-web"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
