{"id": 798501, "slug": "between-worlds-broockle", "name": "Between Worlds (Broockle)", "name_original": "Between Worlds (Broockle)", "description": "<p>\u00a0We find ourselves on a chunk of rock floating in this world between worlds. \r\nIt\u2019s a floating island, in a space without anything in it. Endless space in all directions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0But there are portals to other worlds. In fact when portals are made in different worlds they often end up in this world as this world between worlds is close to all worlds simultaneously. \r\nThe Inbetween is a Nexus point for a few worlds, one was found by a culture of Vikings who followed their ever guiding serpent deity. One is controlled by a race of floating eyeballs which seem to levitate and control telekinetic powers but which refuse to talk to beings of lesser origin. Another portal on the rock leads to a civilization of robots which seek new sources to generate electricity.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0There\u2019s a large church-like structure on the rock however that none of the three cultures seem to know the origin of. Some think that opening it could unveil their long forgotten history, or perhaps reveal a far more advanced civilization.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Each of the races have an item that we can collect, we need all of them to open the temple door. The shield from the Vikings, the Crescent moon from the eyes which is the source of their telekinetic powers, and the lightning piece which is the source of power the robots use in this realm.\u00a0\r\nThe three cultures engage in trade and cultural exchange, so these are peaceful times upon the rock. \r\nThe player character is a traveler between worlds, by circumstance we have landed in this world between worlds but we must continue our journey onto the next world by any means necessary. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T10:50:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b523c54b95a713d42d31aa191da9ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broockle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
