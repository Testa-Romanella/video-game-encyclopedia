As soon as you don the head gear, you are transported to authentic environments with real shotgun physics. You aim your shotgun, pull the trigger, and blast the clay! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nClazer uses technology, patented by LeadTech, that teaches you the proper way to lead a target so you can accurately hit it. Real physics are integrated that actually simulate the ballistics of various types of shot. Professional sport shooters have already provided enthusiastic feedback. Clazer is so accurate that it will improve your ability to shoot real targets using an actual shotgun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave fun in three different environments : Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand. You have access to a practice mode that helps to better visualize missed shot trajectory. Competition modes for Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand integrate professional rules and guidelines. Compete on the global leaderboard or locally. A great party game! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nClazer runs on Windows with support for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Oculus Touch.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b2619c491052cd18143b23a84df7599e.jpg", "website": "http://clazer.club", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SynapticSwitch"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["SynapticSwitch", "LeadTech"], "esrb_rating": null}
