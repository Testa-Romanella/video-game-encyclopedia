Worst of all, a foreign military has been informed our work. Naturally, the spy responsible for that has been found and executed but the fact remains that we are now under siege.<br/><br/>We must use our new weapons to defend our work and protect our research. We will be able to ransack enemies for cash to fund further development once we have... ahem.... incapacitated each enemy.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve heard that the enemy will regularly take time to regroup, but that means that they will be stronger each time they attack as they learn how to navigate paths and dodge attacks.
