I added Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune. I decided to add these planets because: Venus is my favorite planet, Jupiter is fun looking, and my dog's name is Neptune. Although Neptune is not in frame at all times, this was a purposeful choice, as when I edited the FOV and camera distance, I didn't like how it looked. The project said to adjust the cameras so it would be \"how [I] want it to look\", and overall I really love how it looks even if Neptune isn't always in frame. This project was for sure a lot of fun, and adding all the sounds and textures to the planets really made me feel like an actual game designer. I'm am extraordinarily excited for the projects to come.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Alex Fortsch</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added Features to Base<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Venus</li><li>Jupiter</li><li>Neptune</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Alex Fortsch<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f441f42d809ce2bd7e1e092a02cbf5bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["alexfortsch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
