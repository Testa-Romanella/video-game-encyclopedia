No More Chocolate. The students were in an uproar but what could they do? As the ban dragged on, people started studying and staying awake in class. People even started to forget how good chocolate tastes.<br/><br/>Please press F to pay respects.<br/><br/>Separetely, Chocolateman, Apprentice of Sandman, wasn't allowed to use sand yet but he wasn't dissappointed. Since he was young, he's always loved chocolate but his parents never let him have it, As he grew older, he wanted it more and more until he became the Chocolateman he is today. After hearing about the chocolate ban at a school, he laughed maniacally because he knew exactly what the school needed and he was coming. Soon no one in the school will be able to live without his chocolate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77c06f2a5b1b752f195024464496fbd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bobjrsenior", "vle", "FenceFoil", "Dimanor3"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
