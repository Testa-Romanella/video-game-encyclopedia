{"id": 387422, "slug": "concentration-grid", "name": "Concentration Grid", "name_original": "Concentration Grid", "description": "The concept of the mental focus grid has been in existence for many years - as a tool/exercise used by coaches and sports performance/psychology professionals to assess and improve performance of their athletes.  <br/><br/>The objective of the concentration grid exercise is to select in sequence each of the numbers (randomly arranged and presented) in the grid.  Performance is timed.  The challenge is to complete the grid as quickly as possible.  The exercise calls for focus and concentration. <br/><br/>The concentration grid exercise has been a long-time favorite of many baseball/softball coaches and players (typically using printed/paper sheets, a pen and a stopwatch).  <br/><br/>Coaches/sports performance staff and athletes now can do mental skills training work (and save paper) by using the Concentration Grid app on their mobile device.<br/><br/>The Concentration Grid app is intended to provide competitive challenge and a fun experience that is simple and straightforward ... like the printed paper grid exercise - but more convenient.  <br/><br/>Nothing fancy.  Nothing distracting.  Nothing flashy.  Only the grid.  Numbers.  Black. White. Red.  No on-screen timer or visible ticking clock.  <br/><br/>Focus.  Concentration.<br/><br/>With the Concentration Grid app the level and nature of the challenge can be varied by changing the size of the grid - by selecting the number of rows and columns for the grid.  <br/><br/>Grids can be generated in a variety of sizes - from 3 columns/rows to 14 columns/rows.  (A grid does not have to have the same number of rows and columns.)  More rows/columns, more numbers.  More numbers, more time.<br/><br/>Try a 3x3 grid ... a 3x14 grid ... a 7x7 grid ... a 7x10 grid ... a 10x10 grid .... a 10x14 grid ... a 14x14 grid.   You get the idea.<br/><br/>The standard is a 10x10 grid - which a focused grid master should be able to complete in under 4 minutes.<br/><br/>Other benchmarks ...<br/>A 3x3 grid can be completed in about 3 seconds.<br/>A 5x5 grid might be completed in under 15 seconds.<br/>A 7x7 grid can be completed by a master in well under a minute.<br/>A 9x9 grid might be completed in 3 minutes.<br/>A 14x14 grid will take well over 10 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>Test yourself:  Can you complete a 6x6 grid in under 30 seconds? <br/><br/>Smaller grids will call for dexterity and quick vision as well as focus/concentration.<br/><br/>Larger grids will challenge your ability to sustain focus/concentration ... your mental stamina is put to the test.<br/><br/>Challenge yourself with Concentration Grid.  Track and measure your improvement as you practice.  Then compare your best grid times against the best grid times of teammates and others ... who is the fastest?  Who is a master of the grid?  (Coaches and teachers can set up intrasquad competitions/tournaments to find out.)<br/><br/>Practice makes perfect.   Sustained attention and effort are rewarded with improved performance/times in the grid exercise.<br/><br/>The grid exercise can be practiced in quiet places/at home or during road trips or during school/practices ... or under loud/distracting (game day) conditions.  Parents/teachers might have their children/students use the exercise regularly to practice and improve concentration ability.  In a world filled with distractions, anyone can use Concentration Grid to practice focus skills. <br/><br/>The Concentration Grid app will provide your grid time (elapsed time to complete the grid exercise) as well as a GRID_ID data set that includes additional information about your performance.  The app will also maintain a history/file for you to monitor your performance/improvement.  <br/><br/>And Concentration Grid includes a SHARE feature which will allow you to share/post your grid times and screenshots on social media or to a leaderboard (community site).<br/><br/>The Concentration Grid app is perfect for coaches, athletes, students, teachers/educators, sports performance/psychology staff, parents, children, adults - young and old ....<br/><br/>Challenge yourself.  Make self-development a daily habit.  <br/><br/>Website - www.concentrationgrid.com<br/>Community - www.concentrationgrid.net", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/662499e1a9bfd2205f82eac67599c161_FOUi4gc.jpg", "website": "https://www.concentrationgrid.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["STALWART GROUP"], "genres": ["Sports", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["STALWART GROUP"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
