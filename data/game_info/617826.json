Control time and momentum to catapult the circles to their destination.<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry about the unintuitive controls. Unfortunately I didn't have time to make a tutorial or clear visual and audio feedback. I hope the description helps!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>LMB - Click a circle to unfreeze it with its stored momentum OR click and drag from one circle to another and release to link them together and unfreeze both.<br/></p>\n<p>RMB - Freeze time and break all connections. Momentum is stored in frozen state. <br/></p>\n<p>R - Reset the current Puzzle.</p>\n<p>Note: Connections can only be made while time is frozen.<br/></p>\n<p>This was my first Game Jam ever and I think it's pretty obvious from the state of the game. There are only 4 levels at this point. I wish I had more time to polish this one up, but I hope you get the general idea.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my little prototype! :)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>BGM - Myxtery by Pitx (c) copyright 2008 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/Pitx/13318 Ft: misterC\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:12:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e61f70d28221fc5f61bc9337dc85703f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TastiHam"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
