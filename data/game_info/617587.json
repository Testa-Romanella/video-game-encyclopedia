{"id": 617587, "slug": "dwarfed-together", "name": "Dwarfed Together", "name_original": "Dwarfed Together", "description": "<p>A little puzzle-platformer, that will have you \"joining together\" with other dwarves to explore an ancient vault in search of a treasure. Utilize your comrades' abilites and solve various puzzels. What riches lie at the end of this treacherous dungeon? <br/></p>\n<p>(Spoiler: the real treasure was the bugs we made along the way! If you are having troubles with Web player, try downloadable version. But there is a good chance the trouble will still be there :) )<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>[A],[D] to move</li><li>[Space] to jump</li><li>[LMB] to shoot</li><li>[E] to pick up dwarf companions</li><li>[Q] to drop companions</li></ul>\n<p>When you're standing near the other dwarf, you can pick them up on your shoulders and move together. Then drop them if needed. But beware, every dwarf is a master of his own trade, and, well, if you lose the one who can jump, you won't be able to jump anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I worked alone, and kinda lost a lot of time, so no sounds, almost no graphics, and a lot of stuff that I just didn't test and bugs that I didn't fix. But it's ok I guess.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8fa284e0358dbb50e27110a294968186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oneiromancer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
