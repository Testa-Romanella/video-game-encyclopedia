BINI is a pseudo-god system that rescues human faith from technological oppression. This cyberpuppet is controlled by the largest interest group in the information world, and the protagonist is the rebel of that group. After being purged and exiled, he will use his unique ability, Sudo, to manipulate the system, deconstruct language, take a tooth for a tooth, take an eye for an eye, and follow the true philosophy of spirit and information justice to correct and cleanse the world under the control of Bainism.</p>\n<p>In the game, players will play the role of K, infiltrate the shrine of information, challenge layers of levels, collect card resources to defeat the false god of language, and bring light and justice to the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T15:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209d18be7851dafac2f25930e186c127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandun Dreamers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
