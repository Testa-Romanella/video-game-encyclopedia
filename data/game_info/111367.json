Your dwarves will need to drink at the tavern, and rest in their dorm before going to work. You'll also need to hire craftsmen to make pickaxes for your miners. Then maybe, you'll be able to gather the precious stones, but beware of bankruptcy as you have to pay your employees' wages everyday.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3cbbfd0bb1479281f7766cf4623678e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Khopa"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
