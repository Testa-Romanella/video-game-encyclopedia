Taking the role of the titular \u201edaddy\u201d you\u2019ll have to stay on your toes, handpick the money earned by your girls and boys, take care of your respect on the streets, which will minimize the risk of violence and take care of giving bribes. All this is decorated with dirty, comic graphics, which makes our title one of a kind.   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T05:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3601a5616a30acb6ca3725b3e75609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rule Keeper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
