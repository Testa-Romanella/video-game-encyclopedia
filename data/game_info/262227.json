How many monsters will you take with you to the grave? 'Cause unfortunately, that's where this poor wizard guy's going.<br/></p>\n<p>Hi, my name is Ben, and this is the first game I'm releasing to the public! Poor Wizard Guy has been in the making for the past few months, and I'm finally happy with where it is. Please leave feedback! (Could the tutorial be improved, and how? Is something over-/under-powered? etc.) Any thoughts you have on the game would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Also! If you have an idea for new spell/enemy/anything, I might release a small update with user suggested content before I shelf this project :)</p>\n<p>NOTE BEFORE PLAYING: This game is supposed to be hard at first. My best advice to succeed is <em>keep moving</em>! You should hardly ever be standing still...plus, the wizard could use the exercise. I also suggest to set the game speed to 75% from the main menu until you get the game's rhythm down.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing! If there are any functionality issues regarding downloading/installing the game, please let me know in the comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb16f122b53e1cff112052be1a3ea088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Snowful"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
