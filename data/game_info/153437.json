Arrows move the ship left and right. X boosts, using fuel at increased rate to cover more distance</p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>Cover as much distance as you can in as low a time as you can. Collect additional fuel to keep your ship running longer. Dodge the obstacles.\u00a0</p>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>This came together nicely, at a nice pace, over about the last five days of the month. I didn't feel desperately under pressure, although I\u00a0came right up against the deadline. Nor did I\u00a0feel like I left out tons of stuff and/or released a worse product for time constraints. I actually managed to squeeze in loads of features I wanted, including probably my favourite PICO-8 music I've done. Top PICO-8 tip: you can set different music patterns to have different speeds but have them play in the same 'song'. Huge missing link moment for me realising that.</p>\n<p>I'm very proud of this game and how it worked out. In particular I\u00a0think</p>\n<ul><li>the battery HUD element</li><li>the little shadow under the ship</li><li>the cliffs flying past on either side</li></ul>\n<p>all felt pretty neat in implementation and look good in practice.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy!
