They aren't alone, the place is swarming with scary walking skeletons, they can't see both of you but if you get really close to them... they will hurt you. You can't fight them so you need to avoid them. The watcher has a laser to point at places so the runner can be guided or the watcher can send a stop message to the runner as a warning.
