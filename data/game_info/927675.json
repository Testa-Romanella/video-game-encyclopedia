You play as a mermaid and have to save all your aquatic friends from those dastardly nets. That's all there is to it, just straight to the point here. Controls are explained in the game itself.</p>\n<p>(<strong>Developer's note:</strong>\u00a0Cutting the nets works best if you're on the sides of them/enter and exit their area first. It's kind of a bug but wasn't really sure how to fix it, if I ever find out how I'll update the game accordingly.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T16:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd18358e8282a8e392da1fef5bdca41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdamGregory03"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
