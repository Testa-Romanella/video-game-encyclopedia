With each click, the bar changes its direction of movement, and a new point may appear in a random place on the path. The number of points that need to be clicked for hacking is equal to the current level at which the player is located. With new levels, the pace of the game accelerates, which will require the player to concentrate on the gameplay as much as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:53:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d1df91c3295687a208690a57284683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simple Logic Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Simple Logic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
