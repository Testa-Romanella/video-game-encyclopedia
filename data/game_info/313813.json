True Tales of Robin Hood", "description": "<strong>The Story</strong><br/>The peasants of Nottingham bow under the weight of Prince John\u2019s taxes; nobles fall to the Sheriff\u2019s political machinations; deserters from the Crusades pillage the land; and fairies lure the unwary into the depths of mist-shrouded Sherwood Forest, never to be seen again. <br/><br/>Step into the chaos of a magical England at the end of the Third Crusade.<br/><br/>Maid Marian hides breathless amidst the brambles after the sack of her father\u2019s castle; Little John charges a bodyweight in gold to cross a lonely log; and Will Scarlet holds court in a brokedown tower surrounded by trees as tall as the sky, waiting for a king who will never come. <br/><br/>The time is ripe, a spark is lit \u2013 from the ashes of your home, from the shadow of anonymity, step into legend. <br/><br/>You are Robin Hood.<br/><br/><strong>The Game</strong><br/>Nocked! is a lushly-illustrated, story-driven role-playing game. Define the deeds and identity of Robin Hood, outlaw of Sherwood Forest; recruit allies, forge alliances, find love; and chart a path between war, negotiation, and dangerous magics.
