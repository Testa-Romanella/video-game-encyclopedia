{"id": 711939, "slug": "pillars-c64", "name": "Pillars (C64)", "name_original": "Pillars (C64)", "description": "<p>Pillars is based on the classic arcade game \u2018Columns\u2019 that was ported to most of the 16-bit home systems - indeed many people would have had it bundled with their Megadrive. However it seemingly never reached the C64 in the shape of either an official conversion or clone. Until now!</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to clear gems by matching three or more of the same colour horizontally, vertically or diagonally. As the gems fall you can move them left and right, or press fire to rearrange them. Create cascading combos to significantly boost your score, keeping an eye on the upcoming gems in order to plan ahead. The game is over when the column that gems arrive into is filled up.</p>\n<p>In 'original' mode you simply aim to survive for as long as possible and get the highest score you can. Every 50 gems cleared increases level, giving a higher score multiplier but also a faster drop speed. If you have less time to spare you can opt for '3 minute' mode, with the aim to score as many points as possible within that time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>'2 player' mode allows two human players to go head-to-head, with the aim to outlast your opponent. In this mode creating combos sends a row of skulls to your opponent's board, raising their gems towards the top and you towards victory. These can be removed by clearing adjacent gems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The settings menu allows you to customise the difficulty of the game, including the ability to give one player a handicap, useful if you are playing against someone with a much higher or lower skill level. There is also the option to change the gem colours to be slightly more distinguishable to those affected by colour blindness, or mute the music.</p>\n<p>The game is available in .d64 format for play on real hardware or an emulator like VICE, MiSTer\u00a0or TheC64. You can also try it out at the top of this page, however depending on your system/browser the audio may occasionally skip.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T07:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/7730e5b14663625d973176c7a6d10113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
