Now that we're graduating, I used this medium to express some (a paltry few) of my feelings pertaining to the game. I also wanted to express my deep gratitude to my friends, not just for playing the campaign with me, but for being their amazing selves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game uses twine, specifically the paloma style by m. c. de marco and some of the examples from the snowman documentation. If you enjoyed this work, consider supporting me (by downloading the game file and donating) or the creators of paloma &amp; snowman.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea50c9ac549fe0887ce2c3902169b193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wbalmer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
