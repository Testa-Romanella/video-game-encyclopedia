The alien creature itself (the difficulty to see droid), has a knife, super human jumping, the ability to cling on to walls, and the ability to sense the presence as well as health of players on the map (dead or alive). The android can also feast on the flesh of dead soldiers to gain health as well as use props to to scare, hurt and taunt the soldiers. <br/><br/>Hidden Unreal is a work in progress and could use your support either via donations or play testing to help make this game as good (and better) than its predecessor.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Join the Discord chat to speak with me and the active community directly\u00a0https://discord.gg/Z8cTdu3</p>\n<p>This project is not affiliated with the original developers of Hidden\u00a0Source.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e782d77831dbca34ef5fe8714df5738f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nonlin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
