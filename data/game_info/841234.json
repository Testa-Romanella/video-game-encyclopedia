It's up to the Bear Witch to stop them.</p>\n<p>In order to stop them you will need honey. Honey works as your energy or mana, casting spells cost honey. To get more honey you will need to help your bee friends get more nectar by planting flowers.</p>\n<p>With your honey you can confront the waves of robots that are trying to destroy the forest. Stop as many as you can before your honey runs out or you take too much damage. With more honey you can defeat more robots.</p>\n<p><strong>In a future demo</strong>, among other things,\u00a0you will need to leave the Bear Witch's comfort zone and befriend the other animals in the Forest.
