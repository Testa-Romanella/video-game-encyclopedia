In early 2021 we decided rather than continue to develop a larger single-player version of the game, we wanted to release the local multiplayer battles for free. We hope you enjoy playing Operation DogFight with your friends. While we do not currently have any plans to add more content to Operation DogFight, we would love to continue developing this game further into our original vision. It will require significant player interest before we do so, so if you give it a try and would love to see more please let us know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:33:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e994f627610c046f61d5508b5ef1488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petricore"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
