At the time of creation, Singapore was undergoing a circuit breaker period, when non-essential services were suspended on the island for one month so as to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mini games are inspired by important precautions that teachers give their students in school - practicing social distancing, avoiding unnecessary purchases, and fighting the war against COVID-19 by playing our part.</p>\n<p>Character and game designs created on Powerpoint and Gamemaker Studio 2.
