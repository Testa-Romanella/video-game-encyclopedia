The main threat in Red Hourglass is a frightening creature that is part black widow spider and part woman. Her young counterpart\u2014a girl who carries an hourglass\u2014acts as her eyes and ears, alerting her to your presence. If the girl spots you, the spider creature will be coming for you immediately. You must run and hide until the threat passes.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a key hidden somewhere in the building, and it will be in a random room each time you play. Find it, and make for an exit. If you're spotted with the key in hand, the following chase will be relentless\u2026 better run!\r\n</p>\r\nThe Story:\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou're tracking down a book written by your ancestor. Your search leads you to an abandoned library at the edge of the forest. So you borrow the key to the building from the care taker and begin searching inside, but the next thing you know you're waking up on the floor. What happened? Did you pass out? It's gotten late, and it's very dark inside. Good thing you brought a flashlight, but you soon discover the doors are locked, and the key is missing. You decide to assume the key is somewhere inside the building and so you go looking for it... but you get the feeling you're not alone anymore.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\r\nDevelopment Note:\r\n<p>I've decided to call this game finished. I've uploaded version 1.0 and I don't think I'll be returning to it. I had a few more ideas but ultimately I think it is a complete enough package.
