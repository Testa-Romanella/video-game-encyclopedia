You come across a large, techie-looking building and head inside, hopeful that you will find charging outlets, or even batteries. You find quite a few, but there\u2019s a problem: they don't energize you enough... You check your levels, realizing you are not going to make it to wherever it was you were going.</p>\n<p>This is your last chance. You commit yourself to searching the building in hopes of finding something long-lasting. On your journey you come across puzzles, other robots ready to battle you for the same thing, and a dawning realization of the stupidity of a society that built completely random tech in a completely random building in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>This game was submitted for the Lost Relic Game Jam 2022.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Move </strong>- WASD<br/><strong>Jump </strong>- Space<br/><strong>E</strong> - Interact<br/><strong>LMB </strong>- Melee<br/><strong>Q</strong> - Equip GunPlug<br/><strong>RMB </strong>- Shoot GunPlug</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p><strong>Hulkmeistercoder</strong>#0598 - Gameplay Programmer<br/><strong>John</strong> - 3D Art @meleejohn4<br/><strong>Lee</strong> - Composer &amp; Sound Designer @doctorlee.audio<br/><strong>Paul</strong> - Art &amp; Animation, stublag.com<br/></p>Bonus<p>PlugBot Adventures Teaser</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ba/1ba14af2f329eff9a6632484c1b350d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hulkmeistercoder", "stublag"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
