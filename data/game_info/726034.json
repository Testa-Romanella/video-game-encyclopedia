Here you will find death lurking around every corner.\u00a0 This is not a horror game, there are just lots of deadly traps, (as in only two variations spread about in different ways). As for the difficulty, there's just no knowing. Sometimes you get 6 rooms and other times 58. Have Fun! (By the way this is a roguelike). This game is best, played in the browser.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aefb1de7793f52e2b113363442bc5f44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mr. Foot"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
