Your arm can only reach\u00a0so far, so make sure you\u2019re not too far from whatever you\u2019re trying\u00a0to interact with! Crouching increases your reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Find the 3 valuables: Diamond, Money &amp; Vinyl.\u00a0Make sure to place the valuables in the car, then once you have everything ready, enter the car and drive away.\u00a0Just remember to open the garage door first.\u00a0You will have to solve puzzles and find items all around the house,\u00a0so think outside of the box!\u00a0You can leave the house and come back the next day whenever you feel like it,\u00a0but don\u2019t waste a day for nothing!</p>\n<p><strong>The owner</strong></p>\n<p>You must avoid the owner at all costs! He has an awareness\u00a0meter that increases the more he suspects that someone is in the house.\u00a0If he ever reaches 100% awareness, he will grab his gun and call\u00a0the police!\u00a0He will go after any noises you make, so be careful! You can drop items on\u00a0carpets to avoid making noise, as well as crouching to avoid floor creaks!\u00a0Noise isn\u2019t the only issue however, if he spots a door open when he\u2019s\u00a0sure he saw it closed last time or vice versa, he\u00a0will become more aware. The more aware he is the\u00a0smarter he\u2019ll become.
