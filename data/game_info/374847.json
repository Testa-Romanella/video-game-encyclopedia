The 3rd GameShell Game Jam (2019Q3), finished within 10 hours (as I only discovered the jam in the last few days and already had other commitment...) But I am glad that i made something playable within this time!</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by the famous polarity shoot 'em up\u00a0Ikaruga. The code used in this game were heavily borrowed from fellow PICO-8 games: A PICO-8 Spaceshooter in 16 GIFs and\u00a0MONOID. Due to the short time, I didn't make much content and the game over effect is buggy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T04:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6539f7a9a7ebea75b77bd598e340d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kirais"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
