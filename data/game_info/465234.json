Your magical cards seem to have a mind of their own and you have lost control of them! Each turn one card will play itself, with or without your consent! The one handle you have on the situation is the ability to discard one card each turn before they go rouge.</p>\n<p>Can you defeat all three challengers? ...\u00a0or will RNG take you to an early grave?!!</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse, A and D Keys, or the Left and Right Arrow keys to select a card</li><li>Discard/Activate a Card using the RETURN / ENTER key, or the left-mouse button</li></ul>\n<p>Gameplay Explanation</p>\n<p>Each turn is built of four phases:</p>\n<ol><li>Draw Phase</li><li>Discard Phase</li><li>Random Phase</li><li>Enemy Attack</li></ol>\n<p>In the Draw Phase, you will draw one additional card, unless you have none, in which case you will be given a spanking brand new card of five cards!</p>\n<p>You will then enter the Discard Phase, where you will choose one of the cards to remove from your hand.
