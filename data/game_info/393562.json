{"id": 393562, "slug": "tabletop-adventures", "name": "Tabletop Adventures", "name_original": "Tabletop Adventures", "description": "Tabletop Adventures is meant to look and feel like an actual role-playing environment that you would setup at home and play with pen &amp; paper, dice, miniatures, map tiles, and imagination. The game uses familiar rules systems and takes you through a generated story with random changes to make things unpredictable for maximum replay-ability. Since the game is single-player, you won't have to find friends with flexible schedules in order to start playing. You control 4 heroes and partake in a voice narrated story in a video game that emulates tabletop board game actions. This is not meant to replace your favorite role-playing game, but to get you through the week while waiting for your next tabletop adventure.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f3b8a53f7c72b31babee87ca30bc2c.jpg", "website": "http://www.almighty-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Almighty Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Almighty Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
