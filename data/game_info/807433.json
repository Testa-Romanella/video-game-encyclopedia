This is my first game.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a simple puzzle platformer, you can move around, push objects, fall, and die (in game, of course).</p>\n<p>The twist, though: The gravity will flip itself every 3 seconds. This mechanic developed several interesting levels!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Definitely try it out if you have some spare time!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>As it is my first game, there should be some bugs contained within it, or it can also be something you simply don\u2019t like.
