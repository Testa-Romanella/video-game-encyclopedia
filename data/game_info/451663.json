Soon you'll feel the nonstop rush exchanging various objects for others. Quickly search in the back room for a replacement item of similar height or volume. Once selected, click the bell to let the customer know you found their new item. If they are happy they'll give you a tip. Pick poorly though, and they may require some money of yours to be appeased. Serve as many customers as you can before you run out of money.\u00a0 Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T02:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed854e098807beffa104eaee71902e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["twopaeks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
