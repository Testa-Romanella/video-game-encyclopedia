The design team needs you to build out an environment generation prototype. The system should work as follows:</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Rooms should vary in size and shape with a minimum of 4 different room types mixing together.\r\n</li><li>There should be a branching path through the dungeon with potential for dead ends and back tracking.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>There should be one boss room per dungeon.\r\n</li><li>Rooms should have placeholder treasure, traps, and/or monsters.\r\n</li><li>There should be a player character with placeholder art and minimum movement mechanics to navigate the environment.\r\n</li><li>The camera should behave differently based on the size of the room. (i.e small rooms have static camera, long rooms have panning camera, large rooms have moving camera bounded to size of room, etc). The camera should show as little of the surrounding rooms as possible.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/5677be23823b5fbf378241a36245874a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ClintonThai", "jake nguyen", "Stephanie Wilhite", "xiaowenxh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
