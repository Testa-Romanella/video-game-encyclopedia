{"id": 384523, "slug": "bolf", "name": "Bolf", "name_original": "Bolf", "description": "Bolf combines the long game strategy of golf with the pin smashing technique of bowling.  Bolf's swing system is easy to get to grips with, but flexible enough to reward practice.  Mouse motions are translated to your bolfer's swing, while manual control of your virtual grip allows you to open up a club face or dig in for a little back spin.  As you play, you'll earn experience to improve your abilities and cash you can use to customize your bolfer's appearance.<br/><br/>Hitting heavy bowling balls hundreds of yards down a fairway can be a surprisingly peaceful way to spend some time!  You'll be treated to beautiful scenery and a relaxing atmosphere while you play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T02:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a2f1ec3ec51b23bee65ce420ad2f6fc.jpg", "website": "http://www.simtenero.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimTenero"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SimTenero"], "esrb_rating": null}
