Travel through time, slay demons, save humanity.</p>\n<p>This infinite runner was developed for\u00a0 the Devtober 2021 Game Jam. Over the course of 31 days, we accepted the challenge to completely design and create an entire game using only our skills and experience. Like how scratch cooking creates an entire meal from only base raw ingredients, we created this entire project from custom made music, art, design, and code. We also publicly published our entire development of this project on Youtube:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Du-kmXDk8RjGJNxWs7ETw.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also play the demo\u00a0HERE</p>\n\r\nEarly Access\r\n<p>This game is in active development.
