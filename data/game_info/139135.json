'n ghosts.</strong> You also compete in different party-style\u00a0 gameplay modes such as <strong>Ballistix</strong> (4-way pong),<strong> Balloon Party</strong> (pop the most balloons), <strong>Frenzy</strong> (enemies and power-ups are everywhere!), and many more. You can also expect <strong>boss battles</strong>, and <strong>\"Adventure Stages\"</strong>, which are... well, I'm not gong to spill the beans on that one just yet.</p>\n<p>The main mode is<strong> Classic Mode</strong>.\u00a0The goal is to simply reach a score of 100, and you gain points by killing enemies and collecting gems. Killing enemies in trickier ways will nab you more points. For example, knocking a bat into a wall isn't worth much. But knocking the bat into an enemy, punching an enemy projectile and having the explosion kill enemies within the small radius are worth more points..</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><em>*an Xbox controller is strongly recommended*</em></p>\n<p>Start/Pause = Enter\u00a0<br/>Exit = ESC<br/>Restart = R<br/>60%/75% Zoom (Toggle) = 1<br/>100% Zoom = 2<br/>Full screen/window mode = F<br/>Navigate menu = Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Keyboard:<br/>Run = Left/right keys<br/>Jump = Z<br/>Standard attack (Punch) = X<br/>Up-attack (Uppercut) = C<br/>Down-attack (Hammers) = Down arrow + X<br/>Roll Left = A<br/>Roll Right = D<br/>Dash attack = A/D + X<br/>Mini dash attack = left/right keys + Q<br/>Down-dash = Down arrow + Z (while in the air)<br/>Wall jump = Z (while on a wall)<br/>Super wall jump = Press Z while still holding left or right while on a wall, but release left or right immediately after pressing Z</p>\n<p>Xbox controller:<br/>Start/Pause = Start<br/>60%/75% Zoom (Toggle) = LT<br/>100% Zoom = RT<br/>Run = D-pad/Left stick<br/>Jump = A<br/>Standard attack (Punch) = X<br/>Up-attack (Uppercut) = B<br/>Down-attack (Hammers) = Down + X<br/>Roll Left = LB<br/>Roll Right = RB<br/>Dash attack = LB/RB + X<br/>Mini dash attack = left/right + Y<br/>Down-dash = Down + A (while in the air)<br/>Wall jump = A (while on a wall)<br/>Super wall jump = Press A while still holding left or right while on a wall, but release left or right immediately after pressing A</p>\n<p>*This is a public demo of a game that's in development and will continuously be updated alongside the main game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/6458974f283fde30c7ca069835d8df25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monster PVRTY"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
