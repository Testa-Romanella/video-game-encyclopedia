Smith Games<br/></p><p>This game was created for the MiniLD #74 CoopJam.</p>\n<p>This was a simple proof of concept game that I created in about four hours to test an idea that I've had for a while.\u00a0 It is a game similar to the classic Ikari Warriors, but you can play as both characters.\u00a0 The game is best played using an XBox controller, but any dual stick controller should work.\u00a0 The left stick controls the red commando and the right stick controls the blue commando.\u00a0 The left bumper button makes the red commando shoot and the right bumper button makes the blue commando shoot.\u00a0 Since the two commandos work as a team, I felt that it fit the theme for the game jam.\u00a0 The game can also be played with two players with the alternate keyboard controls.</p>\n<ul><li>Red Move - A,W,S,D</li><li>Red Shoot - Space.</li><li>\r\nBlue Move - Arrow keys</li><li>Blue Shoot - Ctrl (Right)</li></ul>\n<p>After doing some testing, I found that the controls work really well for one player, until the commandos cross.\u00a0 Somehow my mind naturally assigns the left stick to the left guy and the right stick to the right guy, even though they are color coded.\u00a0 I'm thinking this probably wouldn't be a problem for two separate players each controlling one commando.<br/></p>\n<p>One of the features I planned on adding is having a vehicle that you could put both commandos in, so that one would drive and the other would shoot.\u00a0 I would like to go back and add better graphics and music, as well as making the level scroll upwards as you move forward.\u00a0 Plus, I could add power-ups which could be assigned to the triggers or thumbstick press.\u00a0 It would also be nice to have to way to revive one of the commandos after they are hit.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Subscribe on YouTube | Follow on Twitter | Like on Facebook<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e1/2e1cbded806ce1178b5e4becb891842b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Levi D.
