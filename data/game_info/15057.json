It features an inclusive, politically aware story, with narrative beats about community, identity and activism. It has pretty pixel art and moody music. And it was made by Analgesic studios, the two-person team behind one of my favorite titles of 2013, Anodyne, a beautiful, pointed take on 2D Zelda-style games.<br/><br/>That was always going to speak to me. But what I found in Even the Ocean surprised me even further: It's not just a good game, but a milestone for a sensitive, thoughtful studio working in an uncertain and often downright scary world.\"<br/>-Danielle Riendeau for Waypoint<br/><br/>\"Perhaps even more intriguing, though, is how this energy system affects the logic and culture of Even the Ocean\u2018s world. It makes sense that the tallest city, Whitforge City, and its celestial spire runs on Light energy. Given that it relies on the power plants that Aliph restores to keep running, the city and its Light energy also come to represent industrialism and science.\"<br/>-Chris Priestman for Killscreen<br/><br/>\"Even the Ocean is a shining example of how we should be treating diversity and accessibility in games paired with interesting plaforming challenges.\"<br/>-Affinity Archives Steam Curator<br/><br/>~Youtube Gameplay Footage<ul><li>Even The Ocean (1): Super Accessible, Chill Narrative Platformer by Sir TapTap<br/></li><li>Smash Look! - Even The Ocean Gameplay by Smash GaminG!! - Frazzz</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T02:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f27b557a98434ad8a271cc21f707a2.jpg", "website": "http://www.eventheocean.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 69, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Joni Kittaka", "Sean Han Tani", "Analgesic Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Arcade", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Analgesic Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
