The randomly generated worlds contain progressively stronger enemies, armed with more power the further you venture in. Choose to fight in the exponentially tougher Solo mode, or ask a friend to help you in Local co-op. If that is not enough, you can test your skills in Versus mode to determine who is the ultimate vector once and for all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0501e7dffbb0a0e6a4a4dbc04935b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sino"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
