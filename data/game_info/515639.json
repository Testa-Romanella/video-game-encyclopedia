The only way to obstruct your opponent, if he or she enters a part of the map where there's\u00a0an electric grid in the background, and you happen to be near a big red button. That'll be a shocking experience for your opponent. :)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Player 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Player 2<br/>ARROW KEY LEFT - RIGHT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 A - D\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0: walk left or right<br/>ARROW KEY UP - DOWN\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0W - S\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 : climb up-down or look up-down<br/>R-CTRL or 0/INS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L_CTRL or SPACE\u00a0 : jump</p>\n<p>ESC : menu</p>\n<p>Gamepad controls (both player can play with controllers):<br/>STICKS or DPAD : walk and climb or look up-down<br/>A : jump</p>\n<p>Only splitscreen couch-versus play is possible.</p>\n<p>I built two set of maps, designed by my lovely girlfriend\u00a0Allegra.
