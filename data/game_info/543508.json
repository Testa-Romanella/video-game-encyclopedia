Ad Wars is divided into 3 episodes, each one with it's own type of gameplay. You'll find yourself jumping and shooting the mischievous yet endearing Gengens in Super Freemium Lands, taking on all sorts of monsters RPG-style in Clickbait Kingdom, and unearthing the mysteries of Download Highways, a screwball Maze Crawler section. Oh, and did we mention there's also bullet hell mania?<br/><br/>If there's one thing we encourage the player to have to fully savor Ad Wars, it's an open mind. Traditional -and perhaps untraditional at times- way of thinking might get you to a certain point, but bizarre logic could be what gets you far.\r\n<br/><br/></p>\r\nThat sounds cool! What's the story behind it?\r\n<p>Fate dealt humanity a swift and merciless hand one day. In what came to be known as the Ad-Pocalypse, anti-ad forces fought relentlessly against Ad Corporations but were completely decimated. Now, overrun by ads, the world is far from what it used to be, and it's up to no other than Alt, the sole survivor of this cataclysm, to wage a last stand and free the world from the bane of ads once and for all.<br/><br/>Ad Wars is set on the internet, where portals and vortexes are commonplace. Be prepared, it won't take just a few data packets to end this quest; the virtual road ahead is not just perilous, but long. Alt, however, won't be alone; with the special guidance of the trusty and quirky Magna, whacky characters joining in, and, of course, your help, his chances couldn't be better!<br/><br/></p>\n<strong>Early Access Out Now!\r\n<br/><br/></strong>\r\nSites &amp; More Info\r\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/qxAmdrg</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/adwarsgame\r\n</p>\n<p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE371RpIvg_KrF4QaeHMJLQ</p>\n<p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adwars_/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/38436efd382234f4ff4ee0606556edbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["\u03b1Glitch"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
