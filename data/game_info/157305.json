Bounce off various obstacles and use them to reach your final target in every level. As you progress through the game, the levels become larger and you're given more checkpoints to stop and decide the direction your next launch. Forget about countdowns, scores, points, coins, and other distractions. Also, you can choose from a plethora of themes and characters!</p><ul><li><strong>50 Unique Levels<br/></strong></li><li><strong>11 Free Characters<br/></strong></li><li><strong>11 Free Themes<br/></strong></li><li><strong>No time limit<br/></strong></li><li><strong>No scores<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Unlimited Tries</strong></li></ul><p>Follow us on twitter @_madperception_<br/>Contact us on hello@madperception.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c67bb4bcb2ce8f7fc0a8afee9f6884.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mad Perception"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
