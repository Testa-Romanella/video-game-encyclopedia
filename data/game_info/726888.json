{"id": 726888, "slug": "ana-glyph", "name": "Ana | Glyph", "name_original": "Ana | Glyph", "description": "<p>Made for Global Game Jam 2022 (Theme: Duality)</p>\n<p>Siblings Ana and Glyph got lost in the multiverse through a portal that opened in their world. They soon realized that while traveling through the portal, they acquired the ability to see red and blue elemental spirits. Ana can see water spirits, while Glyph can see fire spirits. Neither one can see all the spirits, so they need to communicate and trust each other. Even though they can't see them, the spirits are still in the world, thus they can still interact with them. Help Ana and Glyph traverse the portals to get back to their world.</p>\n<p>For the best experience, get a friend, play the game in full screen,\u00a0and put a folder between the both of you so that you won't see each other's screen.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Control Ana</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Control Glyph</p>\n<p>R: Restart Level</p>\n<p>M: Toggle Music</p>\n<p>1: Toggle Left Screen (For testing purposes only)</p>\n<p>2: Toggle Right Screen (For testing purposes only)<br/></p>\n<p>0: Skip Level\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Magic Cliffs Environment (https://ansimuz.itch.io/magic-cliffs-environment)\r\n</p>\n<p>Medieval Warrior Pack 2\u00a0(https://luizmelo.itch.io/medieval-warrior-pack-2)\r\n</p>\n<p>Huntress (https://luizmelo.itch.io/huntress)\r\n</p>\n<p>Cute Girl Free Sprites (https://www.gameart2d.com/cute-girl-free-sprites.html)\r\n</p>\n<p>Spell 2 (https://opengameart.org/content/spell-2)\r\n</p>\n<p>Fesliyan\u00a0Studios\u00a0(https://www.FesliyanStudios.com) for footstep sounds\r\n</p>\n<p>Glitch Effect Shader (https://bitbucket.org/arlez80/glitch-effect-shader)</p>\n<p>Stars Shader (https://godotshaders.com/shader/stars-shader/)</p>\n<p>Energy Beams (https://godotshaders.com/shader/energy-beams/)</p>\n<p>Particles (https://github.com/RPicster/Godot-particle-and-vfx-textures/)\r\n</p>\n<p>Screen shake (https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/2d/screen_shake)\r\n</p>\n<p>Signed Distance Field Font\u00a0(https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/gui/sdf_font)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Floating Cities by Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3765-floating-cities\r\n</p>\n<p>License:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51df31c49a5966638c58fe4230ee73c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ubehalaya"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
