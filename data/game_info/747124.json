The last thing she hears before drifting off to dream land is her teacher saying \"...it is impossible to divide by zero!\"</p>\n<p>Influenced by her teacher's statement, dream Oila dared to do the impossible and successfully divided by zero! But alas... there were dire consequences for such hubris, for it opened a portal to HELL! Now Oila must battle her way through imaginary numbers to get back to the waking world, a world where numbers do not attack.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coding </strong>- Mike</p>\n<p><strong>Coding </strong>- Nick</p>\n<p><strong>Sound </strong>- Eli</p>\n<p><strong>Art </strong>- Diana</p>\n<p><strong>Brainstorming </strong>- Andy</p>\n<p><strong>Math Consultant</strong> - Dalton</p>\n<p><strong>Mascot </strong>- Matt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/45492277925186520ee2565422d8b090.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lake Monster Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
