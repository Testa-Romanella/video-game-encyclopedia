This is my first properly published game, so that's cool. It was made in about a week,\u00a0using Godot game engine since its so easy to get a good grasp of. I'm looking forward to\u00a0feedback and advice!</p>\n<p>It's been a long time since I last worked on any projects or messed with\u00a0programming at all, so I thought this could be something simple to get me back into game design. I hope to work on some much bigger projects in the near future.\u00a0I'm sure there will be some bugs or oversights that still\u00a0need fixing. You might experience\u00a0audio crackling depending on your browser, and I'm still trying to figure out what is causing it.\u00a0Though it looks like it might\u00a0be something with the Godot engine itself.</p>\n<p>(Credits to https://ansimuz.itch.io/\u00a0for the art assets and music, as well as\u00a0https://gamesupply.itch.io/ for the sound effects.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/931/931cd851a005912263d2acd4316cc2ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VergiliusMaro"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
