Unravel this mysterious murder turned museum heist with your own two paws, and fulfill your quest for justice.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, and was developed for educational purposes. There will be bugs and several limitations, as it was made entirely in the span of a limited ten weeks. It can only be played currently with a gamepad controller, and in 1080p. There are FPS settings in the menu, but stability is not guaranteed. There is no active save in the game, and relatively little progress to be made. Please enjoy the environment and characters for now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/93800e258b516c756b10f44dbd3626ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EricAllenK"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
