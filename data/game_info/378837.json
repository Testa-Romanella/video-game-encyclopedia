One such solution is PARADISE, a program to which your consciousness is uploaded after your death. But what happens if the upload process goes wrong?</p>\n<p>THE GAMEPLAY</p>\n<p>Have you ever looked at something in the distance that looked smaller than it is, but\u00a0felt like you could easily pick it up or jump over it? In PARADISE you can do exactly that, since depth does not exist for you. Everything is <em>exactly</em> as it seems on your screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To exit the game press F1 to get to the main screen and then F1 again to quit.</p>\n<p>If you try the game and like it (or don't!) and want to help us out we have a short survey you can fill out:\u00a0https://forms.gle/4rNGvPbQBxmtE6gB6.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also join our discord if you want to follow the development here:\u00a0https://discord.gg/eVgcW7m<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Developed by:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Levi Moore\u00a0</li><li>Daniel Hansen</li><li>Camilla Vallentin</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The voice of The Administrator:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>George Bruckshaw</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Art Assets:</strong></p>\n<p>Environment:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sanctuary-62519</p>\n<p>Player:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/character-pack-free-sample-79870, slightly modified<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Soundeffects:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard typing:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Trollarch2/sounds/331656/</li><li>Error sound: Windows XP</li><li>Gabriel turn off sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/458584/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Elevator music: \"Local Forecast\" by Kevin MacLeod\u00a0https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300012</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed986445dd96cda0d07b701329ebbef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrostBandit"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
