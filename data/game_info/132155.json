Face your enemy and strike quickly, just as your opponents strive to crush you in fierce space combat!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYour mind is your greatest weapon: devise a strategy; plan your tactics and engage your adversaries!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nCan you predict how your enemy will strike? Can you outwit your foes? Discover your true self in a battle for the ultimate supremacy.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NEW!</strong> The official Tactical Limit website is up, account sign up is coming soon.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Play Modes</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single Player: <strong>YES!</strong> Train against a drone</li>\n<li>Multiplayer - Single Device: <strong>YES!</strong></li>\n<li>Multiplayer - Local Network: Future</li>\n<li>Multiplayer - Internet: Future</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Game Play</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe battle is played out on a grid with obstacles and is played with a succession of rounds. Each round consists of 3 phases. Unlike most turn based strategy games, players must perform their moves simultaneously.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Phase 1: Strategy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt the beginning of each round players are given a short opportunity to observe the play arena and think about the strategy they wish to use.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Phase 2: Tactical</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter deciding on a strategy players have a limited time to enter up to 5 sequential commands they want their ship to follow including movement, attack and defence.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Phase 3: Engagement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe player's ship follows the tactical commands from the previous phase in an effort to defend themselves and destroy opponents.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tactics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Shields</strong>: Raise shields to defend against laser attacks. Shields last 4 turns (including the turn the shields are raised). If you raise shields in the last turn of a round, they will still be up for the remaining turns in the next round.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lasers</strong>: Fire your lasers to destroy your opponent. If you fire your lasers while your shields are up, then your shields will drop to allow firing. You can not raise your shields again until the initial shield turns have passed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Collisions</strong>: Any collision with an asteroid will destroy a player, regardless of shield state. Two players colliding will mutually destroy each other unless only one has their shields raised. In this case the player with their shields raised will survive.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Idle/Recharge</strong>: Remaining idle will allow your energy reserves to recharge. Shields will still consume energy, but the offset from the idle recharge will result in a lower rate of depletion.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Release Notes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>v0.0.3</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single player mode!
