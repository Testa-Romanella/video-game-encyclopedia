There are some known bugs but I ran out of time, unfortunately. The chair in the kitchen will spawn randomly and the sprite will flicker, so be careful when approaching the table. The final boss only takes one hit and then you have to wait a few seconds for the end sequence to start.\u00a0 I usually run around the room until it starts.\u00a0</p><p>I wanted to do more with it, but hope y'all like wandering around the game anyway.\u00a0Music by VHVS.
