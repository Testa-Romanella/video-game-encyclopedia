Find your way out of some tough battles without throwing a single punch. Pay close attention to your enemies' movements, and make your move. The goal isn't to beat them, but to tire them out enough to make your escape. The game is still in it's early stages, but feel free to leave some constructive comments on how we can improve.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d98320f2d14554c8c555f14d65f7e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vale Softworks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
