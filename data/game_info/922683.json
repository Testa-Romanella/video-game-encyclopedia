I was inspired by videos I had previously watched on dominoes falling, which was always satisfying to me, so I decided to include that in my machine. I also wanted to include more than one ball (or sphere) for more movement, and that is why I built slopes (or slides) for them to gain momentum. I was not sure what the end goal should be, but then I remembered a scene from a show I watched where the characters played croquet. To mirror this, I built a sort of bridge that the last sphere would have to go through in order to complete the game. Afterwards, I also added some color and decoration for aesthetic purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T08:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3f/a3f7255731a83c04ec002e551fc23687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nishma"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
