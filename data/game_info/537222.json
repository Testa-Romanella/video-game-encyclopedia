If you want to move across a certain axis, you have to switch planes and move there. But, then you can't move across the other axis anymore. Things get fun when you start combining different movements, moving diagonally and doing fun trickshots.</p>\n<p>There is a total of 1 intentional easter egg in this game. Also be advised the source code is very spaghetti-like and may be hard to mod.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/694f69293df1f66d969cddff0f362612.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MusicByCameron"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
