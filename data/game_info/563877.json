I hope you can enjoy this little game and if you do, please let me know by posting your highscore and any criticism you may have, it would really make my day!<br/></p>\n<p>It is currently in development, but even though this is just a demo, it reflects how the final game will play, since the only thing left to do is fix some of, and create the art and music for the other seven planned stages. Every time I finish a stage, I will update the demo so you can try it out too!</p>\n<p><strong>Please note you can also download the soundtrack, feel free to remix any song you may like or to use them for videos/other projects, as long as you give me credit!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thank you and have a nice day!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The game supports keyboard, controllers and arcade sticks, at least the ones tested, and you can change the controls in the options menu of the game, but in case you need them, the default controls are:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Left Shift - Focus mode</li><li>J - Accept/Shoot</li><li>K - Back/Encore (Encores are the bombs of this game)</li><li>L - Pause</li></ul>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Use\u00a0your encores\u00a0to\u00a0clear\u00a0the\u00a0screen,\u00a0gaining\u00a0points\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0process!</li><li>Move close to bullets and enemies to gain gracing points!</li><li>Get power notes (red) and unlock power stages to gain damage and spread!</li><li>Enter focus mode to move with more precision and straighten your spread!</li></ul>Hardware specs.:<p>The worst computer I was able to test the game in was a thinkpad x250, if you have one with lower specs than that and are able to run the game, please let me know to update this information. Although I imagine pretty much anything slightly modern or not that modern can run it, since it's just a simple 2D game with a relatively low resolution.<br/></p>\r\nContact:\r\n<p>If for some reason you want to contact me to send me a message or just say hi (which I'd be really happy for), you can find me on twitter or you can send me an email at strellynera at gmail dot com (written like this in case some bot is scanning for email addresses).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:32:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b8/1b84bc5ae5b3fab209cc6c087674f4db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strelly"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
