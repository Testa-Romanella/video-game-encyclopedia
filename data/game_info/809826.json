In fact, she seems more like a danger than an ally...</p>\n<p>You will need to grow something for her to eat, or she will just find her own \"food\", which is obviously not good for you!</p>\n<p>Your goal is to survive 10 days until... help arrives!</p>\n<p>Explore the little Station! Rotating Wheel Stations use the centripetal force of their spin to emulate earth's gravity, which means there is no \"up\" or \"down\" just a long, lonely, quiet hallway!</p>\n<p>Thank you for landing on my page, and thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f6719a47c440ab8aa427955b8c45d70f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HectoCacto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
