{"id": 863721, "slug": "on-dark-terms", "name": "On Dark Terms", "name_original": "On Dark Terms", "description": "On Dark Terms in an online co-op open-world horror set in a post-apocalyptic world where you have signed a contract with the dead to acquire protection in the form of a cat to look over your spirit while you attempt to investigate and discover a way to push back the Darkness. You\u2019ll search abandoned buildings, houses, and other desolate places looking for med kits and caffeinated drinks to help prevent your mind and body from succumbing to the Darkness. You\u2019ll need to use equipment carried in your backpack to search for evidence in the deadliest locations on the map while you attempt to avoid falling asleep, losing your mind, and becoming victim to the entities that lurk there.<h3>Key Features:</h3><br/><strong>\u2022\tOpen World:</strong> On Dark Terms is completely open world and you are encouraged to explore as much you can as you will need caffeinated drinks to keep you awake and adrenaline to keep you sane while you investigate dungeons.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tExploration:</strong> The world is quiet, dark, and eerie but there are a few things you\u2019ll need to help you survive your journey into the Darkness. Explore the world through 2 perspectives: You and your Cat. Just as you can walk into a gas station and find some nearby lighter fluid, so too can your cat explore locations that you are not able to. Explore from your cat\u2019s perspective and see what you can find, but be wary, your cat will not follow you into Dungeons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tDungeons:</strong> Dungeons are a new take on horror investigations as they are completely open-world and can all be active simultaneously as each one is considered \u201cHaunted\u201d or \u201cActive\u201d based on whether there is a player inside or not. Activity Levels represent Easy mode when equal or below 50% and Hard Mode when above 50% where Hard Mode can only be initiated with a reusable item that you unlock. Dungeons scale their difficultly and \u201cScariness\u201d based on the number of players inside to help balance the single VS multiplayer experience. <br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tCharacter/Bunker Customization:</strong> By exploring and unlocking achievements you\u2019ll gain access to a variety of cosmetics and props that can be used to either customize the look of your character or customize the look and feel of your personal bunker.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tStory</strong> Not much is known about what happen to this world. What is \u201cThe Darkness\u201d? Why did we sign and accept the terms to a dark contract and put ourselves in danger? You\u2019ll have the option to complete story objectives to learn more about the lore behind it all. There\u2019s so much to tell and plenty of time to tell it.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tCo-op multiplayer: </strong> Play with up to 4 people where coordination is your best chance at survival. The more people you have in your group, the more dangerous the investigations become. <br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tEvidence:</strong> Evidence is the key to gaining experience and learning about the Darkness, but Evidence itself is dangerous. Knowing the Entity is just the cherry on top. There are 10 different evidence categorized into 3 Types. For example, Type 1 Footprints has a different behavior when interacting with it than a Type 2 Footprint. In addition, all evidence has \u201crare\u201d properties that can only be found when Dungeon Activity is above 50 and grants a higher reward. Can you gather enough evidence and confirm the entity\u2019s identity before you succumb to the Darkness?<br/><br/><strong>\u2022\tInvestigate:</strong> You\u2019ll make use of some familiar devices such as a Night Vision Camera, EMF, Spirit Box, Thermometer, and UV light (a separate item combined with your normal shoulder flashlight that does not take up a slot) to find evidence. With a handy backpack, you can easily swap out your items, but you are restricted to holding 2 primary devices and 1 consumable item on your quick slot at a time.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T03:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/31878d353e13a751522c0640e2b1e194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 451, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dimensionless Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dimensionless Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
