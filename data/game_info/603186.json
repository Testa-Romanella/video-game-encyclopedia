The town mayor had claimed of ominous ghost-like beings wandering through the town as the sun hides behind the clouds. When there is daylight, the spirits wander back into the forest in a singular direction. There seem to be multiple types of spirits of differing shades. What might their coloration indicate?<br/></p>\n<p>The mayor tells Finian he is aware of an abandoned residence in the same direction that the entities stride. He points Finian towards it while explaining that no one else in the town is equipped to handle such an exploration.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This job seemed just like any other he had been on before, and Finian had the skills necessary to complete the task. While he had dealt with his fair share of ghouls, werewolves, and other such monsters, his own inventions meant he could compete with them with similar abilities. That being said, the truths the manor and its main inhabitant hide may prove to be much more than anything Finian could have prepared himself to find.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredit\r\n<p><strong>Nicole Jansen:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Narrative, Game Design, Character Development, and Environmental Art</em></p>\n<p><strong>M.
