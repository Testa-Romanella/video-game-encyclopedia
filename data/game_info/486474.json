Although the game is in Spanish, don't worry, as there are almost no texts. The rest of my games are/will be in English.</p>\n<p>Maybe I upload more levels and fix bugs in next updates, but I don't promise anything.</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS:</em></strong></p>\n<p>-In the menus, press W and S to move up/down and SPACE to confirm your selection</p>\n<p>-Some buttons in the menus work by clicking with the mouse on them</p>\n<p>-The controls to play are explained in-game</p>\n\n<p>Hollow Neko (c) 2019-2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/434d00398516de46979d0e35d68a310b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hollow Neko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
