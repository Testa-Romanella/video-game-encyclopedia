(only during the rating period of the jam: Press \"M\" to simulate Web Monetization).</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong><br/>You just created your first game, however it is still pretty <strong>RAW</strong>. Due to a coding error you somehow got caught in your own game and need to reach the exit and escape. To do that you first need to <strong>UNRAWIFY</strong> your game: Go to a breakpoint, add a new feautre and create a new build. Repeat that until you are able to reach the exit. Good Luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and Tools:<br/></strong>GitHub Page<br/></p><p>Framework:\u00a0Phaser 3<br/>Web-Monetization:\u00a0Coil.com<br/>Code: Home made spaghetti code using\u00a0WebStorm<br/>Bundler: vite.js<br/>Graphics: Hand painted using Aseprite<br/>Sound:\u00a0All by myself :)\u00a0using\u00a0Reaper, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 interface, a Kala U-Bass and a Gibson SG Special.<br/>Gamedev Knowledge: Zenva Academy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/deb0fba80b9622bd15976c7139954be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stiggstogg"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
