This bird spends his days chilling in his totally escape-free cage, playing with his totally sick, super awesome high value toys that the humans gave him for their own twisted amusement. They may amuse the humans, <br/>but bird has had enough. Bird wants something more. <br/><br/>\"How would you like to be stuck in a cage all day?\" sings the bird. <br/><br/>\"AWWWWWH IT's SO CUTE!! EEKKK!!\" says the human. <br/><br/>They just don't get it. . . they just don't understand. . . No matter how many pieces of cake, no matter how many high-tech jetpacks or fancy shoulder mounted missile cannons. . . No matter how many deadly spike traps, floating platforms, or iridescent exploding targets. . . It means nothing without FREEDOM. . . <br/><br/>Sing it out bird. Sing your heart out. Teach them what it means to suffer, make them understand through your music. . . <br/><br/>Maybe one day soon you too, will finally be free. <br/><br/>Move with WASD. Use the numbers 1-8 to sing notes. Sing to the humans to get them to get them to give you more toys and let you out of your dingy little bird prison. <br/>You go bird. You're a cool guy; we got your back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a43ba6e5763f4553a63d6ace55910d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Kline"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
