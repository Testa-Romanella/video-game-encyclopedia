With the three of them being immortal, however, this will prove difficult. The enemy is clever, and though our heroes are skilled, one is lazy (but very cool, he has sunglasses), and the other is reckless (but a 1337 h4x0r.)</p>\n\n<p>Look, I'm gonna be real with you buddy, we're pretty much doomed, aren't we, like we these heroes really ain't it..</p>\n\n\n\n\n<br/>\n\r\nProject Piso!
