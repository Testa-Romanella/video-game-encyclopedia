According to the game's storyline, the United States is unable to respond to the attack directly due to the dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal.</p>\n<p>The game is famous in Finland due to the political effect of its content. A leftist member of the Finnish parliament went as far as to make a parliamentary question about whether it was acceptable to sell the game that might cause vexation in a neighboring country Soviet Union with which relations were carefully managed.
