A (very) simple, turn-based strategy game that plays on only a 5x3 grid. Your goal is the destroy/capture your opponents base using your race's hero/avatar. The hero's strength is determined by the size of their kingdom (number of tiles controlled). Didn't have time to really create the AI that I had hoped, so don't expect a challenge. The \"+\" ability uses your turn to increase all occupied tiles by 1 (has a cooldown that increases with each use). I was happy to complete a \"working\" entry, but am not thrilled with the final result. I do not see myself continuing with this project beyond the jam. Thanks for playing and make sure to leave a comment to let me know your thoughts.<br/></p><p>You can find my entry page here. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256976b451f6f4b7b708301a5dda73e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["anarbitrarymustache"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
