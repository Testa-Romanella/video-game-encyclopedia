I remade it to have all the games I ever did working on modern PCs.</p>\n<p>I hope you have a little fun with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a58be2be3f6be1e8f141c60a5ba67858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fuegerstef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
