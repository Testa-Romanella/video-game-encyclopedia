One player tries to create a cavity by spreading germs on teeth (using the mouse) while the other player fights back \u2013 brushing the germs away with a tooth brush (using the keyboard).</p><p>This game was created in <em>less than 48 hours </em>during the Global Game Jam 2016. All sounds were created only by using our mouths \u2013 seriously!</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p><p> - Follow the instructions pop-up at the beginning of the game.<br/>\u2013 No area of the teeth can contain more than 4 germs at a time.<br/>\u2013 The further the tooth is from the center of the mouth \u2013 the tougher it is (it takes longer for the germs to make a cavity). Center teeth are most vulnerable.<br/>\u2013 Press ESC to go back to menu screen.<br/>\u2013 If your webpage moves up and down when controlling the tooth brush using the arrow keys \u2013 you can either go into full screen mode (bottom right button) or cinematic mode, or use the WASD keys to control the brush.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76ea7186cdde837341ce4aaa26039e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Shalyt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
