I'm Masa Murda! Once upon a time my people were traveling through space trying to find a new planet to live on because we totally wrecked our old one. We landed on some skunky world right before we ran out of fuel.

Pretty sweet, right!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Governor Faleena Dancy has the super-fun job of handling the cannibal lotteries each month. She's got a lot of incentive to get things right, because our cannibal friends threatened to eat her if she screws up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actually, they'll eat all of us if she screws up. Did I mention they turn into berserk monsters when they get too hungry? They rampage and start eating people alive--it's hilarious!</p>\n<p>Faleena's actually pretty good at her job--probably too good, because we colonists hate her. Her best friend is one of the cannibals!\u00a0</p>\n<p>People figure Faleena's a cannibal sympathizer and talk about revolting all the time. As if she didn't have enough problems!

To the surprise of everyone, Faleena not only accepted her husband's former post, but appears to be governing in favor of the cannibals who ate him. The reasons why are likely only known by her closest friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor. Faleena does her best to govern the colony while raising the baby born after her husband's death.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Provider Emissary Dal-Tor</strong>\r\nDal-Tor is the intermediary between the cannibals and humans and spends most of her time in Faleena's office. Thousands of years old, she's found meaning in the deep relationship she has with Faleena and her daughter. Both cannibals and humans question what her true interest is in Faleena.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Vice Governor Malek</strong>\r\nWhile the governor is appointed to her seat, the vice governor Malek was elected by the people. He always places their concerns over that of the cannibals, causing him to often butt heads with Faleena. Malek's power is limited, but he uses his influence as best he can.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Assistant to the Vice Governor Sharin</strong>\r\nSharin is technically Faleena's assistant also, but has shown a strong preference toward serving Malek over her. At 75 years old Sharin is deeply troubled by a policy that switches a younger lottery winner with a parent or grandparent. Faleena's support of this policy has caused strife between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lord Crieghton, Ruler of the Providers</strong>\r\nCrieghton is the cannibal Faleena must answer to when she takes risks with the lotteries. His goal is to feed his 34 people as much food as possible, and he resents the small rations they endure while the colony grows. Crieghton can order the 'Sacrificial Replacement' of Faleena if she breaks any of the rules in the agreement made between the colonists and Providers.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lottery Commissioner Gray</strong>\r\nGray has the unenviable job of facilitating the sacrifices after a lottery winner is chosen. His weight is not an issue to him, but he wishes he didn't have to deal with Dal-Tor constantly mentioning how much she wants to eat him. \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Media Liaison Zalby</strong>\r\nZalby's job is to coordinate between the governor's office and the colony press. It's unknown if they are loyal to Faleena or Malek, but the news that airs about Faleena is primarily negative.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ednea</strong>\r\nNow close to one year's old, Ednea is the baby girl Faleena learned she was pregnant with shortly after her husband died.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>News Editorializer Masa Murda</strong>\r\nMasa Murda's official job is making Faleena's life difficult by reporting on her in the worst light possible. While the other news anchors maintain an air of objectivity, Masa is happy to make edgy jokes at the governor's expense. Her unofficial job is to give players puzzles and talk to them after they get an ending.\u00a0</p>\r\nPlease Support our\u00a0Kickstarter\u00a0or\u00a0Indiegogo!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/14822c94d22542d2236c3c8e869acdc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Y Press Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
