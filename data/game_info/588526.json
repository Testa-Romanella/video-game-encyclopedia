It is said that the Most Eggy One - the first person to encounter an egg - was overcome by its majesty and took it upon themselves to share that with the world. And how fortunate we are that they did.</p>\n<p>Since the first Eggmas King was appointed, there have been countless Eggmas Feasts, each as extravagant and delicious as the last. But where would an Eggmas Feast be without any eggs? That is where you come in. As an Eggmas Supplier of the Realm, by appointment to His Majesty the Eggmas King, it is your sacred duty to fulfill the Eggmas order and provide the most exquisite variety of eggs to be feasted upon. <br/></p>\n<p>May your eggs be many and your yolks pure, honourable Eggmas Supplier!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><em>This is just a fun little experience made over a month or so dev-time.
