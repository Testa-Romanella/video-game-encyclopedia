In this game, you will be playing as a detective exploring a town where the residents have mysteriously been getting killed. You will be finding every last detail you possibly can find in each house leading up to the full story. Let me explain, In each house, you will be searching for evidence by solving puzzles that uncover evidence of what is going on. It will be like parts so for example, 1 house gives part 1/8 of the story for example. This game will also be open world and have many secrets, It's somewhat inspired by Hello Neighbor 2 except a bit of stuff\u00a0is different for example there being no AIs, Also there's no story for each and every house. Hopefully I wrote this message somewhat right.<br/><br/>Enjoy the demo!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Credits to AGW for the themes</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T04:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a962c732e6d1ad07be8011ed044897ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrTreeGuyGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
