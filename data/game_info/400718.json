Whichever team has\u00a0 last man standing wins.</p>\n<p>The game supports Lan play, and can be played over the net using Hamachi, at least we were able to when testing here. Just put the IP of the host when joining and everything should work... hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>Yule Bash is a game made in a month to see if we could get our heads around multiplayer while making something fun in time for Christmas.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>;</p>\n<p>Action\u00a0 - Xbox [ B ] / Left Click<br/>Pickup &amp; Drop - Xbox [ X ] / Right Click<br/>Jump - Xbox [ Y ] / Space<br/>Struggle - Xbox [ All ] / The above<br/>Note when carrying items jumps must be charged rather than being instantaneous.</p>\n<p><em>Controller is recommend over mouse and keyboard for best play</em></p>\n<p>We're a brother and sister team - we design and make all of our games together and put pretty much all our demos and gamejams on itch.io to play for free, so check them out and please let us know what you think, so we know what to improve and which game to make next!</p>\n<p>To see more of our work, and updates on our other projects, follow us here;</p>\n<p><em>https://twitter.com/BirdmaskStudio</em></p>\n<p><em>https://www.birdmaskstudio.com/</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:34:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70d2e317b4497729b73b1a236b68848a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BirdmaskStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
