I originally conceived of this project to be a simple, harmless thing to work on whilst I figured out how to focus on game development without the aid of my ADD medication (which I'm trying to drop for multiple reasons), but unfortunately I still can't seem to get any kind of work done on it without the meds. It kinda sucks not being able to pursue my game development passion without the aid of this stuff, but I continue to give it my best efforts.</p><p>Regardless, I hope you enjoy what I have to show thus far! Some feedback and overall encouragement would be much appreciated. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc2aefa3e84f8498f212bc41e0ca797b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jennifer Raye"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
