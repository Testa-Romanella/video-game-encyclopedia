You will need to \"Color Smash\" the in coming waves of astro minions, only to quickly find out your initial \"inputs\" are not what they seem. Its a puzzle to figure out but if your witty enough you'll figure it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being that it is my first game\u00a0ever created and my first publish\u00a0I whish I could have added more mechanics and features that would have made it easier and fun for the player. I have coded, designed, and came up with this little concept to the best of my abilities being an individual dev.\u00a0Current state its a steady one shot game.
