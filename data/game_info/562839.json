{"id": 562839, "slug": "rabbit-man-3d", "name": "Rabbit-Man 3D", "name_original": "Rabbit-Man 3D", "description": "<p>Rabbit-Man 3D is a first person shooter made with the Raycasting Game Engine. You play as the Rabbit-Man in this bloody adventure to save your father from the evil cult of Dale! Go through the halls of your now monster infested home, the mines underneath them, and several other areas. Fight your way to the evil temple of Dale and save your father.</p>\n<p>This is a fairly short game I made last year to play around with FPS game design. The engine I made it on is very limiting, so I made a focused 5 level experience with only one boss. It is also kinda difficult, so the best advice I have for you is LOOK AT YOUR MAP! This is the most recent update to it (version 1.1.0) and because I lost a lot of the files that went with it, but it is playable and polished to the best of my ability. Just be sure to turn the sfx up, because for some reason they're all the way down.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thanks for playing and if you want, try out the\u00a0Rabbit-Man Rpg Demo.</p>\n<p><strong>Read the comic that started it all!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e5cb7ba1bb7f6225dcefca7710585c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jankie Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
