How many people would actually survive, how many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series of questions, and through your answers, will let you know your chances of surviving in the realm of the dead! Would you survive the combat? Would you survive the politics? Would you continue on into the new world?<br/>Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim of looters, bandits, or worst of wall...
