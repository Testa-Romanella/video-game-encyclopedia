Using an intricate FMOD sound system it plays the custom composed songs of the minstrels intermixed with tavern sounds. People cheering, talking, pints of ale being filled.</p><p>The initial mechanics are simple. Combine tiles of the same value. But as the player progresses to higher scores they will learn that one wrong move can end the game, and careful planning is rewarded.</p><p>Not sure what to do? Swipe a white tile in the same direction a bunch of times and see what happens.</p><p>____</p><p><em>Welcome to the Hexjack inn stranger, come in come in.<br/>Close the door, come warm yourself by the hearth!<br/>Have you come for a game?<br/>People come far and wide to see what the wizard came up with this time.<br/></em><em>I think he dropped his deck of cards in the kettle with this one, intentional so he says, phah.</em></p><p><strong>How high can you score before you fill the board?</strong> </p><p>Stylized to look low resolution, with an eye pleasing colour palette.</p><p>It was created using Unity and FMOD Studio.</p><p>- Game by Michel Mohr|<br/>- Music &amp; Sound by MereMonkey</p><p>http://michelmohr.me/<br/>http://meremonkey.com/<br/>Site: http://michelmohr.me/hexjack/</p><p>Older devices may have performance issues.
