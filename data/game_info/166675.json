This work can as well be considered as just an application of the algorithm of static gestures recognition.<br/></p><p>There are lots of other uses of this algorithm. For example, in magic games the player can be given the opportunity to cast a spell as a sequential combination of different gestures (as in my favourite game Magica), or perform various operations on the object using just gestures and without any need to open a context menu. <br/></p><p>The app currently supports two languages (American and Russian) and one experimental mode with various assumed gestures such as: Like, Dislike, Lizard etc. While in a SandBox mode user can as well add his own gesture.</p><p>Also available on Github pages<br/></p><p>The source code and the installation instruction can be found in official repository</p><p>Also available as a single library gesturio.js</p><p>Dear C# developers, this library needs your help to be rewritten on C# =)</p><p>Some information about the recognition method.</p><p>In conclusion it's worth mentioning that precision of gesture recognition depends on the quality of gesture capture done by LeapMotion controller. The current level of quality of gesture capture is enough for successful recognition of the majority of gestures. But there are some gestures that are difficult to recognition (distinguish the gesture meaning \"S\" from the gesture \"A\" or the gesture \"V\" from \"K\", \"M\", \"N\").<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/93991bea66b2a83d8f2a71510a8c654c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aitem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
