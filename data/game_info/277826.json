Until now.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<ul><li>Mouse to move.</li><li>'F' to toggle fullscreen.</li><li>'Escape' to exit game.</li></ul>\n<p>The goal of this game is to get as high of a score as you possibly can. Enemies slowly advance as you defeat them. You will face up to 4 bosses every 500 points (Final boss is at 2000 points). Upon beating the fourth boss you enter 'Infinite Mode' which is exactly what it sounds like. Unlimited waves of enemies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/21403ab6c99457613a54d60cbfbc40a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RadiantKvothe"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
