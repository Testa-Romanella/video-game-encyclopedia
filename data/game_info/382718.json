Be warned that it is quite dark and blatant in the depictions of such.</p>\n<p>Torturing. Causing pain and suffering. Taking screams and tears from a completely subdued human being.<br />\nThat&#39;s the hobby of people from a community called The Dungeoneers. Dungeoneers have their own private dungeons in their homes (hence the name), to which they take strangers - those naive enough to fall for the dungeoneer&#39;s charms.<br />\nMembers from this community won&#39;t settle for just executing their sadistic game. They must show it to other people. For that, they videotape their torture sessions and post it to online forums, to get other member&#39;s appreciation and reviews.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-13T15:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d341ad8997b998470d642dd26ab365.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/2068/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
