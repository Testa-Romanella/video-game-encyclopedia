Looking into strange, cubicle worlds! <strong>Cubic Explorer</strong> is a procedural game about a Magical space dude! Travel through different cubic worlds, and full-fill different objectives!. Enemies and item will react differently, according to random parameters. Random planets, keys, mystery boxes, conditions and objectives await you!</p> How we made this game <p>One of the central ideas of this game was to use a framework I developed for my master's thesis. Right now its called it <strong>MaruGen</strong>, which means <strong>MA</strong>chinations <strong>RU</strong>leset <strong>GEN</strong>erator.</p><p>I took ideas from the concepts of <strong>Micro-Machinations</strong> and <strong>Mission/Space</strong> frameworks by Joris Dormans, an created a tool that can be used to \"generate\" Worlds, mechanics and objectives, given a series of user defined rules and a series of packaded rulesets executed in a certain order to create procedural spaces and mechanichs.</p><p>The idea is to find a way to explore the concept of <em>\"emergence in games\"</em>, mainly described by Dormans in his frameworks, and by other game designer such as Keith Burgun and Raph Koster. And in the end this is an attempt to codify those frameworks and ideas in a possibly useful tool.</p><p>I will upload the source code of this game and <strong>MaruGen</strong> soon. I may just want to rest a little before\u2026</p>Changelog <ul><li><em>Fixed an issue with some worlds not loading due to many doors on a single cube! so sorry (T ^ T). Also added way more item and enemies to find :)</em></li><li><em>Fixed another issue of a mysterious empty planet appearing. Won't happen anymore. Sorry!</em></li><li><em>And finally some balance changes and more small fixes</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb7eab9fd350ae42c9e0ba1f36405532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["glitchypixel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
