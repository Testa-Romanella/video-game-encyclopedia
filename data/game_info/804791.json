VR", "description": "<h3>What is Bocce?</h3>Bocce ball is an ancient and simple game about getting your balls closest to the target. Players throw out a small ball called a pallino and then two teams take turns trying to get their balls closest to it, blocking, knocking, and blasting each others' balls in the process.<br/><br/><h3>Simple enough, so what makes it so fun?</h3>The game is incredibly dynamic! The pallino can land anywhere in bounds and every ball can impact the others, resulting in an ever shifting playing field where the target can change with every throw. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, and when millimeters can make the difference between defeat and victory, individual skill really shines!<h3>Okay, tell me about Bocce Time!</h3>In Bocce Time! you'll head down to a beautiful park with a half dozen different bocce courts. You can jump into a quick match to 1v1 a random opponent online, create and join private rooms with up to 4 players, or play against AI across 3 difficulties to unlock additional ball customization options. With full cross-play, everyone's invited to join the fun!
