Once Levi managed to travel to the past, he equipped himself with weapons to counter the Nazi advance, standing in the center of the square where they had already generated a large bonfire to start the holocaust of books. Levi was sure not to allow any copies to be burned and to eliminate any Nazi who took a book to burn. Will Levi be able to prevent the literary massacre? Will he Rescue all the copies or will he die along with the books? <br/></p>\n<p>Trello - Link</p>\n<p>Repositorio - Github<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T16:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a82653de2ffe7d8e16997133d7967e17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GustafDev", "Fabian Tobar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
