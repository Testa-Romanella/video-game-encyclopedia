The movement didn't translate to 3D well, my models are horrible, and while trying to make the camera less spazzy I made it way worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, the goal is a coin and not a fly as it was in the original game because I didn't want to model a voxel fly because that sounds hard.</p>\n<p>It's not finished, I just don't want to keep working on it.
