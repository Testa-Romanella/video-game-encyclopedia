We created this goofy little red six eyed reptile character and put him in all kinds of wacky situations.\u00a0 We filled binders and binders full of drawings and comics of him. It became such a phenomenon that both of our families would celebrate the day of his first comic every year, June 9th. Usually one of us would create a drawing. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>It's also a way to remind myself not to get too serious about life. Spezy is the screwball voice of irresponsible whimsy. I think it's important for all of us to listen to that once and a while.</p>\n<p>In the tradition, this year I've chosen to create a videogame to celebrate him.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T13:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c27a274be83e566e18d7c21b30770719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amon Twentysix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
