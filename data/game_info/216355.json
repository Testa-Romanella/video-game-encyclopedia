You heard the news of one caretaker in this industrial facility who has gone insane and killed all of his co-workers. Now, the urban legend is that this \u201ccaretaker\u201d has returned to this industrial facility and people has seen this \u201cmonster back to life\u201d. You want to uncover this myth. You are hungry for truth and maybe this caretaker is hungry for something else.<br/><br/><strong>Visuals variety as immersive horror experience :</strong><br/>The visual variety of Caretaker chapters are closely linked with the narrative arch of the game. The environments will reflect the \u201clevel of dangerously insane mind of a caretaker\u201d. As you travel to the lower basements, which acts like a metaphor of \u201cgoing down the depths of human mind\u201d, the environments will reflect the \u201clevel of dangerously insane mind of a caretaker\u201d. <br/><br/><strong>Environmental story telling :</strong><br/>Since we play an investigative journalist, every piece of clue we find regarding the background story will be more rewarding to the player and will also help the player solve basic puzzle in order to progress within the game. The more the player explore the environments, the more he/she will experience the psychosis of this criminally insane mind of the \u201ccaretaker\u201d and therefore the player will form some sort of metaphysical connection with this \u201cevil nemesis\u201d thus seeing and experiencing whole different plethora of hallucinations. All of this narrative experience will not be told via cut-scenes or voice-overs, rather throughout carefully placed environmental clues, for the player to uncover and explore. We deliberately omitted using of cut-scenes and voice-overs in order to create more \u201cimmersive horror experience\u201d for the player.<br/><br/><strong>Brutal A.I</strong><br/><br/>Without spoiling much, you should only know this : If you sense or hear anything dangerous or sinister, just run and hide. Try not to get caught. Really. In Caretaker, you really don't want to get caught.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4aca55a24dc0b4fb48ada6a7a955afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PulseTense"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["PulseTense"], "esrb_rating": null}
