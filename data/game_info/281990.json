{"id": 281990, "slug": "alpha-strike-deluxe", "name": "Alpha Strike Deluxe", "name_original": "Alpha Strike Deluxe", "description": "OVERVIEW\r\n<p>Alpha Strike Deluxe is a shoot-em-up in the classic NES style. Shoot your way through 5 levels, destroy everything that moves and save the world from danger. It's a remake of my 2016 game Alpha Strike (available in the Adrian Makes Games Collection), now with better code, silky smooth 60FPS and swanky graphical effects!</p>\r\nWHAT WAS CHANGED?\r\n<p>- <strong>no more grid!</strong> Every object in the game moves smoothly and isn't bound to the grid now!<br/>- <strong>separate scores and lives for both players!</strong><br/>- graphical improvements! <strong>New sprites for all enemies, some terrain sprites, and swanky graphical effects like trails and explosions!</strong> No more 8x8 explosions and tiny spaceship trails!<br/>- <strong>balance fixes!</strong> The difficulty curve is now smoother and the game is a bit easier (but not too easy!)<br/>- that new-fangled fancy <strong>60FPS</strong> thing you apparently wanted! Back in the 90s, everyone was happy with 30FPS and no one complained!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Pico-8 D-Pad/arrow keys - move ship<br/>Pico-8 <strong>(X)</strong> button/X key - shoot bullets</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<p>Every 10000 points net you an extra life.<br/>Collect powerups to enhance your weapon.<br/>When you die, you lose your weapon.<br/>When you get a game over, you can use one of the two continues you have.<br/></p>\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n<p>1.0<br/>- initial public release<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>(CC) 2019 Adrian Makes Games. </strong>Crafted with love (and Pico-8) in Poland.
