The end result was something a bit more silly and fun, with sea critters. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tInputs: \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tLeft/Right arrow keys for movement \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSpace for dropping depth charge barrels \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tKill the subs, try to protect the sea creatures, and see how long you can survive. I hope you enjoy. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHint #1: The submarines still fire torpedoes for a short time after dying, and disappearing below the screen. As they are sinking to the ocean floor below.<br/>\r\n\tHint #2: The more marine life you kill, different messages appear on the menu screen.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b48d7de426a6aacb2915a9850794de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dlw"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
