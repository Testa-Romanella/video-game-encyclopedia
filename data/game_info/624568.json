Luckily you have your <strong>Space Bunny Suit 3000XTreme</strong> at your side (or more like all around you). To make it easy for bunnies to use this suit it only has one button, the <strong>space button </strong>(space bar). So in this game you controll your character by using only the space bar. Pressing it in different patterns will lead to different actions.</p>\n<p>Hope you can get through all four stages!</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: On some devices you might have to zoom out a bit. Or just use the full-screen mode!<br/></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: In case you feel like you cannot jump. Press SPACE shorter. Like REALLY short. If there is a long bar above the player instead of a dot, then you are pressing to long.<br/></p>\n<p>We did (pretty much) all the code and art. Music is from opengameart.org made by these lovely guys:<br/><em>xeon 6 - bart<br/>at work - HorrorPen<br/>Delusion - Alexandr Zhelanov</em></p>\n\n<p>SoundeEffects were also not done by us.
