I invite you to comment on your opinion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79d9f251240549504264705177ed601.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bryan Bonilla"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
