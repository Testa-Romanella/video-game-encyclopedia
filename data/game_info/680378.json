He is an amazing creature that synthesizes sunlight and pollution into water and energy. The challenges of the first stage are to clear the path of light and consume the debris to clear the path. In this version we use Blurty as an enemy, and we test solar mechanics. We will publish gdd and continue the project after Jam. =)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Ivan - kagg.ivan@gmail.com - Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Dan - Dan.art.wit@gmail.com - Gamedesign<br/></p>\n<p>Brian - brianrrichter@gmail.com - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Loi - allissonrey@protonmail.com - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>\n<p>JOhnny -\u00a0johnnyax@hotmail.com\u00a0-\u00a0colors of animation Gale</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6e3818d0fd8ad985b7227c2c3deda9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["purpleenemy"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
