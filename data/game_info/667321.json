Set in a post-post apocalyptic world, robots have ALMOST completely wiped out the zombies. Come to find out, the zombies have been friendly this whole time. Your job is to go suck up the zombies and deposit them into the UFO. Zombie-kind is counting on you. Kill some robots while you're at it! There are some issues with the HTML version that aren't present in the downloadable version such as clipping in the audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25001362e4b1a2c8e1c1c60e6a7abac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["WhumpbackHale"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
