You can only invade 1 territory at once. Taking 1 pixel of empty space gives you 1 power. Taking 1 pixel from an enemy takes away 1 power from you and the enemy. When someone reaches 0 power, they are gone and their territory becomes empty space ( get power from it ). Power goes up over time too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a87/a872228d049a79b0df25881427c9f870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaxMakesGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
