A Quirky Time Quiz</strong> is an unusual quiz that is the ultimate test of your memory! After aliens abduct you to space, you must remember new, shared knowledge and then test it in high speed. Can you keep up long enough to survive?\r\n </p>\n<p>The game offers numerous funny or interesting facts or pieces of information to memorize as well as pictures and sounds, and over 100 questions and challenges to test your skills. The assignments become progressively harder as you progress. Also most questions don\u2018t come directly after the information, so your memory needs to work extra hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Another great bonus: You can change the folders and files in \"resources\" yourself to create your own, custom questions!)<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>The entire game was created for the 2021 Backtrace Game Jam\r\n<strong>Backtrace Information:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The required link to the Backtrace project instance can be found here:<br/>https://tschlompf.sp.backtrace.io/p/GameJam2021<br/>Though I am not sure if this is the link.
