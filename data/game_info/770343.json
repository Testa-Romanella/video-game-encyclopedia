In marble Knockout you can play single player or play with your friends in multiplayer. Fight to stay inside of the dome until the timer reaches zero. Pick up powerups to gain an advantage over your enemy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Marble Knockout was made in a few days for the Game Jam\u00a02022 CSGC: Digital Games Competition. Side note I didn't have enough time to fully playtest every feature the game offers before the submission deadline, so if you find any bugs please list them in the comments below and I can add updates to the game! I hope everyone enjoys this fun little project!\r\n</p>\n<p>Contributors:\u00a0turnagej19@students.ecu.edu\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T11:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c31eb3cb1d6dfc58a02015c125a83f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["sethtillery"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
