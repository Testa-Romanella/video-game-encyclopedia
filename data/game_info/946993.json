Well you came to the wrong place. Coconut Racing is the most frustrating racing game (i think) ever.</p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0inspired by GMod 9's Melon Racer.</p>\n<p>The levels are intentionally frustrating and hard. I doubt that anyone can level 8 at all, under 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>The coconut can only move forward and back with W, S and rotate with the mouse.</p>\n\n<p>WARNING!
