I uh... bit off a bit more than I could chew with this one. There is no sound, and your goal is to photograph 5 of each fish to learn their name and get their picture in a sort of log. If you encounter any bugs, feel free to let me know. To anyone that plays, thank you kindly for your time.</p><p>And many thanks to my lovely partner for drawing such wonderful fish!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Welcome, pilot, and thank you for joining the Icthyoid Belt Survey Initiative!</p>\n<p>Our goal is to document the various species living inside these unique asteroids, and we have left this quadrant of the belt in your doubtlessly capable hands.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move your ship.</p>\n<p>Press and hold F until your ship locks onto the nearest asteroid available for survey.</p>\n<p>To dock with an asteroid, press and hold Spacebar, then press Spacebar again quickly when your docking arm is lined up with the asteroid.</p>\n<p>If docked with an un-surveyable asteroid, press Spacebar again to undock.</p>\n<p>If this asteroid is available for survey, your fish probe will automatically deploy.</p>\n<p>Hold A or D to turn your probe, and alternate between those two buttons to build up speed.</p>\n<p>Press Spacebar in the probe to photograph a fish. The flash will be green if you're photographing a new specimen.</p>\n<p>Your findings are documented in the Discovered Fish menu.</p>\n<p>Once you are satisfied with your work, leave the asteroid by piloting your probe back into its starting point.</p>\n<p>For the sake of interfering with the asteroid's delicate environment as little as possible, pilots are not permitted to revisit the same asteroid environment twice.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, and thank you for your contributions!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9b4cf28922c83254f28cc04042c325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DonyPMuse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
