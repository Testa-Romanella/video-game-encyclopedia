Down key cowers can always throw down our weapons.</p>\n<p> With the space bar launch, depending on your choice, a sword, a Fireball or a Spiked Cylinder, all three have their own special move, type: the sword will launch straight in the direction that we want, the fireball instead when you Lance tends to fall down, useful to kill those monsters who are holed up in bunker where it is difficult to get in with sword and kill. The third, spiked, will have a sinusoidal, that is going up and down as he goes in the direction that we pulled, useful to hit monsters in awkward positions or impossible to reach with other weapons.</p>\n<p>With button CTRL instead we can move the screen without our hero moves, useful for seeing beyond the Visual walk and anticipate the moves of the monsters that are there. Works in all directions and you are using simply by holding down the CTRL key and then pressing a cursor key to view in any direction.</p>\n<p> You can save games and reload them later, to save or load a game, use the arrow keys:</p>\n<p> <strong>F1</strong> = Opens the menu to load a previously saved game. <br/> <strong>F2</strong>  = opens the menu to save the current game. <br/> <strong>F4</strong>  = Need to save one Screenhots (an image) in the game folder, where you have installed.                                                                                        </p>\n<p>                                            During the game you can pause by pressing the button <strong>ESC</strong> , you will see a request to quit the game or not.                                                                                            </p>\n<p> If before you click Yes, and then quit the game, then you will start the game over.</p>\n<p> If at the end of the game your score is among the best then you will be presented with the records with the chance to enter your name.</p>\n<p> The adventures are 3:</p>\n<p> <strong>Another World</strong> = Contains 2 levels.                                         </p>\n<p> <strong>Green Land</strong> = Contains 1 Level                                         </p>\n<p> <strong>UnderWorld</strong> = Contains 8 Levels                                         </p>\r\n                                                                                             Our heroThis is our hero, is the same as Ghosts'n Goblins, his movements with the cursor keys are:\u00a0\r\nLeft right, Climbs Down the stairs or if you are not on a scale then jumps or cowering.\u00a0\r\nTo do launch a weapon use SPACEBAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Weapons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <strong>Sword</strong> = The sword will launch straight in the direction we want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <strong>Fireball</strong> = Tends to fall down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <strong>Cylinder Bed Of Nails</strong> = Will have a sinusoidal, that is going up and down as he goes in the direction that we pulled.
