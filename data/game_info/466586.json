I have issues with RSI and wouldn't have been able to compete normally. Then cam the ridiculous idea to make a game on my phone, construct 3 run in the browser and there fire also works on a phone, so I had a plan.</p><p>Surprisingly it went really well. The extra restrictions made coming up with an idea easier since there was no urge to overcomplicate, and construct 3 was very pleasant to work with.</p><p>Now to tell you a little about the game. You fly through alien facilities, but you only have fuel for one dash, before you fly through the room out of control. The goal is to kill all enemies before you die.\u00a0</p><p>It works on mobile (what a surprise), or used the mouse for pcs. I hope you have fun with it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/982420c6a7e421d98b51d67c7f3ba63e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Caspercaper17"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
