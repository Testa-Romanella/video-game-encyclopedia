Now, it is mere hours before a black hole swallows the planet, which will include you if you can't escape in time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay of KELVIN consists of driving closer to the launch site (where you can escape the planet). There are 19 unique levels and multiple endings, as well as collectibles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have to manage your FUEL, SHIELD, and TEMPERATURE all while driving to the next checkpoint. If any of those run out... well, just don't let that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome levels take place outside with snowy terrain, and some levels are inside a gigantic abandoned base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe closer you get to the launch site, the closer the black hole gets. Will you escape it in time?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T04:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64bafebd2a1a6841566767a706301db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Kashani"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Fireapples"], "esrb_rating": null}
