The larger the stack without any fall, the higher your combo points. But be careful, you shouldn't leave any cube fall off the platform.</p>Controls:<ul>\n<li>Right mouse button: pick up the selectable cube;</li>\n<li>Left mouse button: drop the cube you are dragging;</li>\n<li>Use mouse to get horizontal movements;</li>\n<li>Use [w] and [s] keys for vertical moving.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tYes, I know... unfortunately it has some bugs...
