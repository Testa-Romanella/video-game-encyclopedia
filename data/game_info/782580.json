It's a platformer game in the see deeps environment. It took a lot of time because I needed to learn C#,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Unity, and pixelart drawing at the same time. Only music is from free online sources :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know the controls are rather clumsy and there are lots of details to polish. I plan to fix all of it in the future - I still like the concept - but smaller new projects give more opportunities to learn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time, hope you like to enjoy it a little. Feel free to leave some criticisms and advice in the comments :)</p>\n<p>Cheers!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T07:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7aa1453c32d6d44715fb990340e51f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PiotrPe0212"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
