Share your score with your friends, can they beat your time?</p>\n<p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Visit our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Go-Down-Stein/1552421708329862</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21fbd80f715a71d9302e81d03c7d7f89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wesoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
