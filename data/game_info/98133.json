{"id": 98133, "slug": "majo-no-drop-dead", "name": "Majo no DROP DEAD", "name_original": "Majo no DROP DEAD", "description": "<p>Match wits and black magic bubbles in this fast-paced, kawaiicore puzzle game!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Play as a creepy-cute witch and let your loyal familiar handle all the hard bubble-tossing work. Put your magical prowess to the test by dropping powerful chain reactions in single-player mode, or hex your best witch friend in two-player mode.</p>\n<p>As bubbles come down from the top of the screen, you can collect bubbles by pressing \"down\" (or \"s\"). Fire bubbles back up again using \"up\" (or \"w\") to build a vertical stack of three or more bubbles of the same color and clear those bubbles. When a vertical stack of bubbles clears, bubbles of the same color on a horizontal row will also clear. \u00a0Vertical stacks will also clear when bubbles fall after an initial clear--building chain reactions! Additionally, you can pick up multiple bubbles of the same color at a time and hold them all until you fire them up again.</p>\n\n<p>Originally made for the 2017 LowRezJam and the 2017 \"Short and Sweet\" Jam, this game was completely built in a 64 X 64 pixel format. The game currently scales up to a size of 384 X 384 pixels. The game currently also plays better in fullscreen mode. &lt;3</p><p><em>This game uses these sounds from Freesound.org:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTech Rhythmic Sound\u201d by Soughtaftersounds (https://freesound.org/people/Soughtaftersounds/)</p><p>Creative Commons; Attribution license</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMetal_Clink\u201d by blimp66 (https://freesound.org/people/blimp66/ ; http://www.davegirtsman.com/)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Creative Commons; Attribution license\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cMenu Select\u201d and \u201cMenu Move 1\u201d by killkhan (https://freesound.org/people/killkhan/)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Creative Commons; Attribution Noncommercial license\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cSpooky zone\u201d by HF2010 (Michael Carrier) (https://freesound.org/people/HF2010/)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Creative Commons; Sampling+ license\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cHigh Pitch Bubble Pop1\u201d by CGEffex (https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Creative Commons; Attribution license\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30cf5e8ce126350626ac79770ddc82b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Just Bees"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
