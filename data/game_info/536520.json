Errors and other issues will be fixed in future updates. There is also currently no art in the game but it will be added in future updates.</p>\n\n<p>High school is filled with drama and short-lived romances, how can one high school senior survive the last weeks of his high school career without at least one of these things? Honestly, how can he manage to avoid both? Unfortunately, he just can't seem to avoid either leaving him to deal with both turmoils between his friends and feelings he doesn't yet understand filling his heart. Will he make it to the end of the year? Who will he love?\u00a0Who will he hurt? It's all up to you to decide.</p>\n\n<p>Levi Kano, 18, Your best friend since the age of 8 years old he's always been a protective big brother to you. Over the years you both have grown close though you could become even closer? They often say that your partner should be your best friend, would that be the case here?</p>\n<p>Maxwell Wayne, 18, A techy nerd that has been in your friend group since the start of high school. He can switch between a complete clumsy introvert in groups but in private with you, he seems to hope up and show lots of energy. What's the reason for this? Maybe there's more that he hides behind his video games.</p>\n\n<p>Marty Quint, 18, A guy with a big heart, stomach, and a dream of becoming a chef when he gets older. He loves to cook and offers treats to anyone who asks, wanting\u00a0to put a smile on their face with his cooking. You've known him since the 7th grade and yet never bonded with him. They say the way to a man's heart is through their stomach is that true for you?</p>\n\n<p>Barron Cavol, 19, you've known him almost as long as you've known Levi but he's never truly opened up to you. He's hiding something and\u00a0likes to hide behind a tough exterior but you know he's nothing but a big teddy bear. He loves to play guitar and sing wanting to become a famous performer. Would you let him serenade you?</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Homen, 35, He has been your teacher all throughout high school and he's almost like a second father to you. He tries to be the kind of teacher you can talk to and he's always there for his students, he's gone through a lot that's not admitting what's troubling him but maybe you can make him tell you. Will you be able to get through to this teacher?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ff/0ff1c44f9d89b43b465f006534ed1be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StarFur Industries"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
