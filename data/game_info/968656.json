Mami", "description": "A classic visual novel about a workplace romance. <h3>HEROINE </h3><br/>Mami Himekawa (CV: Ryoko Teduka) <br/><br/>A slightly older coworker who\u2019s the shining star of not only the sales department but the entire company. Carries an air of confident detachment but consistently delivers outstanding results. <br/><br/>While the protagonist struggles to establish himself, Mami has already emerged as a strong contender for the next sales chief position. Unbeknownst to the main character, she has developed a fondness for him ever since he joined the company just over a year ago. Teasingly refers to him as \u201cthe kid.\u201d <br/><br/>===<br/><br/>Not long ago, I entered the corporate world, brimming with hope and ambition. After a nightmarish first twelve months, however, that all seems like a distant dream. I long for simpler times when my boss\u2019s constant put-downs didn\u2019t ruin my evening commute home. If anything, the bachelor\u2019s life I so looked forward to mirrors my own desperate state of mind, as I dig into another greasy supermarket bento in my apartment alone, next to a sink piled with dirty dishes...<br/><br/>A sweet, familiar face flashes through my mind, but I swiftly dismiss it with a shake of my head.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat is wrong with me?! She\u2019s literally my coworker...\u201d<br/><br/>Sure, there\u2019s this one girl\u2014the cute and confident Mami Himekawa. She\u2019s got the looks, the laugh, the walk, and that voice, but I highly doubt that we\u2019re compatible that way. Or am I missing something?<br/><br/>But just when I least expect it, the answer to that question reveals itself while I\u2019m at work in the office one day\u2014<br/><br/>\u201cHey there, kiddo.
