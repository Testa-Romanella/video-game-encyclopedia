It takes place in a small compound somewhere in the Siberian wilderness in the latter half of the Cold War, where the player is in charge of one of several \"numbers stations\" that broadcast codes for unknown purposes. It uses CSS, HTML, and occasional Javascript for better viewer experience and pacing, as well as recordings from real-world numbers stations.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/50411bc2071fd7f3e223eb3f7db891da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EpisodicChaos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
