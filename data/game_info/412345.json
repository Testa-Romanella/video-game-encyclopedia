In it, the player takes control of a small research ship with experimental features such as a spatial anchor, a shield module and a missile launcher, which all consume energy cells.</p>\n<p>To help conserve resources, the ship also has a gravity-altering device, which does not drain energy. With it, ships and asteroids can be displaced and destroyed, ensuring the safety of the ship.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Thrusters (Change velocity)</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Increase Asteroid Gravity</li><li>Right Mouse Button - Decrease Asteroid Gravity</li><li>Space - Launch Missile</li><li>Left Control - Spatial Anchor (Reset velocity)</li><li>Left Shift - Shield (Negate all damage for a moment)</li><li>R - Reset Game</li><li>Esc - Quit to Menu/Quit Game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df46d2d96e71f2b8d30622a0140883e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MasterProject"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
