Which is kind of how a lot of people feel right now.  </p><p>The game still needs tweaks and additions but I'd love to hear any and all feedback. </p><p>Much Love - </p><p>Neoviper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a377f1e065055bfdf605eb233084a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neoviper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
