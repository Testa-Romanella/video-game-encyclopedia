The art and mechanics aren't anywhere close to where they need to be, but I would just like to see how the concept is received. Perry is intended to be a very crude character that I think a lot of people will enjoy. The full game is also intended to have lots of voice acting and cutscenes, but you won't find any story elements in this Alpha, sadly. Let us know what you think of what we have so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd377e7721f47de38da0a9ae0bc63f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Meltdown"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
