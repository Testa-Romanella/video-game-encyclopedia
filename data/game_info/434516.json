Those birds are fragile, so feed them with magical gems on your way back to keep them alive and singing.</em>\n<p>The team strongly recommands to play the game with a headset, or at least with sound turned on, as it strongly relies on music and sound to be experienced fully. We hope you'll enjoy this experience! <br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Louis Denizet - *Game Developer*<br/>- Romain Rope - *Music &amp; Sound Design*<br/>- Mathieu Clavel - *Game Design &amp; Art*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/2046ae1a26c3282db0b718fa2326a485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Romain Rope", "Ekilibr", "Louis Denizet"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
