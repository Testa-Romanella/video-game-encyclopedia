For each level your score is defined by how many of the tiles you managed to paint before getting sliced to death. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour best score for each level adds up to your total metascore, which unlocks new fruits and difficulties. Easy and normal modes are unlocked from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditionally, in battle mode you may select one fruit and attempt to beat all the other fruits in continuous 1-to-1 face-offs.
