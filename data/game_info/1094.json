Woops!  Hook Worlds should be running fine.<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>Thanks for all the great reviews from fans and critics alike!<br/><br/>********<br/><br/>Try to survive in four different worlds with your trusty grappling hook, as four different characters with unique special abilities!  Every game world has its own all-new setting, every character has its own gameplay style.  Every world is also randomized, varied, and endless, for incredible replay value.<br/><br/>Check out our website for a gameplay trailer and reviewer quotes:  bit.ly/hookworlds<br/><br/>SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL CONTROLS:<br/><br/>There are just two buttons.  The right button controls your grappling hook, letting go detaches your hook.  The left button controls the unique special ability in each game world.  These simple controls will let you nimbly swing, dive, climb, run, slide, and shoot, rocketjump, or flip gravity!<br/><br/>FOUR GAMES IN ONE:<br/><br/>Swing your way through the Cursed Jungle as Gramps, as you try to escape the Ancient Watcher.  Shoot your way through a haunted cove as Zelle, in your pursuit of bounties and treasure.  Escape a grim future dystopia as CyberGnome 202X, using your gravity flips to evade the Gnome Cops.  Early buyers also instantly get the fourth world, a tribute to both Atari/C64 games and falling onto lethal spikes!<br/><br/>YES, THAT'S RIGHT, CYBERGNOME 202X.  AND MORE:<br/><br/>Rewards you can unlock and wear to customize your characters, visible on the scoreboards.  Medal awards and achievements for reaching high score milestones.  Blowing up haunted crabs and getting obliterated by a gigantic eye.  All of the above and more, for the permanent price of 99 cents.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f482bbd678d82b39af0cc105966b5377.jpg", "website": "http://www.rocketcat-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rocketcat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Rocketcat"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
