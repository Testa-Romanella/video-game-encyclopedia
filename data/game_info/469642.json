It has a progressive difficult curve that saves your progress and rewards you with in-game prizes. Plus, failing is an intended mechanic!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>You can play with a controller or keyboard.</p>\n<p>With a controller, move left and right\u00a0with the left analogic or d-pad and jump with A (xbox) or X (playstation).</p>\n<p>With a keyboard, move and jump with\u00a0WAD, arrow keys or 846 in a numerical keyboard, suit yourself!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game Design and programming by me</p>\n<p>Title Screen and animations by @paulo-h</p>\n<p>Tileset by @erickmarcel</p>\n<p>Sounds effects by @outspacer</p>\n<p>Music by @BitByBitBert</p>\n<p>Special thanks to @PedroVMVictor</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>\n<p>1) If you get stuck because of skulls you can go back to the initial menu and then continue. This will reset the skulls.</p><p>2) The third level, the castle, has an increased and not realistic\u00a0difficult curve. This game, together with a GDD, was the final paper to the course i was in. I had a deadline but i wanted to show more alternatives of use with the same mechanics but in different levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) I didn't have the chance to test it in Linux and Mac OSX, so if you download this versions you\u00a0might experience some bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dcde5214c8ad0bee40910c70e7e9bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Paulo H", "ErickMarcel", "equlsa"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
