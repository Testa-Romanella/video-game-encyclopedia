The planet's most mysterious nation, the isolationist Sel Tor is building a grand navy, with the seeming purpose of launching an invasion of the entire world! However, the king of the nation of Sel-Quinta has sent his herald to rally support to defeat the invasion before it starts! <br/><br/>But things haven't always been plain sailing for the Herald's team. Still reeling from the events of Sel Quinta, The Six City Quest, betrayed by one of their number, their skills and gear stolen and teleported to an un-known island, this is where you come in! Taking command of a group of six adventurers, it's up to you to travel across Sel-Mounta to rally the support of it's leadership and end the ongoing Demon invasion!<br/><br/><strong>COMBAT:</strong> The foe isn't going down without a fight and they're only growing stronger! Experience tough turn based combat featuring a large seven member party and a variety of foes, from returning foes to new horrors and the return of foes from the party's past thought long gone! The party's abilities all come with downsides too and you'll have to manage these to make it through! Combat in general has been greatly overhauled, with a new Active time with pause system as opposed to the turn based of the last game. <br/><br/><strong>NEW CLASSES:</strong> With the party's old classes stolen, they're forced to adapt to their new abilities! But they've got some real downsides compared to before...<br/><br/>Samson now acts as a healer and can provide immunities to some status's before they even take effect and keeps the party healthy without relying on mana, but without magic the effects take time to go off! You'll need to pre-empt the foe or protect injured members while the healing takes place!<br/><br/>Katalyn is now the party guardian. Her skills give her ways to attack while staying on defence, protect other party members or even control agro by taunting the foe but all that armour is heavy and you'll need to watch her low speed and lack of offence!<br/><br/>Vegal's magic is gone, but as the party's Berserker she'll still be a key source of physical damage! But to really use it to it's fullest, you'll need to make use of the Fury status effect, drastically increasing her damage and number of attacks at the expense of losing the ability to pick targets or do anything else!<br/><br/>Reilia has become a Lancer, an offensive class with incredible offence and speed! But it's a tricky class to use because of the way the skills have to be used, switching from offensive, to mobility to defensive skills, you'll need to work the cycle to your advantage as best you can!<br/><br/>Hetty's class is a total mystery even to her! It's bizarre skills focus mostly on supporting the party or depowering the foe-but most will support one thing at the expense of the other and you'll need to balance the two carefully! But with access to any gear, perhaps you can make it work...<br/><br/>Rene meanwhile has become a Chaos mage, an even more powerful variant of a Destruction mage with devastating offences but somehow even worse defences and terrible aim! Can such power be properly harnessed when in most cases you can't even choose who she'll direct her spells at?...<br/><br/><strong>STORY:</strong> Experience the ongoing story of the party's six members (and one newcomer!) as they both come to terms of what's happened before, attempt to continue their ongoing quest and encounter the ever strengthening forces of Sel-Tor! Not to mention the Demonic war sieging the island and even the intervention of the very gods themselves! <br/><br/><strong>ADVENTURE:</strong> Journey across the island of Sel Mounta with more freedom than before! Rather than being locked to just one path, this time you'll have a lot more freedom to take on your quest in the order you desire!<br/><br/><strong>BUILDS:</strong> With more, stronger foes than before, you'll need to be able to adapt your builds to match and the options are vast! Every piece of gear has it's advantages, and the array of skills at your disposal is larger than ever! From lowly daggers and swords, to powerful enchanted elemental weapons, to legendary enchanted weapons of ludicrous power! Lightning claws that strike four times in one go, Axes that petrify the foe only to smash them for additional damage, even a whole tank cannon ripped from it's former owner as only a few examples! Armour can be just as varied-how about guides that allow you to ignore normal equipment restrictions? A glass orb that grants huge evasion at the expense of near all your maximum health? Or even a hat that guarantees critical hits? Just a few of the pieces you'll encounter!<br/><br/><strong>CONVENIENCE:</strong> Things have only improved on this front too! From simple things like improved menus and autosaving, to the return of Red-Roc allowing instant teleportation to previous zones and remote access to shops without having to return to town!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T03:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2aef19df9a0d24f8a22caf07e4ba9e11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BWI Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["BWI Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
