The arcade game runs on Irem-62 Hardware, the same as Kung Fu Master.<br />\nThe differences between the Kid Niki: Radical Ninja and Kaiketsu Yancha Maru are minimal. Aside from text translation, the most glaring difference is the main character&#39;s hair style. Kid Niki&#39;s hair is more &quot;punk rock&quot; with wild spikes and a ponytail in the back. Yancha Maru&#39;s hair has more subdued spikes and a topknot (or chonmage). In the arcade version of the game, the main character&#39;s keikogi is yellow while it is red in the home ports.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-16T09:47:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d11137cae256d95ca6248b6375ceec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "NES"], "developers": ["Irem"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Data East", "IREM"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
