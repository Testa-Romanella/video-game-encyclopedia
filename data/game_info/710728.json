R again to clear map</p><p><strong>How to surf:<br/></strong>after leaving the initial platform, you will never need to press either W or D, in fact, its worse if you do.<br/>whenever you are touching a ramp, if you move towards it, you don't fall<br/>if ramp on your left, hold A (or left mouse), if ramp on your right, hold D<br/>in this game, an easy way to see this working is to hold Q and A at the same time, even better, Q and left mouse button.</p><p>Turning is a bit trickier, if you want to turn, you have to press the button in the direction of your turn, and move the mouse in the same direction. To turn right, D or RMB and move the mouse right. You can also do this while holding Q, to keep spawning ramps.</p><p>If you want to try some real surfing, I would recommend this roblox game (its basically the same experience as CS, without the need to donwload many gigabytes)<br/></p><p><strong>Credit</strong><strong>s<br/></strong>this library:<strong> https://github.com/Olezen/UnitySourceMovement<br/></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/9307d06b67e536a9fac0b0ed7ca43cbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MUT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
