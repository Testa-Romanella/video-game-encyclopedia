I've implemented some object interactions, an inventory, a HUD, character animations, and a few more things. Come check it out, and let me know what you think in the comments below.</p>\n<p>Controls support gamepads (only tested with the PS4, but should work with others) and mouse/keyboard. Press ESCAPE to reach an options menu. Hold ALT while the app loads to change screen resolution.</p>\n<p>This will be a\u00a0sequel of sorts to\u00a0a previous\u00a0game.\u00a0(An unrelated,\u00a0extremely cool, very popular game\u00a0came out with a similar name. If you haven't played it yet, you should. I'm going to re-release ANITW with a new name when I get a chance. It's an old project. It's also public domain.)</p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES<br/><em>General:</em><br/>- Only tested on OSX, with a PS4 gamepad.<br/>- No brightness setting.<br/>- No sound.</p><p><em>OSX:</em><br/>- CRT effect causes slowdown on Retina displays when played at high resolutions.<br/></p><p><em>Windows:</em><br/>- Things are a bit bright on the Windows build. Turning on the CRT effect helps.<br/>- Stamina bar on the HUD doesn't show current stamina.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/884cef6be5300c7aedb8f5a28dea9c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Patchwork Doll Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
