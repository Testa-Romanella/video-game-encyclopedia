It's a super silly and very short game! </p>Story:\r\n<p>\r\n\tGrampy Katz has a hot date and his place is a disaster! Help him clean up before his date arrives and discovers what a slob he is.\r\n</p>\r\n\tWinning/Losing:\r\n<p>\r\n\tComplete as many tasks as possible before time runs out. The ultimate goal is to have a perfect date, but a pretty good date is also nice. Don't worry, Greta is fairly opinionated and she'll tell you exactly how she feels when the date ends. Good luck!\r\n</p>\r\n\tControls:\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse the mouse to move Grampy Katz. Click on objects to quickly complete tasks before time runs out.\r\n</p>Who Made This?<br/><p>@Meowza (art, animation, programming, game design)<br/></p><p>\r\n\t@Kukubee (game design, writing)\r\n</p>Contact us: info@kukubee.com<p>Royalty-free music by: Michael Buk</p><p>\n<br/><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/795/795d07969288fadec7ab69f71eef096e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MeowzaGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
