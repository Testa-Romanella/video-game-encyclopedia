The robots come to you one-by-one on a conveyor belt and get one chance to plead their case on why you should spare them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them, they can only show you one picture at a time.\r\nWith each robot you either choose to spare or to terminate, the next robot will learn what kinds of pictures they think you like or dislike, and act accordingly. If you terminate them with no rhyme or reason - they will determine that there is no point in pleading their case, and will instead decide to simply wait for your timer to run out.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Unique AI system</strong> - Instead of you trying to figure out what their passterms are, the robots are trying to figure out what your passterms are</li><li><strong>Made (and smashed) with love </strong>- Hand-drawn artwork by Drew Montemayor\r\n</li><li><strong>Time is ticking </strong>- Race against the clock before the robots mutiny against you</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e63d5de2a03bc7ae27e59c968ccac223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akupara Jams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
