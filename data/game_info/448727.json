This project is part of RMIT university's Games Design course, which I am apart of.</p>\n<p>The premise was creating a game based around WarioWare's arcade style, fast paced gameplay, with the overarching theme of a \"non-violent\" game. It consists of 3 main micro-sized games played in quick succession with increasing difficulty.<br/><br/>This is a small piece of a larger scheme project named \"Tiny Beats,\" which me and my fellow RMIT Games Design course students are developing, soon to be released in Itch.io.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music acknowledgments:</p>\n<p>Composer: Josh Hickman (insta: @joshhickmanmusic) and Ionat\u00e1n Biniamin Maghidman<br/>Producer: Lucas de la Rosa (lucasmigueldelarosa@gmail.com)</p>\n\n<p>Miscellaneous Sounds Acknowledgment:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/Stickinthemud/sounds/27882/ | Original author: Stickinthemud | File modification: No editing was done to it. | Copyright liscense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/Terhen/sounds/234185/\u00a0 | Original author: Terhen | File modification: The audio was accelerated and cut shorter. | Copyright liscense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/ShawnyBoy/sounds/166191/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/Wagna/sounds/326133/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/keweldog/sounds/181718/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/hareball101/sounds/326756/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/398271/ | Original author: InspectorJ | File modification: The audio was cut shorter. | Copyright liscense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/Grubzyy/sounds/422723/ Original link: https://freesound.org/people/cetsoundcrew/sounds/397662/ | Original author: cetsoundcrew | File modification: The audio was accelerated and cut shorter. | Copyright liscense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>Original link: https://freesound.org/people/raremess/sounds/222558/</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25d25e4715b1206cb265d262287e5a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ionatan B Maghidman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
