Not having a plan meant that I didn't get as far as I could have. There is only one enemy, no boss, and no real story at all. I wanted to add in a shop where you could buy more stamina, heal, etc, but didn't have time. It's still pretty solid beside that.</p>\n<p>I haven't decided if I'll continue this past where it stands at the moment. Maybe to get the initial vision I have in my head right now, but meh, we'll see.
