The players have to deliver cargo using the post-Soviet machinery deep in the Russian woods, where there are no solid roads and a lot of fallen trees.</p>\n<p>The main feature of the game is dynamic terrain. That is achieved with Havok physics engine. Trucks leave marks on the road, get stuck in the terrain, which makes the further advancement harder.  Thanks to Havok, the terrain is procedurally generated every time the player loads a map. That adds a high replayability value to the game. This feature also makes the races against other players much harder, as you can&#39;t just win a race by going as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>In SPINTIRES, the game focuses a lot on simulating the physics and behavior of the vehicles. Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car.</p>\n<p>The players can also modify the cars using different attachments. It is possible to attach fuel tanks, repair kits, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game features a 4-player multiplayer mode, where the players can choose the time of day, and the environment. The objective of the mode is to reach the finish first without getting stuck in the mud.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2014-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6bd/6bd2862420402fa45d690295ed308cc6.jpg", "website": "http://www.spintires.com", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 1223, "beaten": 62, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 99, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 79, "ratings_count": 197, "suggestions_count": 562, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 198, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oovee\u00ae Game Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": ["IMGN.PRO", "Oovee\u00ae Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
