There are 96 riders and over 120 staff personnel to potentially sign to try to improve your teams performance.</p>\n<p>Take your riders through pre-season testing into the new racing season. Instruct them on their machines setup and qualifying and race expectations. Choose their race tyres, and hope they perform in the race as you asked them too.</p>\n<p>Terminate rider contracts early if you feel your current riders are not getting the results you would like, and sign a replacement rider.</p>\n<p>Endless event driven gameplay, and dynamic season play, ensure no two games will play out the same way. In fact, re-running races will often produce different results due to the dynamic\u00a0 method used to calculate rider/machine performance during races.</p>\n<p>Races can be viewed from an overhead perspective or quick finished to the race results.</p>\n<p>Pre-season and mid-season test sessions are part of the racing calendar. Riders can also suffer an injury during training, testing or racing.</p>\n<p>Retiring riders automatically regenerate to a young rider to start their career again, however there is no guarantee that they will be as successful or follow the same career path as their previous riders history.</p>\n\n<p>This is the only offline simulation of running a Motogp team.</p>\n<p>This has been a labour of love making this game. I always wanted to play a game where I could manage a team in Motogp and couldn't find any decent offline games. So I made the decision to make my own game and then share it with other fans of the sport and sport management sims in general. I really hope you enjoy the game if you download it, I enjoy it and to me that shows that it is what I wanted.</p>\n<p>Donations are very much appreciated to enable me to work on this and other projects - if you enjoy MGP Manager, why not buy me a cup of coffee for $3.99..............</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/765bf040c0a26fc34f0afad2586915f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mgpmanager"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
