He studied paintings in Moscow and was affiliated with the Russian \"Cubo-Futurism\" movement in 1912. His art evolved through his life in constant research of new visual forms which\u00a0had a profound influence on the development of 20th-century avant-gardes and\u00a0abstract art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His theories and paintings on a \"non-objective\" idea of artistic creation where the objective world is meaningless and where \"the significant thing is feeling\" are key in the birth of the new era of Art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 1915, he displayed new forms of\u00a0paintings at the <strong>\"Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0,10\"</strong>\u00a0in Saint Petersburg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This now historic exhibition was important to display a\u00a0 form of non-objective art called Suprematism, introducing a daring visual vernacular composed of geometric forms of varying color, and signifying the end of Russia's previous leading art movement, Cubo-Futurism, hence the exhibition's full name. The sort of geometric abstraction relating to Suprematism was distinct in the apparent kinetic motion and angular shapes of its elements.</p>\n<p><em>Photograph of the exhibition (left), Black Square (middle), Suprematist Composition (right)</em><br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p><em>\"This is a new plastic realism, plastic precisely because the realism of hills, sky, and water is missing.
