Either the food he ate has somehow transported him to an alternative dimension or he's hallucinating. Whatever's happened, he knows only that he needs to escape this bizarro place. And there's just one way out: down the toilet (like that bit out of Trainspotting)! Luckily, Walter has a number of tricks up his sleeve, all of which he'll have to make use of if he wants to get back home in time to feed his cat and find out how Game of Thrones ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b35579f9b13c229da1581b4e365a308e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Parallel Realities"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
