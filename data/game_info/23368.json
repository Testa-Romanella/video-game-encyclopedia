You have to consider group compositon and weapon distribution as each environment have different enemies which require different approach. Are you going to face enemies with strong armor? You are going to need flamers as they ignore enemy armor. Are you heading straight in to Riders teritory who are know to use a lot of bikers with high dodge chance? You better bring tesla weapon or two as they ignore enemy dodge. Are you going to run Patrol mission? You will probably need to rearm completely as you ll need to free up space in your main vehicle for extra consumables like vehicle spare parts, extra fuel to intercept bonus objectives or supply of purified water to refresh your warriors during mission.<br/><br/>All your vehicles gain experience and gets stronger with each mission they survive, if you lose your vehicle, its lost forever along with its equipment. But dont worry replacement is allready waiting in vehicle workshop if you can afford it. Lacking screws? You can hire one or two wasteland heroes for a day and run easy missions till you will be able to rebuild your favourite squad again.<br/><br/>Your main vehicle is the pumping heart of your squadron. In the begining its just a little more than armored brick but with each upgrade, you can shape to suit your needs. Do you want it to fill support role? No problem, equip it with additional ammo boxes for more carrying capacity, add spikes and giant buzzsaw crane to boost damage of all your vehicles. Attack role? Fit machine guns, explosive spearthrowers and dreaded missile launcher. Want it to tank for your your party? No problem, we ve got armor plates too!;-)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b59c2be2dc67e6b1dcbdb67df9840d8.jpg", "website": "http://www.indiedb.com/games/blasted-road-terror", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 25, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 59, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tryzna83"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Tryzna83"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
