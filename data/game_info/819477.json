The text at the corner of the screen explains how scoring works. You have to click on one of your dice before you roll it, you can also pass your turn.<br/></p>\n<p>To make the game as accessible as possible I didn't implement any life system or save system. You have access to all the content and narrative right at the start. <br/><br/>That said I do recommend playing and reading from top to bottom left to right. I also recommend playing slowly and thoughtfully trying to lose as few games as possible.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Character Art and Logo: A Hill</p>\n<p>UI, Programming, Writing, Music: M Vera</p>\r\nCommon Issues\r\n<p>If the game is too small or big for your browser window use Ctrl+ or Ctrl- to zoom in or out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/603/6032efeba729dfa0010d8ddfea8a82f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matteo Vera"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
