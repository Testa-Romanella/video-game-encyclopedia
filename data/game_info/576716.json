I abandoned the project to devote myself to other projects and five years later I decided to do some updates, making it more easy and more friendly user (but I not rebuild all game) in order to be able to share it on itch! <br/>I hope some of you will have fun and do not hesitate to give me your opinion. <br/>The game is in French and English and although it is compatible with mobiles I recommend to play on tablet, phone are probably too small. See you soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd603fd43513745b09547e3e478da11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mohat"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
