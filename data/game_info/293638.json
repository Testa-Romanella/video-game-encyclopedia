C# was used for the entirety of the scripting for the project and coded by myself. The scripting included movement, gravity/mass scaling, health, point collecting, animation, and camera follow to tie the game together smoothly. All art was created by my partner Soojin Park except for the Bee and Wasp which were pulled from online.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25ca8e52cf7e06a75ae84d69b8bd1136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peyton Breech"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
