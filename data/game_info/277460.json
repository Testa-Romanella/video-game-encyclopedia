You play as a paddle trying to dodge the attacks of Schmitty Doop! As you dodge attacks you get power ups to fight back! I guess that makes it\u00a0more of an anti-pong since you're dodging bullets...</p>\n<p>I've noticed there are two small performance hickups on Chrome the first time you dodge a ball, and the first time you die due to how I allocate frequently used object. When running on Firefox I don't see these hickups.</p>\n<p>I am a professional software developer that made this game\u00a0nights and weekends for the last several months. Play for free, but if you buy you will get all the source code \u00a0fully documented. Web documentation can be found at toasterfuel.com</p>\n<p>This game was developed live on Twitch!
