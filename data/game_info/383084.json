The\u00a0<em>Eyeship</em>\u00a0has a rotating shield that the player controls to vaporize incoming asteroids and\u00a0protect the ship.\u00a0Along with asteroids, the ship also encounters power-ups and balls of pure energy called anti-asteroids throughout its journey. Asteroids will damage the ship if they collide with it, anti-asteroids will damage the ship if they collide with the shield, and power-ups give the player helpful abilities when they collide with the ship. The player\u2019s goal in the game is to keep the ship safe for as long as possible. The player increases their score overtime and will lose the game if they take four hits of damage.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this game is for it to be accessible and enjoyed by people with differing visual impairments, such as macular degeneration, colorblindness, etc. This is done by changing visual aspects of the game, without modifying the core gameplay.\u00a0Individual accessibility through player adjustment was key for the development, and the project team ensured that\u00a0both the coding and graphics of the game allow for this.</p>\n\n<p>The game was created by a team of four students at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, as the main course project for Gaming for the Greater Good(ENGR 100 - 650), a core engineering course that tasked students with the creation of a game that was accessible to player's with visual impairments.</p>\n\n<p>The team:</p>\n<p>Akash Agrawal Bejarano (akashab@umich.edu)</p>\n<p>Ching Hang Benny Chan (four@umich.edu)</p>\n<p>Aaron Leiss (leiaar@umich.edu</p>\n<p>Juan Rivera Plata (jjrp@umich.edu)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e593b182e68f70a5c9f27d58ccac6a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eyesteroids Team"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
