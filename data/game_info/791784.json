It was said that the catacombs are full of unknown surface creatures that no one has ever seen. Some were friendly, others wanted destruction. Peaceful creatures constantly had to hide from the destroyers in order to avoid unreasonable anger. But one day everything changed. Waste, constantly dripping from the ceilings of the catacombs, formed a small creature - a clot of viscous bluish mucus. And now the fate of the catacombs depends only on this creature! Go through a huge number of caves, solve many puzzles, and fight against the strongest enemies!<br/><br/><strong>features:</strong><br/><ul><li>music by Lenstroy<br/></li><li>graphic by PixelGO<br/></li><li>over 30 levels</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T08:05:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a27a0738944cb9ad429764b3f6bef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkNEU"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["galesoozka"], "esrb_rating": null}
