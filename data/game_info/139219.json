Only this maze is has a mind of its own, it shifts and bends when the player least expects it. Labyrinth is more or less designed to reveal how we as humans deal with virtual space. This idea is primarily manifested in the mesh deformations, which will hopefully allow us to subvert the players expectations of the layout of the maze. This project relies heavily on graphics programming and procedural generation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde8d16f610b1b47d64cab5dd16472bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GlowLime Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
