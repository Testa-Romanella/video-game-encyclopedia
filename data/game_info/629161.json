This unit involved us working in, and contributing to, a simulated game development studio. Initially, students were allocated slots to pitch their game ideas if they wished to do so. Untitled furniture builder was my pitch, and it was selected for development alongside 3 others, which made me the project leader for UFB.</p>\n<p>The aim of each level is to successfully build the required piece of furniture, and the time you take to do so will affect your score which will be revealed upon completion. Your scores and ratings are saved, so levels can be replayed to get the best score possible. The environment can be explored, and objects can be picked up and thrown around.\r\n</p>\n<p>Download it and see if you can complete all of the levels!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec0b3c663105d20c6081ec385aa137b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
