And gosh darn it, that\u2019s a whole lotta chores! She just plain refuses to hire an extra pair of hands, as she expects her daughter will be returning anytime soon. To top it all off, somehow she hasn't slept since it all began. Talk about a rough patch, huh, partner? But it seems she found just the cure for her insomnia. It just seems a bit far-fetched, If you ask me...</p>\n\n<p>Play as Margaret as she tries to remember the correct <em>whistle notes</em> to guide Lassie, the dog, around the pasture. Use Lassie to herd the sheep from one area to the next, until Margaret is satisfied!</p>\n\n<p>The herding controls are very simple: the only buttons you need to use are <strong>Q</strong> and <strong>W</strong>, and both are for whistling. The secret lies in the combinations \u2014 but only Margaret's daughter knew them!</p>\n<p>Figure out the melodies, and soon you'll be as skilled as a bonafide shepherd. If only whistling would work on people, too...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T06:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/592869918098c2349a4113cceb35913f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thadeu Alonso", "LucasPereiraGD", "biosuco", "LeoBorges", "Light, Castle & Pear Games", "ArLucas17", "Renato Baroni", "bherdy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
