{"id": 52476, "slug": "warlords-1980", "name": "Warlords (1980)", "name_original": "Warlords (1980)", "description": "<p>Warlords is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1980. The game resembles a combination of Breakout and Quadrapong (an early Atari arcade game) in the sense that not only can up to 4 players play the game at the same time, but also the &quot;castles&quot; in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that could be broken with a flaming ball.<br />\nWarlords uses spinner controllers for player control, and came in both an upright 2 player version and a 4 player cocktail version. The upright version uses a black and white monitor, and reflects the game image onto a mirror, with a backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only supports up to two simultaneous players, which move through the levels as a team. The cocktail version is in color, and supports 1-4 players. 3-4 player games are free-for-all&#39;s where the game ends as soon as one player wins. 1-2 player games play identical to the upright version.<br />\nAccording to the Atari video game production numbers, 1014 uprights were made, and 1253 cocktails were produced. The prototype version of Warlords was called &quot;Castles and Kings&quot; and was housed in a 4 player &quot;Sprint 4 like&quot; cabinet - it was huge. Only 2 versions of the prototype were made. The game was considered a success, although the large cabinet made it impossible to produce in large quantities nor was it feasible to install - hence the smaller cocktail design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1980-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-11T14:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cdae12ab63fa62ef374afd0dba10739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 13, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "Game Boy Advance", "Atari 2600", "Xbox 360", "PC", "Atari Flashback"], "developers": ["Atari", "Krome Studios", "Krome"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Atari", "Microsoft Game Studios", "Sears"], "esrb_rating": null}
