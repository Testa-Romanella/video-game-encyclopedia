Itch.io is weird.<br/></p>\n<p>Here at Dram Co, we care deeply about the environment. That is why we\r\n continue to sell oil! The trees want CO2, and we are happy to provide \r\nit. We are also incredibly happy to make billions of dollars. <br/></p>\n<p>Now, the thing is, we need people like you to help us make money. \r\nEveryone that worked at SeaBear left due to \"working conditions\" and \r\n\"fair pay\" (buzzwords that don't really matter*), but that doesn't \r\nmatter, because we where already replacing them with robots. However, \r\ndue to big government, our oil rigs need a dedicated operator. That is \r\nwhere you come in.<br/></p>\n<p>Quick guide for those that are lost (leave a comment on why you got lost, I am new to game development and would like feedback):</p>\n<ol><li>Type \"help\" to get the list of commands</li><li>Read your messages</li><li>Huh.
