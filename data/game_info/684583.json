However, this time you are the angry ghost girl.</p>\n<p><em>Tell </em>is a shot jam game made in roughly 16 hours trying to capture the feeling of being a ringu-esque ghost with a match-3 gameplay because I refuse to make an idle game.</p>\n<ul><li>The symbols are group of people. Click on them to curse them, then click again to lead them to other groups.</li><li>Groups die after a few seconds of being lead. Each kill gives you 10 points but costs some energy.</li><li>Moving groups will drag groups with the same symbol along. Match 3 or more to score 1000 points and recover energy for each symbol.</li></ul>\n<p>Liked this short mess?
