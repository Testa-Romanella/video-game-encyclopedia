It was inspired by a short passage in Orson Scott Card\u2019s book  <em>Ender\u2019s Game</em> that described Ender\u2019s experience watching a game being played as a 3-dimensional hologram. It's one of my older games, developed from September through December 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Play: </strong>You perpetually move forward, building tunnels into a procedurally generated voxel asteroid. Enemies will follow you through the tunnels you create. You lay traps and build confusing pathways to stop them and continue to survive. But be careful! Leaving the asteroid is dangerous!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to turn</li><li>Q/E to rotate camera</li><li>Scrollwheel to zoom camera</li><li>1-3 to place traps</li><li>Space to shoot enemies in front of you</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T03:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d717fc79fcc9ee6121395d7c5f6bbbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kangasaur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
