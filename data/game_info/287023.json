The idea came from the main mechanics, a ghost that traces our past path, had to make a 3d game on unity. From there we decided on a digital/neon universe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The project had a second development period over three weeks and this time the group had 11 people, have then decided to review the gameplay of the game so that it is more faithful to what one had promised, it is then that we have reviewed the code of the game and the mechanic of the phantom. The artistic direction was reworked as whole, it\u2019s the same for the Level Design which was mostly rebalanced. After that a trailer to view the day and the project came to an end.</p>\n<p>Teams :<br/></p>\n<p>- Game Design : Onesti Enzo / Crespel Alexandre / Broussaud Gaspard / Leroux Ludovic</p>\n<p>- Level Design : Leroux Ludovic / Crespel Alexandre</p>\n<p>- Programming : Broussaud Gaspard / Onesti Enzo /\u00a0Guillemot Antoine</p>\n<p>- 3D : Babef Yann / Messinese Bastien / Guillemot Antoine</p>\n<p>- 2D : Toussaint Clara</p>\n<p>- Sound Design : Cecchi Thierry</p>\n<p>- Trailer/Logo\u00a0\u00a0:\u00a0 Forgue Arnaud / Cecchi Thierry</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858179c390f129642296490bfd787ed3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EnzoOnesti"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
