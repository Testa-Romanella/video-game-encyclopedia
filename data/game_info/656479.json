Well this game is not for them. Welcome to <strong>Chaos Slugger </strong>where as you kill enemies it charges a meter that chooses a random event to destroy your chances of survival. Heavily inspired by the Wild Magic Sorcerer in <strong>D&amp;D</strong> where when you roll for wild magic it has a chance to keep rolling essentially ending with whatever chaos your luck decided. This game is also inspired by an old flash game I\u00a0remember playing I believe it was called \"<strong>Zombie Homerun</strong>\" but don't quote me on that.</p>\n<p>Also please feel free to leave feedback in the comments and post your scores if you want! This is my second ever game jam so I love to see what people have to say so I can improve.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>The time I was trying to add a new mechanic and it completely broke the roll chaos event mechanic and crashed unity 2021 colorized.</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Tutorial</em><br/></p>\n\r\nTheme Interpretation:\u00a0\r\n<p>\"<strong>Let There Be Chaos!</strong>\" was the theme for the <strong>Brackey's Game Jam 2021.2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>When I think of chaos I think random-ness, when I hear random I think <strong>D&amp;D</strong> a game that entirely bases your survival, successes and failures off how lucky you are. So I immediately thought random events was the way to go, but I\u00a0didn't want it to be as simple as that so I was trying to think of a way to mix a tons of random things to make a game and I wrote down a list of random creatures to try and think of ideas:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Goblins\r\n</li><li>Robots\r\n</li><li>Dinosaurs\r\n</li><li>Wizards\r\n</li><li>Knights\r\n</li><li>Trolls\r\n</li><li>Astronauts\r\n</li><li>Skeletons\r\n</li><li>Evil Overlord\r\n</li><li>Ogre\r\n</li><li>Fire\r\n</li><li>Unicorns\r\n</li><li>Zombies\r\n</li><li>Cyborg\r\n</li><li>Spider\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>and I used a random number picker to try and find some that would be interesting if combined into the same setting but I couldn't really think of much but for whatever reason my brain remembered an old flash game about playing as a baseball player and hitting zombies into each other with a bat and they would bounce around the stage to damage one another.\u00a0 So then I got thinking and came up with that general idea but with a random event system on top of it. I don't know why but the idea of a robot batter was entertaining to me so I made him the main character, and I was going to add that entire list as enemies but honestly I didn't want to get too complex as it is only a week long jam and didn't wanna add more than I had the time for.\u00a0 Anyway I added a baseball to the scene and was like it would so cool to hit that around the scene to kill enemies so that's what I\u00a0ended up adding , after that I added enemies, then random events then boom the game was done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In short, <strong>Random Events</strong> + <strong>Random Enemy Ideas</strong>\u00a0= <strong>Chaos</strong></p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>The only song in the game is by\u00a0<strong>Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio </strong>the song itself is called \"<strong>Plague Rat</strong>\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seriously I am no composer and I am infinitely thankful for someone making royalty free music for everyone to use in their projects, seriously go check out his channel all the songs are bangers.</p>\r\nBonus:\r\n<p>I made some cool renders of the characters:</p>\n\n<p><em>The Player</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>The Wizard</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>The Parasite</em></p>\r\nTips &amp; Tricks:\r\n<p>Since I made the game I know a every mechanic kind of well so if you want some cool tips about the game that may or may not help you keep reading if not you may stop here I put this last on purpose in case you wanna figure these things out for yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>SPOILERS:</em></strong></p>\n<p>- The main characters chest is a collider so the baseball can bounce off of it in case you couldn't hit it with a bat however it wont go as fast doing this and is weird to aim so just hit it with the bat but maybe helpful info.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0When enemies collide with one another they each take damage use this to your advantage.</p>\n<p>- You can hit the ball with the bat. (well no sh-)</p>\n<p>- Keep a close eye on how fast each enemy goes and their health, knowing priority of which enemy to take care of is life or death.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:55:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f21ced713a2ae3c4c66b5760f1e14f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BigPapaOcnarf123"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
