Only when talking about other flutes do we specify the type of flute (ex: transverse flute). This felt easier to understand for some non-english languages. In addition, \"Recorder Master\" was taken. ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363454b637ea51c7c4a5af904cdb2255.jpg", "website": "http://insigniolabs.com/flutemaster", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Insignio Labs"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Insignio Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
