The gamified experience will guide the user to complete writing tasks scattered throughout the story. In this experience, the narrative will be a retelling of the folktale \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" a famous Middle Eastern folktale. The user will have fun memorizing how to write letters and words to progress through the story and help Ali Baba and his friends escape the dangers. Making it a gamified experience, and adding in Ali Baba's journey, will not only keep the user engaged but also teach them about Arabic culture. Since Alefwabaa is tackling the topic of learning a language, it's easier to learn a language if the user is interested in the culture, or music, or food. So adding these elements into the game will make it easier for the user to make a connection to those elements and give them an introduction to the Arabic language (and hopefully motivate them to continue their studies outside of the game).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T04:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d64dc88da294fb8e0d89a941e70fd2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoseEmber"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
