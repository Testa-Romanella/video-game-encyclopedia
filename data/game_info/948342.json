During the game the player switches sides on occasion. Meanwhile, the world around the player goes up in flames. The underlying message of the game is that there is not enough time for lengthy discussions or debates. Instead, quick action is needed to address the problem. The burning world serves as a metaphor for the urgency of the situation and the need for a call to action. The game should make it clear that the alternative is a decent conversation as opposed to a heated argument.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Aim at target with the mouse.<br/>Click the left mouse button to throw a paper wad at your target.<br/>Use A and D or Left Arrow and Right Arrow to dodge incoming paper wads.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T08:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0dbb2c0e0e6121d06059aa3fb88dfaf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarcNeeleman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
