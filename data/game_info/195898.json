It comes as a rar file so make sure you have an extraction tool such as WinRar or 7Zip. </p><p>This game features an interesting core mechanic where you have 2 modes for the character to be in a pogo like mode and a scooter like mode. You move fast and jump not so high in one, where the opposite is true in the other mode.</p><p>Please feel free to use any assets from this project as they are all created by me and copyright free. Also if you could take time to give me feedback that would be very much appreciated. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c37/c37c371293cd54a3df621511b3b23214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Wildish"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
