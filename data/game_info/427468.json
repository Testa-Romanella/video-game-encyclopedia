Compete head-to-head against other players as you move your armada, defend your homeland, and partake in strategic tactical battles. Master your strategy by researching new cards, scouting your enemies, and outwitting your opponents.<br/><br/><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>When you play cards on the galaxy map, they transform into 3D models of ships or structures that you can move around from planet to planet. Turns happen simultaneously, so you will need to anticipate, bluff, and out-think your opponent during each turn if you want to win. Your strategy relies on the deck you build and your choice of technology options selected before you play. During the game, you can modify your strategy by adding powerful, new cards to your deck from your tech-pool.  Explore worlds, colonize sectors, and gain resources to expand your galactic empire and conquer your enemies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T05:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/74468e055ce71790cb0689710d6fab53.jpg", "website": "https://galacollider.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NeoCrux"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeoCrux"], "esrb_rating": null}
