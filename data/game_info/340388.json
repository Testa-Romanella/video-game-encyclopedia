But the further you explore, the more you realize there is more to this disaster...and creatures lurking in the shadows follow your every move. Navigate your way through treacherous puzzles that use light in different ways to solve them. Uncover the mystery behind the Avatar of Darkness and his vicious Shadowspawn and escape before the shadows close in around you!<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Bring to Light</em>\u00a0supports both VR and Non-VR. Experience an immersive Virtual Reality experience with\u00a0<em>Bring to Light</em>\u00a0on Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, perfect as a seated or standing experience. Or turn your lights out and lean into your monitor to play with mouse &amp; keyboard or a controller!<br/></p>\n<p>If you buy the game on itch.io the download is for the non-VR version, but you get a\u00a0<strong>Steam Key</strong> that will include the VR version with Steam VR and Oculus support.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bring to Light</em>\u00a0can use bio-metric (heart rate) data to change your experience in real time. Combined with our special AI, we are able to increase or decrease the intensity and scare factors in the game based on your heart rate. If you have a supported heart rate device, the game will know when you\u2019re not scared enough- and scare you more!<br/><br/>If you do not have a device, don\u2019t worry. We will be influencing the events based on the heart rates of others who do and you will be sharing in the most frightening, scariest game with them!</p>\n\n<p>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</p>\n<ul>MINIMUM:<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 7 - 64bit</li><li>Processor:\u00a02+ Cores, e.g. Intel Core i3</li><li>Memory:\u00a04 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Dedicated 1 GB+ VRAM</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 11</li><li>Storage:\u00a06 GB available space</li></ul></ul>\n<ul>RECOMMENDED:<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 10 - 64bit</li><li>Processor:\u00a04+ Cores, e.g. Intel Core i7</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Dedicated 2 GB+ VRAM</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 11</li><li>Storage:\u00a012 GB available space</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d54c74d55f318a6d55bdef9bc93d6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Meat Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
