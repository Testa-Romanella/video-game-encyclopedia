Be careful and watch out for birds and cacti as they take some of your water when you hit them. You can protect yourself with a shield and rehydrate by picking up water bottles. As the game goes on it gets faster and faster, fortunately if you can catch the stopwatches you can slow things back down again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-21T18:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7c9f3fde4d6ebf9081c4fb789e1e61b.jpg", "website": "http://destinsdestiny.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["1026 Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Jeremy Curcio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
