In addition the app does all the math behind the points for you and where they go.<br/><br/>When the app first starts, it is an empty sheet. By pressing the \"Add Score\" button you can add the score for one played hand. Choose the side that played, the suit and tricks bid, and how many tricks where made. Also make sure to set whether it was a double bid and if the playing side gets any points for Honors (having four of the top five trump cards, for example). By pressing \"Add Score\" again the app displays the points accordingly. <br/><br/>With the \"Undo\" button the last entered hand can be removed. <br/><br/>Long press on the \"We\" or \"They\" gives you the ability to change the names of the teams. This will also be changed in the \"Add Score\" screen. <br/><br/>\"Reset Game\" deletes the current rubber and gives you a new blank page. Until then, the app saves the current rubber.<br/><br/>This app was Stephi Goering's first app ever!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T16:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07b/07beaaf1b264fdfd63c24a20ef272d49_V04tR8u.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["John Goering"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["John Goering"], "esrb_rating": null}
