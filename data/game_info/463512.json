Acid tiles will be replaced with a special dirt solution, and this dirt will spread to nearby tiles of the same type of acid. Dirt tiles near acid tiles will eventually break down though. Stay out of the acid for as long as possible!<br/><br/>BUG: Restarting won't actually let you\u00a0restart properly, oops! Realized too late. You'll just have to refresh the page.<br/><br/>My final submission for Triple Trijam! I made this game in 9 hours, and published less complete games after just 3 and 6 hours of development time. You can find those here:</p>\n<p>3 Hours<br/></p>\n<p>6 Hours</p>\n<p>I am planning on making a video describing my development process and other thoughts, when that's finished I'll post a link here.</p>\n<p>My original concept came out of trying to fit all three themes together. Chain Reactions and Negative Feedback Loops both reminded me of how populations function. In a predator-prey population, a sudden surge in prey leads to a sudden surge in predators, but simultaneously that then cycles back and limits the sizes of both populations. Starting from there, I\u00a0quickly realized this sort of gameplay dynamic felt a lot like match-3 games like Bejewled. So since I also wanted to put a twist on a classic game for the third theme, I leaned into that. I tried a lot of different ideas out in the first two builds, experimented with realtime versus turnbased, various methods of destroying and replacing tiles, and eventually ended up here, in this survival mode game where you can only walk on certain tiles, and try to stay alive for as long as possible. I'm not sure what I've made is that compelling or fun, but I'm happy with the results given the time limit and the number of different ideas I had to put together to make this work.<br/><br/>I didn't have ANY time for any sort of narrative, but I assume you're a wizard or alchemist who fell asleep in your jamjams and suddenly has to try to survive a bunch of different acids destroying the ground underneath you. Not sure how good a fit that is for the gameplay but oh well :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0used the following Diversifiers:</p>\n<p>Upcoming Postmortem Video<br/></p>\n<p>Main Menu</p>\n<p>WASD/IJKL/QZSD/Arrow Key compatibility</p>\n<p>Color Blind tested using the link on the jam site (made sure the tiles were fairly distinguishable, and gave them different patterns in case)</p>\n<p>Violence is not the answer</p>\n<p>Working on editing the theme of this page now :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b72e801c962b729dec646cd278ac1718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AnsonRutherford"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
