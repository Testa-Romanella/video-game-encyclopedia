Conditions are perfect, you've calculated and researched and now have the magic phrase to utter to summon forth a spirit from the nether realm.</p><p><strong>SUDDENLY YOUR FUCKING CAT SHOWS UP, YELPS AS THE SPIRIT BEGINS TO APPEAR! AND SENDS IT INTO A FLURRY!</strong></p><p>You must salvage this bad situation and utter a new magic phrase/ complete an improvised ritual in order to quell the spirit.</p><p>Dat mechanic: Anagrams on crack!</p><p>So The player is given a phrase. For example, one of those bullshit motivational quotes</p><p>\" Every journey starts with a small step\u2026\"</p><p><strong>The fucking cat shows ups !</strong></p><p>and the player is now given a broken version of this phras</p><p>\"Ever journey y start s \u2026 small a step\"</p><p>The player then has a limited amount of time to re organize the phrase into something grammatically correct!
