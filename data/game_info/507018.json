Nature", "description": "<p>The world has been deforested beyond the point of crysis. Most, if not all, people are dead from asphyxia caused by the lack of oxygen. However, M.O.T.H.E.R. was created to rebuild life on Earth. The Mechanical Orientation Technology for Helping the Eart Revive cultivates new humans who, in turn, cultivate life back into the Earth. One last attempt to establish The Cycle of Life.</p>\n<p>Objective: Rebuild Life on Earth with help of your MOTHER.</p>\n<p>Die to fertilize the earth and interact with fertilized land to plant.</p>\n<p>Select the type of plant you want in the bunker.</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>E to Interact</p>\n<p>SPACE to jump</p>\n<p>SHIFT to run</p>\n\n<p>This is a first playable iteration of the game. We would like your opinion on which of the following functionalities you would like to see:</p>\n<p>- We already planned to add a different sound to each plant in this iteration, but had technical problems. We also have a song that exemplifies the training MOTHER gives the kids. The song connects with the sounds the plants make. This is so you can toy with the the plants, creating sound combinations in addition to the visual combinations.</p>\n<p>- The ability to cultivate more humans that take care of the garden, along with a combination of controls from a birds eye perspective and the third person view.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Survival mechanics: This combines well with the previous mechanic.\u00a0Your humans require food, and you require them to take care of the plants. This adds another caring mechanic that promotes the theme. It also adds management and strategy challenges.<br/></p>\n<p>- Interactions between the different plants and bugs that attack them. Lavender promotes growth, Mint repels insects, Marygold attracts bugs that eat other bugs, Money Bonsai purifies the air, Tomatoes are your food and the Orange Nasturtium gets eaten instead of your plants. This could add more management and strategy challenges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- A drone so you can see the shapes you are creating from above, a better view to toy with.</p>\n<p>- A bigger map in which you can explore a town and learn about the story. This adds an exploration and story side to the game, so you can get more immesed with the story and venture into this world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8b/f8b301b164e2c387adc1a9e509c68a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HyperGnosys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
