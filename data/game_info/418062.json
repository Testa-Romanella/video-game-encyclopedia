From the start I had two goals:</p>\n<p>1) Make a roguelike</p>\n<p>2) Use only emoji for the graphics.</p>\n<p>While reflecting on what I enjoy the most about roguelikes and rogue-lites, I wanted to see if I could create enough interlocking systems to create interesting emergent gameplay. While I didn't get around to everything I wanted, like armor pickups and extending the enchantment mechanics to enemies (e.g. a Fire Bear), I'm pretty happy with what I was able to put together as a \"complete\" game.</p>\n<p>The great thing about using emoji for graphics is that it provides instant inspiration for additional weapons, enchantments, enemies, gameplay systems... my hope is to work on a follow-up that can incorporate more of these elements, and look forward to any feedback of things players would be interested in seeing.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>- Aaron Z.
