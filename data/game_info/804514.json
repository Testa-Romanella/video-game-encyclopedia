This civilization believe in one God, called Ecko. They pretend that he is the creator of all and the only man to understand another civilization leaving on this planet : the Machine civilization. Also, they believe that one day, a Listio child will be blessed by Ecko and will be able to use the Machine people to recreate a perfect world. They call this power : \"The Resonance Power\". However, they think that this child needs to be perfect, without any diseases or disabilities. So they started to kidnap any child suffering from a disability and\u00a0enclosed them in a brand new cage, called \"The Evolutive Jail\". This prison is unique because she's guarded by a Machine, called \"The Steel Gorgonne\", and its walls are constantly moving, preventing anyone who try to escape from it to plan his evasion.</p>\n<p>Your name is Xero, and you suffer from a disability : Blindness. As a child, your parents tried to hide you from the Inquisitors, but they failed and you have been enclosed in the Evolutive Jail.\u00a0 But your destiny isn't to stay passively in this prison, because you are the first ever known child blessed by Ecko, able to use the Resonance.\u00a0\u00a0You are now here since 10 years, and you became friendly with all the other prisoners, including Alice, your best friend and the only prisoner to know about your power.</p>\n<p>Today like all the other days, as you're waking up, Alice is shouting your name. After you join her, she tells you that this is time to try an evasion. This isn't the first attempt, but you think it's the only funny thing to do here, so you follow her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this day will not be like the others\u00a0...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e2/7e2620ea97e1152f441284fb06b9ee75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aisuki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
