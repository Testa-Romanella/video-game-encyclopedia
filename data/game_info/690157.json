In this game you play as Miss Snake, you can tell because her head is pink! So, ludicrous. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Miss Snake is a reptile with a fixation on color. She likes to eat the same color that she wears.\u00a0You can eat any color first, but once you do, Miss Snake will change her tail color.\u00a0After that, you need to eat the same color as her tail, or you will lose score.\u00a0On the left, it shows what color Miss Snake is planning to wear next.\u00a0Don't hit a wall and don't hit yourself!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As always, love to hear feedback and thank you for playing!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD/Arrow Keys to switch direction.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b703f8c83e3039a5496d27c39534a02b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheSyXan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
