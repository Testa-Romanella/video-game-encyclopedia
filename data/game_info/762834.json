According to the Ohio State University, there are approximately 3 million people worldwide who had some sort of arm amputation. Imagine all these people unable to enjoy the fun of turning and solving Rubik's cubes; thank goodness, there's Rubik's Touchless...</p>\n<p>Rubik's Touchless is an application programmed in Unity using C# codes, that allows anyone to enjoy the fun of cubing, completely without using their hands by using multiple voice commands to control a virtual Rubik's cube, which is available in 2 modes, including one which is colourblind-friendly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Rubik's Touchless, at least 3 million more people around the world would be able to cube with us together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T18:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2224c374e81ae4cfaf050b98597648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vanness"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
