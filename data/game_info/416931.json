{"id": 416931, "slug": "dpt-dr-pepper-terror", "name": "dP.T. - dr Pepper Terror", "name_original": "dP.T. - dr Pepper Terror", "description": "<p>You play as Little Billy, a kid who is staying with his Pappy over the summer and the man is crazy addicted to Dr. Pepper. So much so that he drinks himself into amnesia and forgets he has had any in the last 30+ years so he's constantly asking Billy to go fetch him some more from the store. Today, however, was different. Today, he asked Little Billy to get a case of Dr. Pepper from THE SHED. OooOOoo spooky. No really, the shed is crazy scary. Good luck, have fun. Gameplay is about 15-30 minutes long depending on how much you explore.</p>\n<p>There are two endings. One of which is pretty elusive. You'll have to big-brain think outside-of-the-box to figure it out.</p>\n<p>This game is a parody of Dr. Pepper and Silent Hills P.T. I do not own either of these nor do I claim to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95938b281bc92e8037e39aacc1f1c8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroHorrorArcade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
