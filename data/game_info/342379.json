Combine 4+ color blocks to remove a group and gain extra moves / time (5+ blocks). Connect blocks in a line or diagonally as long as they touch.

Players can take their time choosing their next move.<br/><br/>2.\u00a0<strong>TIMER MODE</strong>: The second play mode is one that produces procedural levels that increase in difficultly along with a countdown timer. Win extra time by activating 5+ blocks together. This requires fast thinking to advance to the next level. You need to keep a clear head and remain calm to advance far on the timer play mode. This mode is not relaxing unless you get into the zone and feel as one with the blocks. :)<br/><br/>3.\u00a0<strong>ARCADE MODE</strong>: Starts slowly, but as time passes more blocks emerge on the board to clear away. The blocks are released from the heavens by the spirits that float around your screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/230cba97e3ff26e3d2a130b0d07ee24c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gazzapper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
