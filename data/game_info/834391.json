Something is wrong... Even though your surroundings are familiar you cannot shake this feeling of dread...</p>\n<p>Delirium is a proof of concept for a game I've been wanting to make for a little while finally put into action. This version of the game is a short story about Diego, the protagonist, as he is confronted by the gaps in his memory and the loss of his right eye in the form of a dream. My goal is to try to create a more full and fleshed out game about him and his world as I continue to practice and learn about game development. This was my first shot at it and I'd love to hear any feedback anyone has about it.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Story: Card.Mythos</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0Card.Mythos</p>\n<p>Programing:\u00a0Card.Mythos</p>\n<p>Music: Brio!</p>\n<p>Made with Bitsy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T12:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f7273954da5c247091ec27d1ccd9e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Card.Mythos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
