To get a feel for the game's mechanics, check out the tutorial (press T from the main menu). Don't forget you can change the game's difficulty levels at the main menu by pressing 1 (we recommend 'Normal' to start off with). Here's a quick controls reference:</p><p><em>Left/Right - Move</em></p><p><em>Spacebar - Jump</em></p><p><em>Tab - Enter decking mode</em></p><p><em>Up/Down - Go up/down staircases</em></p><p>While in decking mode, names of devices will appear on screen. Typing them in and pressing ENTER will hack the device, if it's within your circle of influence.</p><p><strong>More\u00a0Hacking</strong></p><p>I've got plans to extend some of CRP's mechanics into a fuller game at some point, although with a different emphasis. For more information on this game, and my other projects, check out\u00a0Cut Garnet Games' blog.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81acad20382be87e564521fa2d644342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
