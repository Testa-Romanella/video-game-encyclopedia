It is unrealistic to run away from him, it is better to wait until he disappears.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Cross and the Bible - The cross and the bible are pretty good weapons. Someone is afraid of the cross, someone of the bible, it is enough to have it with you, it\u2019s a pity they will help only once ...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSoul sealing ritual - you need to find an apple, blood, feather, wooddu and place them in bowls in the basement, but each item must be placed in its own bowl.
