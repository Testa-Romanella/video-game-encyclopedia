I have been working on it since last year, but it was recently when I took part in a game jam that I felt motivated to return to this and make it more polished. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I made it to this stage. Thank you very much for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b8b1fb064648efe6589c3cbfcb993c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VideoGameKid265"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
