I'd recommend playing with a controller over keyboard because a large part of the experience is in the rumble!\u00a0If you're constrained to keyboard you can play using arrow and WASD keys.<br/>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p>\n<p>If you wanna say hi you can reach me at: thnewlands at gmail dot com or my twitter @thnewlands</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br/>Thomas Newlands</p>\n<p>Almost all of the images in this game come from texturelib.com<br/>and thanks to everyone who has given me feedback so far!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f604afc3e53744a18e50362b27deaba4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Newlands"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
