You are an adventurous squid with a serious case of speed fever. Zip through rings as quickly as you can - moving too slowly for too long will end your game! As you swim around, you leave behind super ink. Be sure, on the next lap, to follow your previous inky path for significant velocity boosts. If you would rather explore the world unhindered, just ignore the timer and enjoy unlimited free play mode<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move with the left stick, arrow keys, or WASD keys.</li><li>Pause with space or start.</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
