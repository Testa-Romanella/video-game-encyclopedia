A captivating sequel to the game \"Deaht Strings,\" which was originally created for a game jam on Scratch. The new game is designed to address the feedback and criticism received for the original installment.</p>\n<p>In this game, you take on the role of a cube named \"Cueb\" (see image below) whose sole objective is to complete easy but challenging levels. However, Cueb has a unique ability to \"Ghostify\" itself whenever it sustains damage, which allows you to traverse through walls marked in red.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>New features in this release</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There also exists new features in this release such as the \"trampoline\" which allows you to go higher than what you would usually get by simply jumping. There is also a \"Gravity Pull\" that allows you to hit the ground faster (be careful with this one though, it's recommended to use this feature sparingly).<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Pro Tip: It doesn't actually matter were you jump so jumping in the air is possible, but you only get one jump before needing to hit the ground again, you can get a extra jump by ether collecting a heart or hitting a trampoline.</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T13:42:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84b706904283a17a8b499ed604a09e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Icelogist"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
