Pass through the ennemy's part of the board, hide behind the chess pieces to no be spotted by the white pawns who stand guard, to finally take on the White King.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by Oliver Christe and R\u00e9mi D\u00e9corne.</p>\n<p>We teamed up and began the project a few hours after the jam began. It's the third one for Oliver and the first one for R\u00e9mi. R\u00e9mi was establishing the universe and doing the art part, while Oliver was programming the game, implementing the assets and designing the levels.</p>\n<p>Since we could'nt integrate every art assets in the game, there will be a \"fake\" gameplay of CHESS INFILTRATION done on After Effects with the art setted as intended during the jam.T he video will come very soon (in the next 24h), we'll edit the page when it'll posted on Youtube.</p>\n<p>EDIT 11/08/2020 : Here it is, enjoy !<br/>https://youtu.be/CmdOYf9AABY</p>\n<p>CREDITS :</p>\n\n<p>Music :<br/>Ludum Dare 38 - Track Ten by Abstraction<br/></p><p>https://soundcloud.com/abstraction/ludum-dare-38-track-ten-game-loop-free-download?in=abstraction/sets/ludum-dare-challenge</p><p>Sound Effects :<br/>Casual SoundFX Pack by Tim Beek<br/>https://timbeek.itch.io/casual-soundfx-pack<br/></p>\n<p>Social medias (R\u00e9mi) :</p>\n<p>Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/kreaki_/<br/>Twitter : https://twitter.com/kreaki_doodles<br/>Artstation : https://remi_decorne.artstation.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce312e45ccc793133acd58759129ddc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["sharkchemist"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
