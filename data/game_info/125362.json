Square, Dude Vs. Blockhead in this old-school style platformer with modern physics.</p>\n<p>Play as <em>Dude\u00a0Blue</em> as you roll and jump around each level plowing through every Blockhead you can find on your way to the warp gate.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Made in 7 days\u00a0for Water Flare's Minimalistic Jam 3.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Right:<strong>\u00a0Roll Right</strong><br/>Arrow Left:\u00a0<strong>Roll Left</strong><br/>Arrow Up: <strong>Jump</strong><br/>ESC:\u00a0<strong>Exit Game</strong><br/>1:\u00a0<strong>Toggle Full\u00a0Screen Mode\u00a0</strong>(during gameplay only)</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The longer you roll, the more momentum you build up, the further you can jump.</li><li>There are only 3 levels in the Jam Build. The last level will just repeat each time you make it to the WARP GATE.</li><li>Only the SPIKES can kill you. Dying will reset you to the Title Screen. Hitting the Blockheads currently just makes them disappear.</li><li><strong>Press 2 or 3 on the Title Screen to warp directly to that level.</strong>\u00a0<ul><li><em>note that the 2nd and 3rd levels are not as fleshed out as the 1st due to time restraints</em></li></ul></li><li>On Stage 1 there is a big Blockhead Door that you can jump right through to get to the WARP GATE. It was intended to have to defeat all the Blockheads to open the door, but time ran out. But feel free to explore the first level to squish them all.</li><li>Enjoy! Let me know if you feel the gameplay\u00a0deserves some futher exploration.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/93015221820599ceb4f8ca198609e62a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GPACgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
