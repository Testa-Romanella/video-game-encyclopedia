And no one remembers how had evil came and chaos reigned. However the equilibrium was lost. But there is still a hidden bond between the columns. And the only those who comprehend it, could restore the frozen equilibrium.   <br/><br/>* For those of you, who don&amp;#39;t like cool epic legends... ;)<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to bring ice blocks back to zero-level.<br/>But it&amp;#39;s not so easy, - all blocks are connected to each other.
