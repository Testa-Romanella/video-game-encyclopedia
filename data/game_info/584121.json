With this assignment, our job was to create an escape room concept, in which the player's job is to solve riddles and move around a map, to find their way out of the room! In this case, my game is about the player, who is asleep and can't wake up no matter how hard he tries. He navigates his \"dreamscape\" in an attempt to escape his dream, so enjoy this room escape!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/dddca3296ba4bee7a9e757512f15e626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake@ButlerCC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
