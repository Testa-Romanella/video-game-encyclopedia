He was a top researcher at his company, enjoying the financial rewards and the intellectual satisfaction of a job well done. Then things went south. A shake-up at the company landed John a one-way ticket to the South Pole, a fool's errand to an abandoned research site. Marooned in Antarctica, John struggles to find a purpose.<br/><br/>Can he get to the bottom of what happened at HQ? <br/>Can he return home and reunite with his family?<br/>Or is he just another Antarctic fragment, destined to end up adrift in a snowbank?<br/><br/>THE BREAKTHROUGH:<br/>You know escape games. You love them. It's you, in a room, four walls. You move around and try to find the light of the day. But the room is static. It may be 3D, but it lacks a dimension -- time. What if events happened in sequence, and you had to find a way to turn back the clock?<br/><br/>In Antarctica is played like a series of panels in a comic book, with events unfolding before you. You'll have to search the room and interact with your environment to change the outcome of events and save John from the brink of danger.<br/><br/>This is the closest thing to time travel you will ever get, so stop building that DeLorean in your basement and start playing this game right now.<br/><br/>FEATURING:<br/><br/>- Lush, handcrafted CGI graphics!<br/>- Achievements: as if exploring nooks and crannies and finding fun dialogue wasn't enough, we've added further incentive to leave no stone unturned!  <br/>- Amazing hairdos!<br/>- Pathos and human drama!<br/>- Snow!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/383/3835ced1034f7b7228c38ac344a31680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["STUDIO ANASTROPHE"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["aseishi hirotaka"], "esrb_rating": null}
