The goal of each game is to find and destroy the enemy HQ's while defending yours against attacks. I recommend starting with the campaign mode as it gradually showcases most of the climates/equipment types. There is a tutorial section in the main menu which should cover most features. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them in the comments.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a03/a03977d99d291fd271abea96b35dc258.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VeryTacticalS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
