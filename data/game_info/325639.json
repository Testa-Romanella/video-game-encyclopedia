The player and enemy factions exists in each other's negative space. Adding to one environment removes from the other, and vice versa. When a block is destroyed, it's added to the other faction's territory.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move Mouse</strong> to control camera.</li><li><strong>Mouse Click</strong> to select a movement destination for the PC. She'll move there if possible. You can interrupt\u00a0 and\u00a0change this in real-time.</li><li><strong>Use the number keys to select your action (1-5).</strong><ul><li>1: Shoot. This toggles open/closed\u00a0a targeting view to fire. You must click on an enemy or other target (like the start game \"button\") to fire. You have a maximum ammo capacity of three shots. You can only fire if you have shots available.</li><li>2: Reload. This reloads your (1) Shoot action to its maximum capacity of three shots, if it is not.</li><li>3: Grenade. This toggles open/closed a targeting view to throw a grenade. You can click on any tile to throw a grenade. This carves out space for the character's collision environment, taking it away from the other faction's terrain. This has a cooldown.</li><li>4: Heal. This heals some HP for the user, if they are not at maximum HP (100). This has a cooldown.</li><li>5: Create Cover. This toggles open/closed a targeting view to create a positive space tile from the user's negative space (inverse of Grenade). You can click on any negative space tile without a unit inside to create cover. This has a cooldown.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Press Spacebar</strong> to toggle the black/white shader. This can help clearly identify the negative/positive space for each faction. This is automatically turned on when the (1) Shoot action targeting is toggled on, but it can be turned on/off at any time.</li><li><strong>Press F11</strong> to toggle fullscreen. You can resize the window in windowed mode as much as you like to any aspect ratio, regardless of monitor resolution.</li><li><strong>Press Escape</strong> to close the program.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Press R</strong> to restart the game.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Press F10</strong> to take a screenshot of the game. This PNG goes to your User Local AppData. It may be hidden depending on your PC settings.

The black-and-white shader that can be toggled on/off with the spacebar or (1) Shoot action is more properly monochromatic, with only two color: black and white.</p>\r\nExtra Kuleshov Effect \u2716\r\n<p>We had some ideas for utilizing the Kuleshov Effect, but unfortunately they required more art and/or music assets that we didn't have time for.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T16:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c6/8c619d759152da5081888fd9363454cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
