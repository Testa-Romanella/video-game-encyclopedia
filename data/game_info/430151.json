A simple game which is created by lazy game developers you can say. This game is just the first version. It will receive updates like sores bar, high score bar or Sounds and musics etc. I make free games. Here is another free game \"Flappy Bird\". It would be your time passing game. Yet the 1.0 version has not much features. But next versions will have that I noted on plan books. I want you guys to let the game enjoyed for free!</p>\n<p><strong>Rules of the game:</strong></p>\n<p>The rule is to not get collided with the other things. You'll need to save the flappy bird from getting collided by anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>There are only two controls for the game, so the game must be easy. Press the up arrow key to move up and press down arrow key to move down quickly.</p>\n\n<p>My decision is not to make money. But on some games you can support me by donating, which will help me to make more beautiful and interesting games for you guys!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d8c813e6fdd7b3883839951ade7cf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jumma Game Developer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
