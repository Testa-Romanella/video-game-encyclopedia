Caring for each of your plants is a fun rewarding challenge to keep them healthy and stress-free.  From Sniklefritz to Pineapple Express, each strain has different needs and preferences. Become an expert grower by mastering the individual care of each plant.<br/><br/><br/>MORE TOOLS, MORE POWER (insert grunt)<br/>From hand tool to power tools, a variety of fun and playful equipment are available for the industrious farmer.  Use hoses to water plants from a distance, and hedge trimmers to quickly harvest and tame your crops.  <br/><br/><br/>HEAT: HiGHER RISK, HIGHER REWARD<br/>Do you run a squeaky-clean operation, in full compliance? Or do you risk everything for a shot at fortune?  You accumulate Heat for growing more plants than you have a license for and doing business with shady characters.

Follow all the rules and avoid risk for a more casual experience. <br/><br/><br/>YOU'RE NOT ALONE: MEET YOUR QUIRKY CREWGrowing all these plants is hard work; hire some friends to MAKE your farm flourish.
