This is to follow the Jam theme: Start with nothing. As the 2048 games are about starting with low tiles and building them up to something better.</p>\n<p>The balancing of this game isn't amazing, however after the jam has been finished I want to look at changing the game a little to be better!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing &lt;3</p>\n<p>Find me on Twitter:\u00a0 @SaMitchinson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T02:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/5403a49ee67b5cc28fd5f44ae757168f.jpg", "website": "https://www.playnanoo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["NANOO COMPANY", "ScottDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["NANOO COMPANY"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
