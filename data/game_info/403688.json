Many of the amateur street and rally racers have seized this opportunity to put their skills to the test like never before. Numerous gangs and factions have sprung up to compete in the cities, towns and forests throughout Russia, but rumors tell that the best racers have found their way to Kazan.</p>\n<p>If you want to be allowed in to this not-so-underground society, you must prove your worth and your skill. Explore the city, find supplies, and scope out the area to learn which faction controls where. Then, provide them with the resources they need before offering them a race. If you can gain their respect, you can then work your way up and expand your notoriety across the city. Maybe a team will even accept you as one of their own drivers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:34:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df83ca5a4905d97316e553b6fca168d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stranger"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
