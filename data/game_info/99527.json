Her friends have unknowingly agreed to a death game! <br/></p>\n<p>Their first \"game\" has them in a dilemma. One person must grab the key in the middle of the room to free the others, but whoever takes up the role will die!<br/></p>\n<p>Can these five friends live through Joyful's Escape Room and capture the ghoul who has abducted them?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setting<br/></strong></p>\n<p>For a long time, magic users and races such as the Orcs and Elves have remained in hiding in fear of what the majority may think of them. That hasn't changed until one day, a few brave warriors revealed themselves.\u00a0 A boy named Yuuthan and his friends became known to the world as a type of magician called the Element Controllers. Since then,\u00a0 courage and hope began to spread. Those in hiding have been brought to the light once more. And this solidified once Time Controller Enith Bloom briefly led the modern era in a war against the Past and the Future, revealing what the world has been and what it will be. <br/></p>\n<p>But none of that has to do with Shirley and her friends. Though, it is thanks to those events that they get to be just a regular group of friends heading in a not so ordinary situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characters<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shirley<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>A young stoic woman whose interest is usually elsewhere.

Or perhaps there is more heart in him than most realize?
