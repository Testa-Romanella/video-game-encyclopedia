I had loads planned, but hardly any of it is in here!</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure what to call it in the end, so decided on 'Malarkey'! I also didn't have time to sort out the walking animations, so it looks very rough. Sorry!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy what I have managed to coble together.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>WASD (or arrows) </strong>- Movement</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Interact with world (ie Fires)</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Item pickup</p>\n<p><strong>Left Shift</strong> - Speed up time (to save time while warming up)</p>\n\r\nStarting Position\r\n\n<p>You start outside so keep an eye on your temperature at the bottom of the screen. If it gets too low, your health will start to\u00a0 drop. Equally, there will be prompts regarding food and water. If you use SHIFT to speed up time, it will also increase the speed your thirst and hunger increases, and how fast your health drops - everything increases (except walking speed).</p>\n\r\nInside\r\n\n<p>When inside, you are protected from the elements and can use the heater (if there is on) to warm up. The fuel slowly burns down and it will eventually go out. If you have a fuel cell (red thing!) and use it while next to an empty fire, it will refuel it.</p>\n\r\nThe old local shop!\r\n\n<p>I had to rush this one, so there are quite a few issues. But I had a lot of fun making it too :D\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d83931a465b9873c0f7dc3e58faddca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Odd Socks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
