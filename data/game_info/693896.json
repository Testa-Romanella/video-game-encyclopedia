You will go trough his daily life and meet people on the way of discovering how and what he feels.</p>\n<p>This is just my attempt at writing a multi-choice story. I'll be learning how to write code and will try to make video games but I also had this idea and just wanted to finish something. Game was made with Squiffy and I had no experience with it so please excuse it's blandness. This is also an experiment on my part for the time loop thingy. I always wandered why no one uses it to express that boring and repetitive life style of ours. Don't know how well I pulled it off but here's to hope that I did a good job.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/263/263563d24ea280e1aff8cda25babbd5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CircilusVitae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
