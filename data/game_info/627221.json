{"id": 627221, "slug": "river-adventure", "name": "River Adventure", "name_original": "River Adventure", "description": "<p>River Adventure is a parkour game where your main objective is to complete different sets of obstacles along a river. The game features a beautiful scenery with lots of greenery along with a waterfall. As you reach this waterfall, you can jump down to arrive at a calm atmospheric lobby where you can meet people who will tell you their own personal stories. A very clean, slick and fitting main menu is there to help you navigate if you want to quit, check out who made the game or learn the basics of the game. Pete the fisherman is an NPC that will guide you in your journey teaching you everything you need to know about this awesome game.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are different obstacles such as chain saws, scary jumps and moving platforms, each one of these has its own difficulty to master. The player is mainly meant to continue the course of the river, as well as the parkour itself, therefore the surrounding trees and decoration are not meant to be played in. The exception of course, is the lobby at the end of the level, which is an area meant to be explored and looked at.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/4819dc608b7d952ef1c0ec24f69dcf74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gabrilondo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
