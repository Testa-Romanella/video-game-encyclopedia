Please see https://team-coconut.itch.io/mind-over-manam for the main (1st person puzzle) game. Submitted for the second milestone for Thesis I at NYU, and as a final project for Audio in Digital Games class. All work on this intro build was done in November and December.\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Playtime:\u00a0~30-45 mins</p>\n<p>Featuring original music and voice acting.</p>\n<p>Content Warning: racial slurs and jump cuts. mild eating noises and crunches.</p>\n<p>Recommended Specifications: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080, Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM (we're still in the process of optimizing, but the game should be compatible with all Oculus headsets).\u00a0 If for whatever reason you have trouble running the game, please feel free to watch the playthrough video below. The capture is at a significantly lower framerate than what someone with the recommended specifications should experience when playing the build.</p>\n<p>Please Note: This game can be played seated or standing; you can optionally re-center the rig at any point\u00a0by pressing down on the left analog stick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, much of the <strong>voice acting and sound design\u00a0in the game is</strong> <strong>provisional</strong>. The parental figure in the beginning, for instance, would be an older\u00a0motherly female voice in a later pass.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>***</strong>The audio in the build below was mixed for an Oculus Rift S; you may notice inconsistencies on other headsets (such as volume and frequency distortion).<strong>***</strong></p>\n\n<p>A full playthrough of the intro (the version that was submitted for the second thesis milestone at NYU) is provided for your convenience (apologies for the lower framerate in the capture):</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f464479f7e1eb2e3e39aa52268aae779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["team coconut"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
