Developed by Eli\u2019s oldest and most brilliant friend, Dr. Janice Barnes, SARA is both a gift and a refugee,<br/><br/>As you play, WATCH OUT, Eli has made some high-profile enemies along the way.  And this technology CANNOT fall into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>Good luck, and may The Verse be with you.<br/><br/>Story development by Julie Ann Emery (TV\u2019s Better Call Saul, Preacher)<br/>Gameplay development lead by Christian Moe (Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering)<br/><br/><h3>Play with Science</h3>Experience an episodic game following Eli, a deep-space moon mining mastermind working on the next big thing. LithoBreak combines fun gameplay, advanced science concepts, and a deep Sci-Fi verse.<br/><br/><h3>Chemistry and Materials</h3>Every material gathered starts off as a combination of real crystal compounds.  When utilized directly, the amount of each compound determines the final material properties.  Otherwise, the base compounds are utilized directly in material processes, such as separating Silicon metal from Silicon Oxide through a reduction process.<br/><br/><h3>Orbital Mechanics</h3>Everything in game, including the station itself, is part of an orbital mechanics simulation.  As the station orbits the moon, the moons, planets and stars \u2018move\u2019 as well.  Materials needing to be transferred from site-to-site will also utilize this mechanic to determine movement and travel times.<br/><br/><h3>Engineering Processes</h3>Every material processing technology is based upon scientific principles and real process technologies.  This includes sifting ceramic powder by density, maintaining elemental conservation, and ensuring a thermitic reaction processes are properly \u2018energetic\u2019.<br/><br/><h3>Realistic Surroundings</h3>The station was designed with engineering oversight, giving the space the feeling that someday, this could be real.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Explore a storied space station filled with background of Eli and the greater verse<br/></li><li>Mine materials with unique elemental makeups and engineering properties<br/></li><li>Process and refine materials using processes based upon properties and chemistry<br/></li><li>Produce parts for mining equipment, with quality based upon material properties<br/></li><li>All parts wear out over time<br/></li><li>Move parts and materials around with spacecraft following orbital mechanics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T03:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/583cb478638efecabe5e59900d868dc8.jpg", "website": "https://www.taucetilabs.com/lithobreak", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tau Ceti Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Tau Ceti Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
