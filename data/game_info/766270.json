To add insult to injury, some idiot has left all his wagons and packing cases cluttered around these old mines (and also coincidentally forsook them in the most inconvenient passageways). Now it is time to develop your most tactical stratagems in the art of pushing around boxes like a maniac. While this is a game in which you may be able to run fast, at the end of the day, it is your enormous brain that will let you continue playing.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Move\u00a0- WASD / Arrow Keys / D-Pad\r\n</p>\n<p>Undo\u00a0- Space / X-Button (X-Box Controller)\r\n</p>\n<p>Run\u00a0- Shift / A-Button (X-Box Controller)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f078cbfd73cc3ab73acbfe585f999b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RAC-Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
