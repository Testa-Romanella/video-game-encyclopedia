My first</p>\n<p>computer was a C64, and it was the entry point to my career as a computer\u00a0</p>\n<p>engineer. Nostalgia swept me away, so I decided to write a game, and apply.</p>\n<p>My first idea was a logic game, and as a first step I decided to code a\u00a0</p>\n<p>Minesweeper-like game, to check if it fits to 10 lines. Then I also started to\u00a0</p>\n<p>experiment if I can mimic the visual vibe of the original Windows game on C64\u00a0</p>\n<p>character screen.</p>\n<p>At this point I was not satisfied with the results:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- I had some characters left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Generating the whole minefield at startup was long and boring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- I wanted more action.</p>\n<p>After some trial and rewrite I decided to try to add a twist and make an arcade</p>\n<p>version based on the original concept. And the result is Minefield Survivor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prepare for the action!</p>\n<p>So, you are controlling a soldier on a minefield, starting at the bottom of the</p>\n<p>screen and head to the top. You can move step by step, and you need to avoid</p>\n<p>mines based on the numbers you recover on the field. To make your life even</p>\n<p>harder, beside the mines you are also threaten by enemy fire. As in real life,</p>\n<p>one hit kills you, so reaching higher level with increasing number of mines</p>\n<p>really requires patience and concentration, and sometimes also luck.</p>\n<p>The soldier can be controlled with the keyboard:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Q, A (up/down)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0- N, M (left/right)</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start and survive!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T11:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eec5be2ee4d7fa184d044be84af33c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
