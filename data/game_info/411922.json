An army of mechanical bots tend to the facility's inner workings, their jetpack a vital utility for navigating the strange, ever-changing architecture.</p>\n<p>It just so happens that on occasion that these pipes spring a leak.</p>\n<p>This project was born out of a simple idea. I realised that I wanted to actually finish projects instead of leaving them abandoned, so I forced myself to finish this. It might not be amazing, but I hope you have fun with it regardless. Apologies for any bugs!!</p>\n\n<p>Font:\u00a0https://managore.itch.io/m5x7<br/>Contains music (c) 2019 Joshua McLean (mrjoshuamclean.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T03:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92eff971277db08f31f16b8b95f83ae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dawn Nyan :3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
