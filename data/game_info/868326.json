All you need is your friend's IP address to join their game!</p>\n<p>Your rockets will bounce off walls and explode on contact with players or props. You can explode your shots in mid-air by right clicking or by shooting again. You have a double jump and a dash at your disposal - do everything you can to stay on the platform! Your dash will also reset your jumps, giving you a bit more mobility when you need it. Your damage will go up the more you get hit, making you more vulnerable to being launched. Other players will see you turn more and more red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was my first attempt at working with Unreal. It was made as part of a 3-day game jam on a team of 3 people, using mostly default assets. I personally made the map, contributed to the game's design, and added a handful of other features. Overall we were very happy with the end result and it's a lot of fun to play online with others. Bear in mind that this is only a prototype and can be prone to crashing or general bugginess. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T07:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362d1ab9c8268e6332bb3c224c4bfd50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Mrazik"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
