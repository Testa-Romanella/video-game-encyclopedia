Use it to simulate FPV goggles! Real FPV goggles use the same image for both eyes resulting in no motion sickness. <br/>This is the default behavior when VR is enabled, it's like watching a big movie screen, there is no motion sickness.<br/>Of course, you can enable the stereo mode and experiment with a new level of FPV immersion. This mode is not comfortable and is subject to motion sickness.<h3>Inputs</h3>The simulator works with both gamepads and real radio transmitters. A calibration process helps you to configure your radio transmitter.<br/>Calibrations are stored in a file that can be shared with friends that have the same radio transmitter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T04:26:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bf64ac676d56808e73f0c69eea28145.jpg", "website": "https://www.demonixis.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Demonixis Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Demonixis Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
