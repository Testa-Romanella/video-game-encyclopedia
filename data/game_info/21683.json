Grab a martini and ride your private helicopter to the snow capped mountains and hunt down the riches you so rightly deserve. Jump, dash, and rappel your way up the sheer mountainside to scratch out a little profit and meet the demands of an increasingly angry board of directors!<br/><br/>Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike features snow, helicopters, ugly holiday sweaters, non-denominational penguins, a title screen, dope beats, ethics, torches, reverse monetization, hot tubs, non-candied canes, falling, ropes, and non-refundable holiday cheer.<br/><br/>Follow @DevolverDigital on Twitter and join the Devolver Digital Super Fun Club on Steam for more fun and games. Sometimes free games. But not all the time, it would make Fork Parker sad.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-03T06:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54ca1e652cab52ba0f6f41df654db0c.jpg", "website": "http://store.devolverdigital.com", "rating": 2.09, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 27, "owned": 723, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dodge Roll"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
