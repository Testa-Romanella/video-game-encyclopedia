You controll a ship and your one and only object is to get to the end of the level in the least amount of time. Use wasd or the arrow keys to steer and boost with the Space bar to go faster. The ship and game info will be located in the top left corner. Theres one easter egg level so look out for that. I know this game turned out to be SUPER hard and I had plans to balance it more but I never got around to it so I'll just upload it as it is now. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/701a2e0de55ed715ee12e8f3aa1b1716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["David Styrbj\u00f6rn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
