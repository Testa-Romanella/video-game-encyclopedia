The theme was \"Joined Together\".<br/><br/>In this game you fight evil kitchen utensils with a mixer and a toaster whose controls and health pools are joined together.<br/><br/><br/>Controls:</p><p>\u2022 WASD to move the Toaster and rotate (then shoot) with the Mixer.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Arrows to move the Mixer and rotate (then shoot) with the Toaster.<br/><br/>\u2022 About shooting:\u00a0Both the Mixer and the Toaster have two bullets to shoot at a time. They will reload as soon as the projectiles are not on the screen anymore. Before shooting in a direction, the toaster and mixer will have to\u00a0rotate to that direction.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ramon Selles (with a highscore of 55!), for his arrangement and orchestration of the Barcarolle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f7feace70b26b2d7385f549770d5598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaVici", "Quinten Heijn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
