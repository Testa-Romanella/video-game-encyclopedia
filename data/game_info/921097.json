Everytime the tree grows, you will gain a random new ability - but also, the monsters you face will become stronger and more powerful.<br/><br/>The game is played with Mouse and Keyboard, though we also have included the option to play with a Guitar Hero guitar, because this is a Gamejam and why not.<br/><br/>Use\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong> to move your character. Click the\u00a0<strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> to unleash all your attacks, if their cooldown is available. Click the\u00a0<strong>Right Mouse Button</strong> to use your defensive abilitiy (which you will gain upon reaching Stage 2).<br/><br/>The more\u00a0<strong>Roots</strong> the tree is able to grow, the more maximum health your Guardian will have, and the faster Yggdrasil will be able to grow and give you more powerful abilities.<br/><br/>While most monsters will target the Roots, some will hunt you down. Make sure you don't die, as this will end the game.<br/><br/>Now good luck, Guardian, and protect Yggdrasil!<br/><br/><br/>Download the OST here:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Vg-7aWG1x8agv3uVF30y4m075AcD4tV/view?usp=sharing<br/><br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/><br/>Art by<br/>Inka McAtee (KnotHorn Studio) &amp; Markus Kr\u00e4utner<br/><br/>Key Art by<br/>Tsumi<br/><br/>Coding by<br/>Manuel Bu\u00df (KnotHorn Studio)\u00a0&amp; Timm Bugla &amp; Robin Trurnit<br/><br/>Gamedesign by<br/>Bj\u00f6rn Loesing (KnotHorn Studio) &amp; Robin Trurnit<br/><br/>Sound &amp; Music by<br/>Tsumi &amp; Bj\u00f6rn Loesing (KnotHorn Studio) &amp; Lajos Boegner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a17f066a42ae1b60e70fdc8bef7c8957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KnotHorn Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
