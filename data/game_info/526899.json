Both were made in their respective time constraints, I added a bit more to this version.</p>\n<p>There are only a few differences as I intend to come back and finish the game and correct some of its bugs. The changes made were adding audio for jumps, a scrolling background and more effects to the player.</p>\n<p>I managed to add an achievement system, but it still needs to show that the achievements have been unlocked, for now it will only show what the achievement is and if it was unlocked when you play the game. You cannot see it unlocked in the achievement menu. If you earn multiple achievements it will block the scene. So I will fix this later.</p>\n\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\n<p>-Art-</p>\n<p>kotnaszynce (https://opengameart.org/users/kotnaszynce)</p>\n<p>laavis (https://www.artstation.com/laavakala | https://opengameart.org/users/laavis)</p>\n<p>thekingphoenix (https://opengameart.org/users/thekingphoenix)</p>\n<p>PauR | Paulina Riva (https://www.patreon.com/paulinariva/creators | https://opengameart.org/users/paur)</p>\n<p>Sasquatchii ( https://opengameart.org/users/sasquatchii | https://sasquatchii.itch.io/pixel-parchment-ui-kit)</p>\n<p>-Audio-</p>\n<p>crazyduckgames ( https://crazy-duck-games.itch.io/ | https://opengameart.org/users/crazyduckgames)</p>\n<p>SPANAC (https://www.freesoundslibrary.com/duck-quack/)</p>\n<p>MixKit (https://mixkit.co/)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58eac84edc25d69af8c100b5d3ba2e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MelloBot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
