You control a spaceship that is moving at a constant speed. You can only make the ship change direction by selecting a new input vector which gets added to the current destination point. Each time the ship reaches its current destination, it then moves along the currently selected vector. Input vector options are automated: two options are presented to the player at all times. If neither option seems interesting to the player, he can generate a new set of options by pressing a button. That way, the player can cycle through options to try and steer the ship through the debris belt without taking (too much) damage</p>\n\r\n\"Your first ten games will suck, so get them out of the way fast.\" - The Art of Game Design\r\n<p>Taking this advice to heart, I decided to dive headlong into game design and start with a small prototype about the size of a game jam game.</p>\n<p>Debris Belt is my very first prototype, and while it has some glaring issues, it was actually very exciting to play it for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is my very first game prototype, I am very curious for any and all feedback. You can leave comments at the bottom of this page or visit my Reddit page.</p>\n\n<p>The art assets for this prototype are supplied by <strong>Kenney</strong>, you can find their website here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T11:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/26422b896d49d45b7c446d6ec336ce80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["hotcupoflava"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
