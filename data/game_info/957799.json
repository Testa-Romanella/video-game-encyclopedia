But it's nothing you aren't used to, just gotta handle all the -\u00a0<em>weirdos -\u00a0</em>that walk into the store. Same as always for the cozy and warm\u00a0Eleven-7 night shift.<br/><br/>[any resemblance to people or places in life are purely coincidental]<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>- A cast of really odd customers coming in. Who knows what's compelling them to stumble in at midnight the way that they do, but you should probably make sure everything goes smoothly with them if you plan to keep your job.<br/><br/>- Count and manage money. Duh. It's a store, hope you have enough coffee to help you through the loose change.<br/><br/>- No other employees! You already know well enough why no-one else would take this job on, so you're gonna have to run the place all by yourself. Make sure nobody is doing anything they shouldn't be, look around often, and keep the store in line.<br/><br/>- Ambience that just, really makes you\u00a0<em>feel</em> like you're working at a job you don't want to be at.<br/><br/>- None of this is still real, it's just for a mockup jam.\u00a0But you could probably work at any similarly-named stores and get the same experience in life.<br/><br/>- The downloadable has all the same screenshots and a cute cat drawing!\u00a0<br/><br/>if you wanna make this a game idea, you can try but my friend already called dibs on it so get owned</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T12:38:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9adc89be693842b636cb97127391a38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BLeKy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
