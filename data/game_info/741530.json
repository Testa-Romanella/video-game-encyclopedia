You only have one idea left!  But it\u2019s for a really unique sort of spacecraft\u2026</p>\n<p>So begins Negative Spacecraft, a game about collecting ideas and dodging \u2026 well, all sorts of things, really.  Sometimes even the empty spaces!</p>\n<p>Negative Spacecraft is a hard game to describe.  It is a SHMUP, in its very deep down roots, but it plays very differently.  The closest description is probably a crossover between Ikaruga, Shoot the Bullet, and that crazy touhou \u201cBad Apple!!\u201d video.</p>\n<p>You play a spacecraft tasked with reabsorbing rogue ideas.  But you have one very unique ability to aid you on this:  You can reverse yourself, so that everything that used to be solid is now empty space to you, and perfectly safe!  Be careful though, because now things that used to be empty are suddenly perilous zones of danger which will blow you up if you touch them!</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need it though, because these ideas are no slouches!  Be prepared for a new kind of danmaku action as you weave, dodge, and occasionally reverse your way through over 35 crazy levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T01:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a228ecb2061906176873e156f78189e7.jpg", "website": "https://www.addictinggames.com/action/negative-spacecraft", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
