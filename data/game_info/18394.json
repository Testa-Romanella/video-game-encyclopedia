But most of all, it was silent. Nothing special ever happened there, until...<br/>One sunny summer day, when, as usual, nothing unusual was happening, a very unusual storm came out of nowhere...<br/>It's the kind of thing you don't quickly forget. Rumbling thunder, lightening... at times it appeared that the heavens themselves had fallen to the ground.<br/>From that moment on, the people in Silentville started disappearing - one by one. Even the visitors suddenly disappeared without a trace.<br/>Airplanes and birds, trains and pedestrians, drivers, tourists and even bicyclers - all of them have vanished!<br/><br/>This is the story of Silentville - a town with no future, no past and no present. A town lost to forever - unless someone can solve the mystery and release Silentville from its cursed non-existence.<br/><br/>But should that someone fail, they will be trapped in Silentville... forever!<br/>P.S. <br/>For all players we'll offer a bunch of adorable collection of collectible items - 10 trading cards, 10 backgrounds and 10 amazing emoticons!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-14T20:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e1c346e7cb08ba397063171324bd27.jpg", "website": "http://jetdogs.com", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 177, "beaten": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 43, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 604, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["2 Monkeys"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jetdogs Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
