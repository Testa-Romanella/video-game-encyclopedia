Use your terraforming space suit to erode, rebuild and alter the asteroid cluster to help you explore for probes - but get back to your ship to escape. Made for <strong>#AIJAM 2015</strong>.</p><p>CONTROLS - Movement<br/></p><p>Arrow keys - Move</p><p>Space - Jump</p><p>Shift - Use a boost jump in mid-air (get more boosts by collecting batteries)</p><p>CONTROLS - Terraforming<br/></p><p>Q/W - Decrease/Increase erosion. Erosion is good for creating small gaps to squeeze through or creating small steps.</p><p>A/S - Decrease/Increase densite. This is the best way to clear space or make more platforms.</p><p>R - Apply changes</p><p>ESCAPE - Cancel changes</p><p>TIPS<br/></p><p>Save your boost jumps for getting back up to your ship. Don't explore too deeply or you might find it hard to get back up!</p><p>If you're stuck, try decreasing erosion and see if it helps reveal new passageways or small platforms.</p><p>THANKS<br/></p><p>CLAY is all possible thanks to Adam Saltsman's Abandonauts art, HaxeFlixel's Cave Generator, sounds by Julian Ray, JavierZumer, adeluc4 and Kodack, and love from Garnet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/3744d5449e37ce6b49ddd3e90d292263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
