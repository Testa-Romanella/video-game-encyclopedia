I will delete this when week 7 gets released on its own itch.io page.<br/><br/>..I got lazy last time making the description, so here I go, giving more information about this file.<br/><br/>The .zip file is for devices with slower wifi, low-end devices, or devices with not that much space left.\u00a0It's more lightweight and has optimized downloading speed. The mod support and cutscene files I've provided are the full FNF Week 7 experience. The difference between the two is quite self-explanatory. One has mod support and cutscenes, and the other doesn't.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adfe90b0f9526f907c55b14f06e287de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["TWDagger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
