The theme was 'delay'.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: This game has a bug. Sometimes your projection will spawn in the middle of the room, and not inside you. I have no idea why it's happening. I tried to fix it after 3 hours, but nothing helps. It seems like it is just random. Press 'R' to restart the level, If this bug ruins your experience.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Also, sorry for my terrible English. It's my second language and I was stressed out during the creation of the game...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, this game took me about 8 hours to make, including coming up with ideas, eating, going for a walk, compiling, looking for music, and fixing this stupid bug. Hope you enjoy my game at least a little.</p>\n<p>Play in full screen for better experience.</p>\n<p>Here are the tools I used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2019.4 (well, yeah...)</li><li>Blender 2.82 (levels)</li><li>JetBrains Rider (c# IDE)</li></ul>\n<p>And the assets I used:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Mystical Theme\" by\u00a0Alexandr Zhelanov, (link,\u00a0CC-BY 3.0)</li><li>\"Dark Fallout\" by\u00a0remaxim, (link,\u00a0<em>CC-BY-SA 3.0</em>)</li><li>\"Water Temple\" by\u00a0el-corleo, (link,\u00a0CC-BY 3.0)</li><li>\"Winter feeling\" by\u00a0Tom Peter, (link,\u00a0CC-BY-SA 3.0)</li><li><em>Sound effects from\u00a0</em><em>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</em></li></ul>\n<p>When I started developing this game I could not believe that it's possible. 3 hours is like nothing for 3d puzzle game. I spend some time just looking up for the tutorials I may need before the start. I even tried to guess which bugs can I accidentally make... After this, I took a 2 hours rush, and then finish the game with 3 little breaks. This. Was.
