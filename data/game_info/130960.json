This game is not about just blindly shooting at everything that moves - it's survival first, high-score second. The enemies might have some really nasty surprises in store, but they always follow the same patterns. Patterns you can learn and exploit. You will (probably) die (a lot), but each time you learn the pattern and can adapt to it better, until you finally beat all 20 waves.</p>\n<p>TITAN interceptor is a fangame using assets based on original designs and artwork fomr \"Fratured Space\"\u00a0trademarked/copyrighted by Edge\u00a0Case Games who have given the creator of this game express permission to use their trademarkes/copyrightes assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/028/02830fb57864975d555caed481d4d63c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hypergrip"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
