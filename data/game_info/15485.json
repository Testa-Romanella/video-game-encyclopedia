Your job is to collect all the crystals while avoiding the mines \u2013 not to mention the 12 breeds of nasties and their bullets that soon turn up to try and stop you. Once you collect all the crystals, an exit at the bottom of the screen opens up so you can escape. Sounds simple? All the best games are \u2013 the depth of gameplay emerges from the simplest of pretexts.<br/><br/>Crystal Quest Classic is a revival of the 1987 award winning video game. The original was played on almost every Macintosh computer in existence before being ported to the Apple IIgs, Amiga and the Game Boy \u2013 followed many years later by a reawakening on the Xbox360.
