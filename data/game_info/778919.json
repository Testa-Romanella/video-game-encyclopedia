Not knowing how to confess her feelings, Mer could only watch as her more confident brother, Alfred, took her love away from her.</p>\n<p>But there's more to the story than this - a centuries long tale about people capable of manipulating dreams... and people willing to do anything for this power. As a Heartling - the most powerful person in Oneiron, the realm of dreams - Iris is exposed to a danger that's lurking way, way too close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And she doesn't know that yet.</p>\n<p>Plagued by nightmares, Meredith decides to get things she knows off of her chest. What she'll say, and how the conversation will go, depends entirely on your choices.</p>\n\n<p>This project wouldn't be possible without the help of following people:</p>\n<p>GUI by Jaime Scribbles Games (scribbles.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Sprites and logo by Yami (yamielsun.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Background/title screen by Jazz (edgessystem.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Proofreading by Emily-Lynn (linktr.ee/Cen_lynn_designs)</p>\n<p>Ali, Domi, Wikotria, Jersey, my cats and all the people that supported and believed in me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fc43c9310a8a1e49776eb75d8b24d38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Naarel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
