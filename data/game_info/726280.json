Some deviations from the original include the ability to select certain parameters of the game, having multiple \"food\" (mice), and the mice move randomly around the game area!<br/></p>\n<p>I created this game as my submission to the first WASM-4 Game Jam and learned some more Zig along the way. I really enjoyed this process and looked forward to each time I could work on it. I've been a professional programmer for a decade but have not done much game development. So while this project wasn't technically difficult, it was great for game-dev education. The minimalism of the WASM-4 fantasy console certainly kept scope in check and kept me motivated.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Note: you may need to click in the game element for it to gain focus and listen to key presses. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/610/6109196820648e2dbe4e921e143e7ba1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["freiguy1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
