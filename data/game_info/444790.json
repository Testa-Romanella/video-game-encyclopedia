{"id": 444790, "slug": "e-motional-escape", "name": "E-Motional Escape", "name_original": "E-Motional Escape", "description": "<p><em>E-Motional Escape</em> is a platform clicker game created using the Godot Engine for the Godot Wild Jam #21, and written by Bryan Miller.</p>\n<p>Except for the <em>Godot Wild Jam</em> graphics, all images were created by the author. All sounds in the game are Creative Commons from various authors (Data/Sound/Attribution.txt lists which sound came from with author)</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>In <em>E-Motional Escape</em> you are tasked with navigating a little emotional ball (E-Ball) around a labyrinth to find the exit (currently, there are two levels plus a \u201ctest\u201d level used during development). Depending on what you do, or don\u2019t do, the E-Ball\u2019s emotions will shift between <strong>Aggression</strong>, <strong>Neediness</strong>, and <strong>Contentment</strong>. Each emotional state has a different effect on the E-Ball and triggers different environmental obsticals. <strong>Aggression</strong> is easiest to build up, and allows you to push the E-Ball the furthest and fastest, at the loss of fine control. <strong>Neediness</strong> builds when the E-Ball is at rest and the mouse cursor is far away from the E-Ball\u2026 it enjoys the presence of the mouse cursor\u2026 and the E-Ball will move itself towards the mouse cursor (but not while in the air). <strong>Contentment</strong> is achieved when the E-Ball is calmed either by the mouse hovering over it for a time, or gently keeping the E-Ball in the air, but the E-Ball will not move nearly as fast when content\u2026 preferring to take things slow.</p>\n<p>You may need to keep an eye on the E-Ball\u2019s emotions, as different emotional states will open different doorways.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, E-Ball can find some environmental help from the particle winds. However, the particle winds will only push the E-Ball if it\u2019s own particles closely match that of the winds. Thankfully, the E-Ball can find pools of colored liquids that can be used to match the E-Ball\u2019s particles to those of the winds\u2026 however, the liquids can also affect the emotional state of the corresponding color!!</p>\n<p>All of this can be navigated with a single (left) mouse button (or, optionally, the \u201cz\u201d key on the keyboard). When held down, a green arrow will appear pointing away from the E-Ball in the opposite direction of the mouse. When the button is released, the E-Ball will be pushed in the direction of the arrow. The further the mouse is from the E-Ball when released, the stronger the push will be.</p>Source Code<p><em>E-Motional Escape</em>'s source code is open source and available at on Github<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:37:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/434102251ea7e038ba0d1f8a868adbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
