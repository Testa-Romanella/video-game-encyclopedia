The player controls the slime - Metablob. The goal is to get to the exit with it as quickly as possible. The slime can use different tile features to jump higher, or stick to walls. There are also obstacles such as spikes, lasers or periodically fired gas. Fortunately, Metablob can use his special skills, such as special drop and baloon form, which allow player to activate mechanisms and avoid dangers.</p>\n<p>Presented demo is made in Godot Engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T01:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/802294de018bbb8ab8dd46dac852482e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["TinyHeart"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
