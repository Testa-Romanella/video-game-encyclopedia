Presented in-game future is dark, mostly due to the fact that life is possible only deep underground, in caves and crevices. In order to prevent the full extinction of all life forms of the face of the earth, some people invented the time machine that will help to locate the beginning of the chain of events that brought their world to ruin. Fay, one of the few time travelers, has to convince Bent Svenson, that his recent discovery of bacteria based biofuel is the only key to the survival of the planet in the future. <br />\nNew Beginning consists of 11 chapters, where the player will control Fay or Ben. It is not possible to switch between characters interactively, but the story and gameplay are direct and straightforward. Final Cut was brought to the Steam 3 times and met rejection because Valve Corp. considered their target audience not interested in the genre in general, but Daedalic Entertainment succeeded and brought the entire line of their products to the platform.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2012-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/943d7d9779bc7dc548285889ca5384ff.jpg", "website": "http://www.earth-game.com/", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 124, "owned": 1691, "beaten": 70, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 31, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 126, "suggestions_count": 563, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 126, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment", "Lace Mamba Global"], "esrb_rating": null}
