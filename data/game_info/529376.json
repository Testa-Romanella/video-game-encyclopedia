But it is feature complete and you are able to finish the game so that's nice. I'm releasing this just so it doesn't sit forgotten on a hard drive somewhere forever.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like this game and would like me to finish it then be sure to let me know either here or twitter (I'll get your message sooner on twitter @depdrawers if its super mega urgent).<br/></p>\n<p> The \"0\" key on the numpad acts as enter and \"skip\" in game. You have to alt-f4 to get out of the game and the options menu doesn't work yet, sorry!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/474e6c76b1e9904ac2ab461827172ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DDD Wares"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
