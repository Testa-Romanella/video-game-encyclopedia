As a big fan of classic games from the Atari to the Amiga, this was a ton of fun to make!<br/><br/>The included games are:<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Astro Clash</li></ul></strong><br/>Smash the asteroids that are hurtling towards your base! Big asteroids are slower but do more damage, and split apart to shower you with trouble. Your ship is safe, but if your base takes enough damage, it's game over.<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Shark Park</li></ul></strong><br/>Steer your fish to avoid hungry sharks and belligerent fish. You can eat any fish smaller than you - eat enough to grow in size! Fish the same size or larger will kill you, so watch out until you grow to MAX size when you can eat everything but the sharks. Remember to dash out of trouble!<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Ski Fall</li></ul></strong><br/>Hit the slopes, but watch out for the giant snowballs rolling across the piste! Aim between the flags to avoid a time penalty, although just touching them is usually enough.
