However, this game is not going to be that way at all; a lot less detail will be left to the player's imagination, but there will be flexibility in the character build, dependent on choices. I'm going for something ambitious here, without it being an open world RPG...</p>\n<p>I hope that you will enjoy Ramsey's journey...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10de4554103eb84cba51323cf9892b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KBGaming&&Music"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
