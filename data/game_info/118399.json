But, killing is really fun, so honestly just slaughter as many cyborg soldiers and velociraptors as you can. </p><p>At the push of a button, you are transported to the same area in the future/past. Use this power against your enemies to launch deadly ambushes, disappearing and reappearing in an eyeblink. </p><p>Instructions: <br/>Arrow keys: Move and jump <br/>Z: Short range plasma blade attack <br/>X: Time travel (toggle between future and past) </p><p>Your health is denoted by your energy colour. Each hit changes the colour: Green, then amber, then red, then GAME OVER. Get as many kills as you can before this happens. </p><p>You will regenerate health automatically by avoiding damage. <br/>_________________________________ </p><p>I'm also happy to announce that I have implemented Global Highscores!
