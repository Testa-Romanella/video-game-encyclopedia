Watching your crops grow and defending them from the cute bugs is always a nice escape from reality. However, it seems that every time you take your headset off, something in the room is different\u2026</p>\n<p>Escape is a game about multitasking. You must split your focus between protecting your crops in your \"VR\" game and checking on the mysterious happenings in your home. You can switch freely between the view of the game and your room, and the \"VR\" avatar will match the position of the character in the real world. Protect your garden from bugs while keeping your cool in the \"Real World\" to get through the night!
