Work with a walking plant in this isometric rouge-like bullet hell. Delve into madness acquiring curses that amplify your abilities of extermination, but at the cost of your sanity. The cult of Kannis has sent you into their infested lower levels to exterminate the brood of an experiment gone wrong, the Conlura. Eldritch star nosed moles with a taste for the arcane seek to halt you and your Kannis plant. Staff in hand, your ability to purge will be dependent upon how many curses you can bear. (Introduction addressing the player) Loyal hierophant, at each altar, ensure the Kannis plant completes its cultivation ritual. Its pervading spores will root out the Conlura infestation in our forgotten depths. Push the vermin further into the earth until our sacred depths are free of their incursion. Reclaim runes you come upon for their power will embolden your efforts of extermination, but we know, great strength will always come at a sacrifice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdf7fef56b3023353bc5bafc54b55bfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["OccamsLazer", "Kainkun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
