After his character\u2019s dramatic death in the final act, though, it\u2019s up to his right hand man Mamarou to take the spotlight! Suffering from a mild case of stage fright, Mamarou only manages to focus by imagining himself as an actual Meiji era samurai warrior!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is an extremely short one. Like, five minutes of playtime maximum. Full disclosure, this project is actually a slight edit of a game I created for a Japanese history class. I figured with a slightly different context, some sprite changes, and a Kunio-Kun reference it wouldn\u2019t stick out too much from everything else I post, so here it is. Despite it being very short and very basic, I still hope you enjoy it! And thank you as always for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/81369ea16ced42117f1fa979e10890a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
