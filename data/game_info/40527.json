{"id": 40527, "slug": "atelier-iris-3-grand-phantasm", "name": "Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm", "name_original": "Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm", "description": "<p>The story takes place around a city called Zey Meruze, that resembles Venice in that it is crisscrossed by water channels (with Fairies offering a gondolier service.) However, Meruze also has portals to other dimensions, called &quot;Alterworlds&quot; where, for some reason, humans can&#39;t stay for more than a short time (they eventually are magically transported out.) Iris (who in this game is still an amateur alchemist) and her friends Edge and Nell work as &quot;raiders&quot; for the Raiders Guild, an organization that performs tasks for people for a price. Usually these involve missions into the Alterworlds, but can also be as mundane as finding missing pets.</p>\n<p>The game follows Iris&#39;s team as they rise through the Guild&#39;s ranks. The real story, however, involves a sealed book that Iris owns-- and which contains an enormous power that can only be released by finding eight &quot;gem-like fragments,&quot; so she endeavors to find all eight of them.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2006-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-26T09:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b3c/b3c2ae61c7655fa684172b434721d573.jpg", "website": "http://www.nisamerica.com/games/ai3/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 24, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Gust"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["NIS America"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
