The fun is in using the lootbox system to receive randomized\u00a0champions and hoping to get lucky. The player needs to balance their \u201creal\u201d life (within the game) and their play of the game (within the game) to maximize the number of lootboxes they can open.</p>\n<p>The game is intended to draw attention to the many contemporary mobile games which utilize this free-to-play, microtransaction-laden skinner box design to addict players to their game and compel them to spend large amounts of money. <em>Gacha: Save the World</em>\u00a0is designed to strip away as much of the aesthetics and create a fun experience using the fewest resources possible. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/281/281f36b7d3e9ffbf64c869455005e7c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarti Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
