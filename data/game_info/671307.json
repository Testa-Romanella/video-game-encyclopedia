Theme: \"One Room\"</p>\n<p>----------------------------------</p>\n<p>Back then we could not think of a really fitting game for the theme so we played around the words and decided to make a dungeon crawler where your goal is to reach the ONE room, where the most precious treasure is kept. Can you beat the 10 floors and claim your prize?</p>\n<p>3 distinct units with 3 different skills:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The warrior (power attack, shield wall, bloodlust)</li><li>The wizard (firebolt, iceblock, teleport)</li><li>The archer (piercing, poison shot, camouflage)</li></ul>\n\n<p>You main problem will probably be the energy bar - which is basically hunger. It decreases each step and you must open chests to find food to recover it. The chests can also contain different gears and consumables.</p>\n<p>The game is really unbalanced and the pace is... not good. But we achieved the core functionalities we wanted, and the result if somewhat fun. Hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>TEAM:</p>\n<ul><li>Fiote\u00a0[Developer]\u00a0(https://twitter.com/FioTactics)</li><li>PhanxGames\u00a0[Artist]</li></ul>\n<p>----------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>TECHNOLOGY:</p>\n<p>The game was done in JavaScript.
