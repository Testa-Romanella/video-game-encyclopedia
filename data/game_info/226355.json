Colored tiles can only be swiped off through their same colored side panels. More tiles appear after the moves counter reaches zero so be mindful and strategic with your swipes. Each time you swipe a tile off the board your points go up. The higher your score, the harder it gets! Hone your strategy and keep the game going for as long as you can to increase and maximize your score. See if you can reach level 8 to win!<br/><br/>Track your top and average SwipeOut scores over time with our stats tracker.<br/><br/>You can play our SwipeOut game by Razzle Puzzles on your phone and tablet.
