She spent years on the run, honing her skills to confront her brother who shunned her and stole her position as master of Snowfox Valley.<br/><br/>My main focus on the game was to find various ways of using sacrifice as a core function in combat. I\u00a0used a part of my upcoming game Trials of Proelium to speed up the map design process so I could focus primarily on the gameplay mechanics and story.<br/><br/>My game Trials of Proelium can be found here:\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1749020/Trials_of_Proelium/<br/><br/>Interested in my work?
