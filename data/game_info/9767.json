{"id": 9767, "slug": "hollow-knight", "name": "Hollow Knight", "name_original": "Hollow Knight", "description": "<p>Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.</p>\n<p>Most of the game&#39;s story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.</p>\n<p>The game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. </p>\n<p>The Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T22:58:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4cf/4cfc6b7f1850590a4634b08bfab308ab.jpg", "website": "http://hollowknight.com", "rating": 4.4, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 821, "owned": 6460, "beaten": 1532, "toplay": 612, "dropped": 860, "playing": 520}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 190, "ratings_count": 2481, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2534, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Team Cherry"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Team Cherry"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
