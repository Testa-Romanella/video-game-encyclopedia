Seriously, we once came upon a 7 way intersection where one of the streets was crossing itself. How does that happen!? Our game explains that.</p><p>Made in 52 hours on a train by Brice Puls and Ryan Wiemeyer for Train Tam 2015. Additional art by the wonderful Eric Huang.</p><p>Controls: (requires 2 controllers) Left stick and A button, figure it out.</p><p>How to play:</p><ol><li>Select a home and aim your arrow to start a road. Connect homes of your color to jobs of your color. </li><li>Once connected, constituents will drive to work. Each time they arrive you get a point. </li><li>Unconnected colored homes and jobs will slowly generate negative points the longer they are disconnected. </li><li>Grey homes and jobs are neutral and can be claimed. </li><li>Cross over your opponents roads or intersections to create traffic jams that favor your color.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f3/6f34936d5b142e89003a289f1e92c61e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hats", "Brice Puls"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
