In this game, players are rival  museum curators trying to arrange the most prestigious exhibitions of  bizarre and unusual artifacts - unicorn hooves, kraken tentacles, books  of pure evil, and alien skulls, to name a few.\r\n </p>\n<p>Over four rounds, two players will play a series of tricks, trying to  win artifacts for their museums and score prestige. The twist is that  the highest scoring cards are not always the cards most likely to win a  trick, so huge bonus points are available if you can deduce what cards  your opponent is able to play and which tricks they are able to win.\r\n </p>\n<p>With only 20 cards to keep track of, skills in deduction and risk management are paramount.\u00a0<em>Eccentric Exhibits</em>\u00a0is a tense, high-skill game for two players.\r\n </p>\n<p>There is no minimum payment for this print-and-play file. Just pay whatever you want and have fun with it!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/7172f4b706069ef753f46c0302e89517.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobinDavid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
