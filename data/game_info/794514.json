The goal  is to collect ancient ice artifacts deep beneath the surface in order to  create a weapon to stop a volcano about to erupt.\r\n</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You\u2019re  dropped off at Mount Hau, a volcano that is suddenly about to violently  erupt within just 10 minutes! Fortunately, you remember from your  briefing that the volcano is thought to have powerful ice clan artifacts  buried deep beneath the Earth\u2019s crust. Collecting all the artifacts may  provide a way to stop the eruption\u2026but there\u2019s no way you could get  down there with your current gear! You now have to collect valuable ores  to upgrade your equipment and dig deeper and deeper in search of the  artifacts. Can you take the heat, or will your mission to save the day  flicker out?\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Arrow keys:</strong> Move, aim, wall slide\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Z:</strong> Jump, wall jump\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>X:</strong> Swing pickaxe\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Enter:</strong> Pause game\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/154bdc2a2c78cec4560dd2b9edf8f717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cruise Elroy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
