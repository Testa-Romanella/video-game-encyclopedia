There is a way to clean\u00a0and a way to make things look clean, this game is about both. Find the best way to\u00a0Technically Clean and reach the highest score. This gameplay is well supported by our\u00a0lighthearted fun style, animation, UI &amp; sound design.</p>\n<p>The game is built by Team 16 in a 4-week game project at Futuregames, with a dev team of\u00a013 consisting of Artists, Designers, Programmers, Quality Assurance and a Project manager.\u00a0We were tasked with making a game around the theme \u201cCleaning checklist\u201d so we took\u00a0inspiration from the chaotic and lighthearted game Overcooked. The target audience is 15+\u00a0but it would go lower if the narrative did not feature a party.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a team we are very content with our game, and it is thanks to our great teamwork,\u00a0building the game from a small scope and finding a sweet spot where the team's strengths\u00a0are best used.</p>\n\n<p>List the members:</p>\n<p>Oskar Nilsson</p>\n<p>Lowe Karlsson</p>\n<p>Emma \u00d6sterlund</p>\n<p>Linn\u00e9a Blixt</p>\n<p>Adam Olszowy</p>\n<p>Erik Larsson</p>\n<p>Mathias Hjelmqvist</p>\n<p>Sam Nilsson</p>\n<p>Victor J\u00e4rnberg</p>\n<p>Simon Arrenius</p>\n<p>Hektor Andreasson</p>\n<p>Viggo Spele</p>\n<p>Ricky Hedman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:18:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec35a7410a5c22c90b1752887f66ea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
