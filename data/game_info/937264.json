The poisonous waters of the <strong>Styx</strong> are below you, and <strong>Death</strong> is coming for your soul. Run for your life, <strong>Warrior</strong>, and you may find your final grace.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The game is available to play in browser, however WebGL dooes not provide the full shader support required for the PSX lighting and compression that the game uses. To enjoy the PSX graphics fully, it is recommended to download one of the Desktop builds ! :)</p>\n<ul><li>PSX retro looking game.</li><li>Run from death in four different themed levels.</li><li>A mix of endless runner and platformer.</li><li>Levels are randomly generated, as such you may need to start a new game should you come accross a difficult seed.</li><li>A small ending cutscene !</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n\n<p>A <strong>reset </strong>function is available in the pause menu should you come accross a level seed that is too difficult to finish.</p>\n<p>The game can also be paused using the '<strong>P</strong>' key (implemented for the browser version).</p>\r\nWebGL Tips\r\n<p>Here are a few things to improve the WebGL experience :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Set in Fullscreen</strong>. Since the PSX compression cannot be used, I've emulated it by lowering the resolution, however the smaller viewport is under that resolution and will look uncompressed.</li><li><strong>Make sure the cursor is locked to the game view</strong>. You simply do this by clicking on the viewport. You can escape the cursor by hitting '<strong><em>Escape</em></strong>' at any time.</li><li><strong>The pause menu will require 2 hits on the 'Escape' key</strong>. It can also be opened by using the '<strong><em>P</em></strong>' key instead !</li></ul>\r\nClosing words\r\n<p>Supposed to be a horror game in the beginning, the game ended up being a platformer with procedural level generation.</p>\n<p>As always, let me know what you think of the game in the comments or the reviews so that I can get better at making games !</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy this small platformer. ;)</p>\n<p>Don't fall !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T12:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a410c5b88d660ccc45f08d90d579e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fast Extract Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
