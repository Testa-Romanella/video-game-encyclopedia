During your shift, a dangerous gas leakage happens and many of your coworkers die on the spot. You are the lucky one - for now - as the gas is lighter than air and you know, that as long as you manage to dig down, you will survive.</p>\n<p>The name Lidenbrock comes as a reference to one of the most classical books written by Jules Verne, named \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", where a bunch of people lead by a preffesor Otto Lidenbrock lead an expedition into the crater of an icelanding vulcano named \"Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull\" and discover a brand new world below Earth's crust.</p>\n<p>On this game worked:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>-Glow</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Our programmer, resident maniac\u00a0and head of this project.
