You are a bat within this colony and you are competing in the mating ritual and yearly competition to become the champion. Race against a foe in frenzied, 5 level battle for the champion crown or race a friend to see who is the true champion. Race for the flys and the first one to reach to goal amount wins!</music?></p>\n<p>A game where you race and battle 1 vs 1 (VS CPU\u00a0 or 2Players) to be the first one to reach the goal amount.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WHY:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created for practice, motivation and a challenge. I recently injured myself and am looking a long term recovery, I have set forth the challenge of working more in order to learn as much as possible during this recovery.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was create following the rules of this Game Idea Generator I found.</p>\n<p>Link For Generator\u00a0http://ygd.bafta.org/resources/game-idea-generator</p>\n<p>Given the randomness of these rules, I tried a few ideas out, all racing concepts ended up bland and I wasn't able to come up with a prototype. I rethought out the concept of race and made this game a race to reach a score. Added 2 Players last minute.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am willing to update with enough interest, mostly looking for feedback and will apply an update later. Remember this was for practice and not at all intended to be a free way to kill a few minutes :)\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Everything except music was created by me.
