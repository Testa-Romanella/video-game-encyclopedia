When bandits kidnap your people, you set out on a journey to save your family, armed with an unnecessarily large wrench, the worst team ever and an awful sense of humour.</p>\n<p>A powerful, industrial civilisation used to rule the world but now it is gone, and the planet is covered by the toxic Forest. The remnants of the human race live in the Wasteland among the ruins of old factories, wrecked airships and dusty railways, fighting each other and struggling with the abominable monsters the Forest spawns every night.</p>\n<p>The choices you make will shape the world around you, for good or for bad. Your enemies could become your friends, and your friends could become your enemies. Whichever path you choose, it will lead you deep into the Wasteland, where answers to the greatest mysteries wait to be discovered: Why did the old world fall? Where did the toxic Forest come from? And what is actually going on in the Flying City of Manchester?</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Deep and mysterious story of the long-gone civilisation</li><li>Non-linear plot that starts branching at the very beginning</li><li>Negotiate your way through the Wasteland, fight if you have to</li><li>Crazy\u00a0Peculiar characters, including a samurai with an annoyingly strong sense of duty, a mechanic girl who wants to UPGRADE THINGS with her large wrench\u00a0and a prince who values his coat more than his life</li><li>Choices shape relationships between the main characters</li><li>Industrial Manchester!
