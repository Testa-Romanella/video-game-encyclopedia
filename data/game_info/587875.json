I\u00a0collaborated with 4 other students over the course of about a month to fully design and build this game from the ground up. We were given the constraint that it had to be made in to fit into a pre-existing franchise that we weren't allowed to choose: <em>The World of Ethshar</em>. <br/><br/>For this project, I\u00a0developed an adaptable grid system using C# to act as the foundation for our game and tile-movement. I also designed UI, backgrounds, the mock-up box art,\u00a0and other miscellaneous art assets in Clip Studio Paint.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made by: Alessandro Fiorella, Liliana Klein, Carson Lampila.
