Then the code was transcoded line-by-line to 68K assembly. The 'core' code is platform-agnostic and calls out to an operating system dependent (OSD) layer written for each target platform.</p>\n<p>The original target is the Neo Geo (AES/MVS/CD). It runs in 'tate' mode.</p>\n<p>Subsequent targets include the AGA Amiga.</p>\n<p>In theory the core can be ported easily to any 68K target that can support the resolution, number of sprites (performance) and palette.</p>\n<p>PROGRESS:</p>\n<p>The core transcode is 100% complete. One \"last\" gameplay bug to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>The Neo Geo target is playable with sound on an emulator and also on real hardware (tested on an AES with NeoSD cartridge and NGCD). Beta1 has been released (https://tcdev.itch.io/xevious).</p>\n<p>The Amiga target is playable.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<p>- game play is identical to the original arcade game, including the pseudo-random</p>\n<p>\u00a0 number generation</p>\n<p>- original dipswitch options supported (except cocktail cabinet mode)</p>\n<p>- all original graphics and colours reproduced perfectly on Neo Geo target</p>\n<p>- 1 or 2 players supported</p>\n<p>- high score load/save</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>- Mark McDougall (aka tcdev): reverse-engineering, core and Neo Geo code and assets</p>\n<p>- Jean-Francois Fabre (aka jotd): Amiga code and assets</p>\n<p>- Andrzej Dobrowolski (aka no9): Amiga music</p>\n<p>- Namco: original game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74bbabb935466499b549d3d1ae9b17bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jotd666"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
