The best way to classify Tiki Tandems is a fun party game to play with your friends! But you can also queue up against anyone in the world and fight for the number 1 rank. The fighting style is somewhere in between Brawl Stars and Super Smash Bros but with 1 key difference. The players do not have health or knock-back bar and you can fight each other as much as you want<br/>So what is the main goal and how do you win then?<br/>Both Tikis fight over the grace of the Totem. In the middle of the 2 players, there is a big Totem which decides who wins the match. The Totem can be turned by both players all the time by hitting one of its 2 wings. Depending on the angle and distance between the players and the Totem, the totem rotates in the appropriate direction with the appropriate amount. The first Tiki to successfully turn the Totem by 180 degrees wins the match!<br/>There is also a second functionality to the Totem. If you were to turn the Fists of the totem you increase your Dedication to the Totem. The more dedication you have, the more powerful your attacks become<br/>Tiki Tandems is a fast-paced game. The game is meant to be very straightforward and easy to play for anyone. There isn't a huge skill cap but you definitely need practice to be the best at the game. We wanted to make the game accessible to as much of a wider audience as we can, so whether you are playing at home with your friends or grinding against players worldwide you can always compete with everyone. The matches last 3 minutes, so that you can play many rounds without being stuck playing against 1 person. Or if you are playing a local tournament on one machine, everybody can play without having to wait a long time, similar to Tekken-style rounds", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T06:53:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca2542a478809e5f4684028a70b1c026.jpg", "website": "https://www.tikitandems.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M3DS"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["M3DS"], "esrb_rating": null}
