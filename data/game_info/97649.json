It was originally released in 2011, and is now available to play in your browser for free!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\nThere's also a standalone version for Windows and Mac OS X with added controller support and extra customization options. Be sure to check \r\n\tour Itch page for more great games!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>How to Play<p>\r\nUse the Arrow Keys to move and Space to shoot. Destroy enemies to get points and coins. Collecting a coin will add 1 second to the timer and missing a coin will take away 5 seconds from the timer. If you get hit by an enemy bullet you will lose 1 life block. If you lose all your life blocks or run out of time, it's Game Over!\r\n</p><p>\r\nNote: scores will be reset in the browser version if you close the tab or window the game is in, so take a screenshot before leaving if you get a high score and want to keep a record!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e8e4ff99fe3ebc5b9fa821646d1a7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["1CC Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
