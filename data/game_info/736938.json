Working as a low level administrator for the finest theme park to ever host realistic dinosaurs you have found yourself in quite the pickle. Due to a probable accident on your part, <em>the velociraptors are now loose in the park.</em> They\u2019ve killed and eaten the CEO, head of security, head of research, plucky child hacker and the local game hunter specialist, and now they thirst for even more human flesh. They\u2019re a lot less scarier than what we know of raptors from the movies, but the little ankle biters can still shred your ankles to pieces using their biting ability.<br/></p>\n<p>The only thing protecting you at the moment is the Administrative building\u2019s lockdown system. But due to other factors that were probably an accident on your part, the system is running out of power. There is little food, no communications and little time left before the raptors get in.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only hope is the helicopter on the other side of the parking lot. If the five of you can get to it, you\u2019ll be good, but there\u2019s no way the raptors won\u2019t notice you.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only option left is a sacrifice. One of you must distract the raptors long enough for the others to get to the helicopter. Lucky for your lack of debating skills, everyone else\u00a0has already talked it over before you got back from your break, and they\u2019ve decided on your behalf that you should be the one to make this honourable sacrifice.</p>\n<p>You have an hour before your death. Take this time to reflect on your life, wander the building, and think about how you got into this situation. Do not use this time to escape for yourself.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f74bfd8ecc6c9324f92e87c8b337fba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shariku Onikage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
