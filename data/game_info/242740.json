It's all\u00a0about practice: you must restart the brutally difficult adventure over and over, the ship changing every time - and no configuration is the same. Can you defeat the alien robots taking your ship hostage -\u00a0 or will you just die every time you try?</p>\n\n<p>Game made by Ryan Mickey from Flemington, NJ. Worked on over the course of about 4 months.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move with WASD</p>\n<p>Aim with Mouse, Swing with Left Click</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fd346aa0250acbf8099523c0babeff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game-U"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
