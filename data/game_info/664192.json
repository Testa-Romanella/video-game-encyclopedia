{"id": 664192, "slug": "pac-mans-sky", "name": "Pac Man's Sky", "name_original": "Pac Man's Sky", "description": "No Man's Sky in Pac-Man (pre-pre-alpha)\r\n<p>Dive into this unique concept of classic Pac-Man gameplay connected with No Man's Sky exploration experience. <br/></p>\n<p>Travel through the universe full of planets. Each planet is a randomly generated, unique Pac-Man world. Explore them to find 10 cherries and finish the game!<br/></p>\n<p>This project of mine was started in 2017, and I forced myself to finish it into a somewhat playable game in a week. It's still lacking some sound effects and gameplay polishing, but I'm letting you play it in this unfinished state anyway.<br/><br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys </strong>- control Pac-Man</li><li><strong>P </strong>- pause the game</li></ul>\r\nFuel\r\n<p>Your spaceship needs fuel to run. Collect pellets (and ghosts) to refill it. If you run out of a fuel in space, you lose.</p>\n<p>Once you have enough fuel, you'll have access to a launchpad that is located within the ghost house.\u00a0With\u00a0it, you\u00a0can\u00a0leave the\u00a0planet\u00a0and\u00a0traverse\u00a0to\u00a0other\u00a0ones. Make\u00a0sure\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0enough\u00a0fuel\u00a0to\u00a0reach them, though.</p>\r\nGhosts\r\n<p>Knowing how ghosts behave will help you finish the game more easily. There are four ghosts that behave exactly like the original:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Blinky (red)</strong> - follows your current position</li><li><strong>Pinky (pink)</strong> - tries to predict your movement, following position 4 blocks in front of you.</li><li><strong>Inky (cyan)</strong> - stays between you and first Binky (or first ghost) to leave the ghost house.</li><li><strong>Clyde (orange)</strong> - tries to get near you, but as soon as it's near you, it retreats.</li></ul>\n<p>All of these four ghost have a \"retreat\" period when they all retreat to their retreat points, placed on furthest points from the ghost house of the planet.</p>\n<p>On top of that, there are four more, brand new ghosts that never retreat:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Cringy (green) </strong>- picks random path.</li><li><strong>Kinky (purple)</strong> - tries to keep the distance, following position 3 blocks behind you.</li><li><strong>Liney (blue)</strong> - goes in a straight line whenever possible.</li><li><strong>Bob (brown)</strong> - ghost with a social anxiety; tries to keep its distance from everyone.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d1faf4238e73bf0472817e749d6ad98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krzyhau"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
