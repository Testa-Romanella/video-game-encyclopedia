In 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover, first contact with aliens not only manifests some phenomenal structures, but also provides Workers Guild 7 the ability to build their own futuristic village. In exchange for gold and precious gems to repair their craft, ancient aliens share their technology and expertise in architectural construction.  But building these megalithic structures takes the workers away from their families for far too long, so the aliens agreed to designate a village plateau for workers\u2019 families and transport it from Wonder to Wonder.<br/><br/>7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover whisks you away to the Temple of Solomon, G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Puma Punku, Ancient Dwarka and other ancient alien theorist proposed visitation sites.
