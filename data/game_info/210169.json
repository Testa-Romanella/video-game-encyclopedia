I hope you enjoy my little anti-drinking PSA :P. No I'm not worried about you drinking and driving, this was just the most practical of all the ideas I had for making a game related to 21 years.</p>\n<p>I had been wanting to make a game for your birthday for years, but never had the confidence to follow through until this year. I hope you enjoy this gift -\u00a0 a small echo of the very things I made with programming, which coincidentally were also games made with you as my sole demographic and with an educational lesson in mind (even if this one is pretty tongue in cheek).</p>\n<p>You are an inspiration for me, and always will be. I told you many years ago that you are the most important person in the world to me. That is still true, and will always be true. I wish you, not only a great day today, but a continuation of many beautiful years to come.</p>\n<p>All the love in the world,</p>\n<p>Your bro,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Edward</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55272d0526be6041337ec29b8d51d87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FiniteZombie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
