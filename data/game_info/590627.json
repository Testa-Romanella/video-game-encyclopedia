It was the year when millions of players assumed the role of rookie cop-turned-secret agent Leon S. Kennedy as he traveled to rural Spain in pursuit of Ashley Graham, the president&#39;s missing daughter. A watershed moment in gaming, Resident Evil 4 was a reinvention of both its series and its genre - not to mention one hell of a party.</p>\n<p>More importantly, Leon had\u00a0amazing\u00a0hair. Oh, and he flipped over lasers. For many, he entered the hallowed halls of video game heartthrobs in the same way he crashed through two-story windows: suddenly and with swag.</p>\n<p>But we all know Leon&#39;s story. What about Ashley&#39;s? For the players of Resident Evil 4, she is, at best, an objective; at worst, a liability. A human cog in a well-oiled gameplay machine. But what if she was more than that? What if she was an interesting person, thrust into a crazy world with crazier men who run the gamut from hottie to hellspawn? How would she narrate this nightmare and who would she actually fall for?</p>\n<p>Wonder no more. This is her story.
