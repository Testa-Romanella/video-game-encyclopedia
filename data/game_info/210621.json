The early prototype started in September and has been developed further to an Alpha state. The project has currently been paused since I have no one to do the character art so I can further implement new code and enemies. I have every script in place which I can further develop on, I just need to make new character skills and enemy behaviours that need art. #Skills #Combos #Experience #Level-up #Engine #4k #Dialogue #Licensed-Content #Weather #Stats.</p>\n<p><em>The core engine is almost ready to be made into a game with 10 levels, which by then I might change how the gameplay plays out in the next 10 levels. There are 2 playable heroes and one enemy. The enemy is just walking back and forth. I am planning the 10 levels to be a match against collision detection (with maybe one more enemy with a different collision box), and then I might add one more enemy that maybe flies and drops stuff.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6b6f6d0768d952f5b08144881ad80e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beupe"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
