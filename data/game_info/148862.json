Players are able to change the level by blasting walls and floor tiles.\r\n This makes it possible to push players out of the game board. Blasting game objects makes the board inevitably lighter on one side, \r\ncausing an inclination.\r\n This makes it harder for the players to move and increases the possibility of falling off the game board.\r\n In addition, pickups are placed evenly on the game board to allow for a diverse and rich gameplay.\r\n The classic bombs are replaced with character specific objects in various sizes with different effects and abilities.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1f89faf2c0683f07fbeb5805bb74af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mschiller"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
