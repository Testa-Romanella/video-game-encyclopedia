{"id": 975206, "slug": "incubus-quest", "name": "Incubus Quest", "name_original": "Incubus Quest", "description": "A war between succubi and incubi has been raging for years in Lugrand, and Shadow was unluckily born as the weakest incubus there ever was.<br/>When the succubi launch a surprise attack and capture or wipe out nearly the entire incubus population, Shadow makes it out thanks to a mysterious power he awakened to. But since he's the weakest, it's decided that he needs to train against humans before taking on the succubi. He teleports to Ardia, a different world where he'll gather experience and maybe make an ally or two. The problem is, he's so weak as an incubus he risks defeat even at the hand of humans...<br/><br/>Explore Ardia and grow stronger before returning to Lugrand to mount a resistance and launch a counterattack against the succubi and their army!<br/><br/><br/>Learn to handle yourself and your foes through many battles. You're weak, but that doesn't mean you're powerless! Battles are as much a conversation as a fight, and you must control the ebb and flow to come out on top by using different skills depending on your current foe's inclinations. Pick your fights based on your current strengths and overcome every roadblock.<br/><br/>Many foes await you, but the world of Ardia has many weaker targets spread across its wilderness areas and the three main cities. Being defeated isn't a problem thanks to your newly awakened power, but actually defeating the enemy may be another matter entirely. Battle as many people as you can and grow stronger before returning to Alvarez to take the fight to the succubi!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dozens of unique foes</strong><br/>On the road to becoming stronger, you'll face dozens of named humans and succubi alike. Each has a different story to tell and will try to exploit your weaknesses in different ways. And if you fail, well... You can always try again! Just try not to get too used to it, or you might start enjoying it.<br/><br/><strong>Sprawling cities</strong><br/>The many settlements in Ardia offer a vast array of activities that will help you grow stronger and earn some money. Casino? Check. Bath house? Check. Secret laboratory with androids and giant robots? Check! Don't waste too much time though. The incubi back home are counting on you!<br/><br/><strong>Character customization</strong><br/>You'll be able to modify some of the main character's features for a more personalized experience. This includes physical characteristics, inclinations, as well as many costumes you'll acquire through the game. Some NPCs get costumes as well, both friends and foes!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T07:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e2f0f08e50ab818ef4f8df43c523c95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SweetRaspberry"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kagura Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
