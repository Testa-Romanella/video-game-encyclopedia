Without doubt, its one of the best experiences I've ever had. Everything in this game I created myself, the pressure to develop the project ensures that no time is wasted and, in my opinion, its let me create something fairly cool in a short amount of time.

I really want to work on the aesthetics and story some more, whilst adding some more features to the game, such as music for the boat, more to do while sailing, things to collect, to build and so much more. Right now I plan to polish the game up, but depending on the response, who knows where it'll go\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f157aa653ccef6a31d85f9a23c7c35f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ethan Kessler"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
