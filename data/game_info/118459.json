You control a mythical creature on a fanciful floating isle, and as you explore this uninhabited space you will trigger emotional changes that affect your character, and hopefully you too.</p>\n<p>MindState was a four week project. It was worked on by a team of game designers who each covered their own set of emotions, we outsourced collaborators for the game's audio, animations, and camera programming.</p>\n<p>This game is playable with both keyboard or game-pad, and it's recommended to be played with headphones.</p>\n<p>Game Design:</p>\n<ul><li>Adam Compton</li><li>Joshua Textor</li><li>Nic Lyness</li><li>Nicholas Staracek</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound Design &amp;\u00a0Audio:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ash Ball</li><li>Chris Ware</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Animation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Macauley Bell-Maier</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Graphic Design:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jasmine Wake</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/220a6d3e61685a923558fed45fa4a921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nicholas Staracek", "Nic Lyness", "A.Crompton", "JoshuaTextor", "JasmineWake"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
