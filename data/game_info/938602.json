Humans fought valiantly, but it seemed there was no hope. That was when the hero, the champion, the slayer appeared. With his superhuman abilities, he faced the demons and defeated them, restoring peace to the world.</p>\n<p>But shortly after, the UAC discovered that they were not alone, the same demonic invasion had occurred in parallel universes to ours. In some of them, the slayer did not exist and the demons defeated the humans. That was when the UAC created the nexus, which allowed connecting all realities. Thanks to this, they were able to create a weapon with which to control the demons.</p>\n<p>With the passage of time, the slayers no longer had anyone to face, since the demons were under control. Therefore, they decided to organize annual survival games. These tests would be administered by the biggest entertainment promoter of the UAC, <strong><em>DRUGOD TV</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>The games consisted of a series of challenges that tested the participants' abilities. Only the strongest, fastest, and most intelligent would survive.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my seventh map created for doom 2.</p>\n<p>I hope you like it and have a good experience.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time.\r\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Doom2.wad file required to play, just copy the file into 'games\\' folder\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: DRUGOD TV: The Survival Games<br/><strong>Version</strong>: 1.2<br/><strong>Format</strong>: UDMF<br/>\n<strong>Ports Tested</strong>: GZDoom<br/><strong>IWAD</strong>: Doom2.wad<br/>\n<strong>Map</strong>: MAP01<br/>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>: Single player<br/><strong>Build Time</strong>: 4 weeks<br/>\n<strong>Textures</strong>: Yes (Included) (based on HakrosTex)<br/>\n<strong>Jumping &amp; Crouching</strong>: No<br/>\n<strong>Freelook</strong>: Needed<br/>\n<strong>Difficulty</strong>: Just one UV++<br/>\n<strong>Dehacked file</strong>: No<br/>\n<strong>Secrets</strong>: 4</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED<br/><br/>\n</strong><strong>Sector light mode</strong>: DARK<br/>\n<strong>Max FPS</strong>: 100 or more<br/>\n<strong>Compatibility with mods</strong>: No recommended, performance issues.\r\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb6453768f753060a658a3f60870b9c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hakros Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
