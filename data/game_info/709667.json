There are two versions: the older original game (which is basically a menu and some weapons) and the updated version, which includes a level and a single enemy.</p>\n<p>This project was the first thing I ever developed to a point where I could show it off. It was created over the course of three years, starting in 2014 and going on until 2017. It is built on a custom lightweight Java engine that I developed and documented with the eventual hope that others would be able to use it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project was developed out of my own curiosity and the help of YouTube tutorials. Specific thanks goes to ScratchForFun for providing me with the Java tutorials I built off to make this game and its engine. All assets are my own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d6efb94d0fd8b8e5a8c55edd6d79e69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sydney Fonderie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
