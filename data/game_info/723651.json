Bang for ROM Game Jam 2013</em></p>\n<strong>Fight in the past to discover objects in the future</strong>\n<p>Travel through time in\u00a0<em>Relic Ravage</em>! First, fight with up to three opponents as characters from the ancient past and from mythology. Then, travel forward in time to compete with fellow archaeologists to dig up as many artifacts as you can for your museum!\r\n</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>Relic Ravage was inspired by the science of archaeology and the way museum collections are created and continue to grow. \u00a0Archaeologists have a hard job, because anything that would have been useful or valuable to people in the past would have been kept safe with them. \u00a0This means that the artifacts that archaeologists find are usually garbage or have been left behind deliberately (such as in a burial). \u00a0As like today, important things are rarely dropped or lost by a person in the past -- we wouldn\u2019t leave our smartphones or cars behind! \u00a0Archaeologists are interested in these types of objects since they show real, normal, daily life, but they are the rarest types of finds, since people don\u2019t usually lose things in places where archaeologists dig. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Today, artifacts found on archaeological digs are subject to very strict\u00a0national and international regulations, meaning that discoveries generally remain in their country of discovery, often going on display at national museums. \u00a0However, earlier in the history of archaeology and museums, discoveries would generally be divided up amongst the archaeologists and their university or museum.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>Much of the ROM\u2019s art and archaeology collection was created by archaeologist\u00a0Charles T. Curelly. \u00a0His archaeological and collecting work in Egypt, Nubia, and Asia Minor was instrumental in building what would later become the ROM\u2019s collections. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Today, the ROM funds many different archaeological excavations throughout the world, such as Senior Curator\u00a0Chen Shen\u2019s work in Northern China, looking at the\u00a0earliest hominid occupations, as well as Curator\u00a0Justin Jennings\u2019 work in the\u00a0Ancient Andes, or Senior Curator\u00a0Krzysztof Grzymski\u2019s work in Ancient Nubia.\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a890038f4e8c2bed1d2760c0433f5fb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
