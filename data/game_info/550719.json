Boasting of 3200+ subjects from a licensed directory of people of all ages and genders, born before 2100, the demo allows the user to experience the memories of one of our Subjects, and free access to 3 snapshots of her memory - memory of her private life and routine, uncensored, unedited, with no bar on how or why it is consumed. Starting from the scene as viewed by herself, the demo utilises its patented tech of using electric devices to serve as eyes to a scene. This allows the user to move their mouse around any snapshot, find what could serve as another viewpoint and click to enter another view.</p>\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>Simone Verduci</p>\n<p>Mugdha Bansal</p>\n\n<p>For\u00a0Global Game Jam 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc58e354efd0a332b2ef818af87040b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pleasure Corp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
