Being a retro-movement shooter, it's a wacky love-letter to the memorable classics like Doom and Quake that defined the FPS genre back in the 90s. With a focus on unique time bending abilities, the player can rewind and freeze enemies in time, as well as enter slow motion and even rewind themselves - all a new way of pushing the boundaries of the classic fps movement system. As such, the game aims to bridge the gap between old and new whilst maintaining a reverence for the formula featured in classic retro FPS titles. The main focus is on packing juicy gunplay, smooth movement, and tight level design all into a bombastic 80s narrative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay sees the player chasing an evil robot mafia through time, battling a variety of robotic enemies through medieval sewers, Triassic jungles and 80s laboratories. This is all skinned as unapologetically 80s blockbuster \u2013 Who doesn\u2019t love the idea of a disco-era laser T-rex?</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Gunplay </strong>-\u00a0The pistol is deadly at range and has explosive rounds, the shotgun is effective up close and bullets bounce.</li><li><strong>Dynamic player movement</strong> - Slide, dash and double jump and the maps feature launchpads, wall runs and dash-rings\u00a0.</li><li><strong>Time-Manipulation </strong>-\u00a0rewind and freeze enemies and objects.\u00a0slow down time and rewind\u00a0it!</li><li><strong>Unique and stylized\u00a0enemies</strong> -\u00a0weird and wacky enemies based on the the time period and a Robot Mafia theme.</li><li><strong>Unique Worlds</strong> -\u00a02\u00a0themed worlds throughout time (and more to come!).</li></ul>\n\r\nNote!: This game is still in early production.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>\r\nFollow our socials for more trailers, game updates and announcements!\u00a0\r\n<p>Youtube</p>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Instagram<br/></p>\n</strong>\n\n\r\nHelp us improve our game by filling out our\u00a0feedback form.
