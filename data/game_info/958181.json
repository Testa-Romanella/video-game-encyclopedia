Player is situated on an aliens' spaceship. Someone has started a fire and panic arises. Player takes action in his own hands, takes a fire extinguisher and starts to fight the fire. Will he be able to manoeuvre in zero gravity with the force of the fire extinguisher altering his movement?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p>The most interesting part of our game is the fact that player controls everything in the game using only the left mouse key. Also the fact that it is situated in space, where player is not affected by gravity and therefore when he uses the fire extinguisher, he is pushed in the other direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T15:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9f0efe5509b1d288f1316ae1d63f0e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["andrea_rea"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
