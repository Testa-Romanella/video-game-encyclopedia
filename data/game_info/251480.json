That is Tap to the Future, and it\u2019s revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Being a god is hard. Evolving yet another civilization from stone age up to space travels is boring, even for a deity. That is, unless they do all the work for you!</p>\n<p>&quot;Tap to the future!&quot; is an idle game where you are a god helping people set up the production in their era and pass the final goods to the next era! Spawn buildings and buy upgrades and watch the hordes of your minions bring resources and produce what you need from them.</p>\n<p>When you play they are running around carrying stuff. When you don&#39;t, they still are!</p>\n<p>In each of the eras you focus on producing a product, which is then passed to the next era as one of the raw materials. Super simple: want to have more incoming goods in Medieval era? Tweak and optimize the production chains in the Stone age!</p>\n<p>Farming, crafting, construction, production: that&#39;s what you are going to be doing in this amazing incremental idle game, without actually doing it at all.</p>\n<p>Dozens of products and resources, hundreds of upgrades, and eons of fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf6927f2d8d7d7c5a9ed5af71bce872.jpeg", "website": "http://on-5.com/2017/10/tap-to-the-future-2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["On5"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["On5"], "esrb_rating": null}
