Cara Maine has just moved to the small and cozy town of Willow Creek, where she's anxious to branch out on her own for the first time. With the help of her bosses, her friends, and the player, she might just start something amazing.</p><p>The run-time is about an hour per arc, faster depending on play-style. There are five main arcs with twenty different endings: a choice-based adventure with basic mini-game demonstrations. The content is as family friendly as <em>The Sims 4</em>, suitable for all ages, but recommended for teen+ (implications of alcohol and \"woohooing\").  <br/></p><p>Stats:</p><ul><li>4404 dialogue blocks containing 67642 words and 362116 characters.</li><li>Average of 15.4 words and 82 characters per dialogue.</li><li>34 characters, 383 backgrounds, 342 character images, 82 choices.</li></ul><p>Recent updates first at: http://oxidentalgames.com/games/dating-sims/<br/></p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>This visual novel is a fan-based parody.
