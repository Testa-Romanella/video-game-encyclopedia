New railways are cheap when laid across bare fields, but can be expensive when demolishing forests, villages and other existing structures.<br/></li><li>Manage increasing traffic by constructing, switches, sidings and spurs so that multiple trains can run without delays, at the same time.<br/></li><li>Stay accident-free by precisely controlling trains during crucial moments, using pause for planning (you can build railways and schedule trains while on pause).<br/></li><li>Play through 4 seasons: Europe (1830\u20131980), America (1840\u20131960), USSR (1880\u20131980) and Japan (1900\u20132020).<br/></li><li>Complete the story mode featuring such real-life events as the Gold Rush of 1849, the construction of the Florida Overseas Railroad, World War II, the Cold War, the launch of the first manned space flight Vostok 1 and more.<br/></li><li>Explore the game in different game modes: in story mode (5-10 minutes), in random mode (15-20 minutes \u2013 the level looks and develops differently every time you launch) or in sandbox-like regime (can be turned on for both story and random modes.
