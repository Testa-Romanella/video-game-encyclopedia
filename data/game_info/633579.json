{"id": 633579, "slug": "liftman-stan", "name": "Liftman Stan", "name_original": "Liftman Stan", "description": "<p>This game was developed in 20 hours for the Indie Tales Jam and was designed for mobile (or webGL) as a very simple clicker game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have created all art assets, audio assets and code within this time. I had to cut some scope-creep features (multiple floor types for example), but I am very glad that I managed to squeeze at least some boss fights in. Balancing games like these are very hard. In a way, this is a simple clicker game where you click either the right or left side (or use arrow keys / traditional horizontal input) to shoot in that direction. The goal is to clear waves of ghosts as they approach.</p>\n<p>The concept ties in with the theme in the sense that the same room keeps recurring, the elevator is\u00a0 the core of the entire game and you never leave it. Literally, the character can not move away from it, eternally bound to fight specters on the many hotel hallways!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c8787ecd7fa47098b34ae7616d04689.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JavaSaurus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
