Not again! Your friend has forgotten his poem scraps in school again, and this time it's 12 poem scraps! Once you get there, you realize that the school now flies in the clouds, and you have to use an airplane to get there! The school is much more bigger, and has a new teacher!</p>\n\n<p>This was inspired by DOS games, e.g. Sonic's Schoolhouse and the gameplay was inspired by Baldi's Basics.</p>\n\n<p>This game fits the theme by being completely random. It depends what will happen. One minute later you will get hallucination, the next minute there will maybe a fire, or flood, or maybe the bell rings and a student stampede appears, etc.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511845dca78981df5a045485d1a8c84c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["gameZ Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
