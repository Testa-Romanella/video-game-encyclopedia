Though his life is a comfortable affair, he is about to step through the looking glass and experience events that will change his outlook forever. Could the simple act of hanging a dreamcatcher over his bed be mere superstition; or is it the one thing that will stop him from losing his mind? <br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <strong>atmospheric first-person puzzle game</strong> may hold the answer. Explore the darkest corners of Jamie's room and solve cryptic puzzles as you aim to rid it of the evil presence lurking within. Will the titular Manit be able to aid in defeating an over-worldly force? <strong><em>Is anything you experience even real?</em></strong> The only way to find out is to drift off and embrace sleep. And if you're lucky, you may even wake up again.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Dreamcatcher </em>was created over a seven day period for the <strong>Brackeys 2022 game jam</strong> and is therefore intended to be a engaging 10-15 minute\u00a0experience rather than a full length game. Though the theme for this jam was \"<strong><em>It Is Not Real</em></strong>\", we do very much hope you enjoy our work. <br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Design and Programming</strong><br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Adam Womersley</strong> - AdamTheWom</p>\n<p>YouTube\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0itch.io</p>\n\n<p><strong>Joel Mann</strong> - Joelzilla</p>\n<p>Twitch\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0itch.io</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Music, Voice and Story</em><br/>\n</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nicholas Holmes\u00a0- PimientoDREAMS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Twitch\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Facebook\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0itch.io\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Spotify\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Soundcloud</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/787/787bc680d902e30f4a6f2dfd826a2c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joelzilla", "Adam Wom", "PimientoDREAMS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
