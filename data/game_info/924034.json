As a team, we decided to make use of a very simple mechanic, the grappling hook, and give it to a small plant, which then has to make use of this to escape the sewers of an overgrown London. The 3 levels this game provides will have the player face a number of obstacles and a lot of platforming, where at the end, it will reach the top of the London Eye.\u00a0 But the journey necessary to get there is a long and harsh one, and our little plant will have to be careful not to fall into any thorns or rivers along the way, or get blasted by beams of electricity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:49:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0ffdf543cf23723a6426acd3ef3194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giovanni Damian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
