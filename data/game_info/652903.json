We love to hoard it, steal it, hide it, ride it, slam it, eat it, swing it, slap it, roll around in it, be its friend, and worst enemy, We are LOOT! Now we just have to keep away from that pesky do gooder knight.</p>\n<p>How To Play</p>\n<p>Join your friends and enter the magic stone circle to be transported into the dungeon. Slimes invade the halls and are easy pray for the Do Gooder Knight. When the Knight slays a slime, it leaves behind a treasure! Be quick before anyone else gets the jump on that tasty shiny loot. You can stash your loot in chests but once all the chests are full, we find out who's horded the most loot of all and crown them the Goblin King!</p>\n<p>(scoring didn't get all the way finished...)</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Cody Elliot - Prop Modeling and Forever hunting The Wild Turkey</p>\n<p>Jay Aschenbrenner - Rigging, Animation, and Wizard of the Mystic Arts<br/></p>\n<p>Cameron Fulton - Programming and Really liking Perogies</p>\n<p>Adam Liepins - Technical Art and Overlord of Shiny Things</p><p>We used some premade sounds and a couple animations but otherwise all assets were built for the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81e2621ce62393100dd65353d2467ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beat1823"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
