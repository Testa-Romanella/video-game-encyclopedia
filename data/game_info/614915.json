The player makes money by selling goods collected by the stalkers in the zone on the blackmarket. And the player can request specific things from the ai characters (i.e collect certain rare artifacts).\u00a0I also want\u00a0many core aspects of the game to\u00a0be driven systematically by stats and/or parts of the simulation layer.<br/><br/>The game in this current state is little more than a simple prototype with 2 ai agents running around the game world randomly and looking for anomaly objects to collect. That's about it; no actual game yet :( .\u00a0There is a player character to run around and look at stuff - hope to add enough pieces to make this a complete rudimentary game (basic simulation with game logic and hud). If I worked on it more during the game jam time I might've gotten closer to a complete thing but I still had fun making what little I did :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T09:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1b6bfd9c87cb577ccf63f85222692b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joshy_kashi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
