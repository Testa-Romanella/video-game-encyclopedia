You take control of a character trapped within a labyrinthine structure together with a hostile enemy character. Your goal is to escape the maze,\u00a0 however, you can upgrade yourself along the way in order to overcome the enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>The enemy character represents a higher class of society, a population of cybernetically augmented people who are more physically and mentally abled to the point where they can even predict the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>You\u00a0cannot win without adopting the products of the enemy culture. Completing the game will require you to become the enemy and, if you choose to kill the enemy, in more ways than just in appearance.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Bryce - UI, Marketing, 3D Assets</p>\n<p>Luke - Programming</p>\n<p>Kevin - Programming, UI</p>\n<p>Leo - Level Design, 3D Assets</p>\n\n<p>Music &amp; SFX sourced from:</p>\n<p>FreeSound.org</p>\n\n<p>Asset packs from:</p>\n<p>Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>\"Low Poly Sci Fi\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Voxel Sci Fi Environment\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb32d3c3998e87f8d56cc976a9de529e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke Archbold", "SANDBOXGames", "raidrDevs", "Seteara Kevin Om"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
