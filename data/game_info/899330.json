You will need to find other ways to navigate through the levels.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made as a school project at UQAC, and is therefore only a prototype. This is why there are only two playable levels.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Marie \tGuillevic\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a02D Assets, Animation, Programming<br/>Pierre\tFourr\u00e9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Level Design, Programming<br/>Samuel\tIsrael\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Programming<br/>Ma\u00ebl Viriot\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Music and sound design, 2D Assets<br/><br/>All team members took part in the game design process<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T13:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b07067261385a2c25c2464f7b149545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eddie Breeg"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
