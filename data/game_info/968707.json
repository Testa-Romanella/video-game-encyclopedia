I dare not say it is a qualified game. With my current abilities, I can only present it as a complete product to everyone, not as a semi-finished product.<h3> Different types of combat modes </h3><br/>The types of troops used by players and enemies are completely different.<br/><br/>Players have eight basic units that can be controlled.<br/><br/>Shield soldiers can reduce the damage they receive.<br/><br/>Javelin soldiers can break through defenses.<br/><br/>Archers have a wide range and can also engage in close combat.<br/><br/>Cavalry can move flexibly, which may cause some operational burden.<br/><br/>The vanguard is a type of assault force that combines attack and defense.<br/><br/>Gunners are important long-range strike forces.<br/><br/>Warlocks are healing units that use spells.<br/><br/>Air raiders can evade most attacks. Of course, like other games, it can pass through most terrains.<h3> Some unexpected situations </h3><br/>Different weapons can cause different additional damage to enemies. You can easily defeat weak enemies based on your level, but weak enemies can also deal these additional damage to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T17:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12edd0fc79ec5c998210cc78765ee5ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5343\u5f71\u8863"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5343\u5f71\u8863"], "esrb_rating": null}
