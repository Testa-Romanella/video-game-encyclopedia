The Sub mirrors the movements of the Jet, (as above, so below) introducing a mechanic where the player has to think carefully about their movements as dodging a missile or rock isnt as simple as moving your pawn, you also have to think how that movement affects your other pawn!<br/>Think 90's Euro Shmup, Bullet Hell 2D Shooter!<br/><br/>The gimmick is, the sub can only hit enemies below the water, and the jet can only hit enemies above the water and likewise both are immune to attacks from their opposites (ie a sub cant hit a jet and a jet cant hit a sub) making for some intense tactical positioning.<br/><br/>Included is a 2P local co op, power ups a boss fight and some killer music!<br/>Special thanks to Cody O'Quinn for the Music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c97c1de6c43954811899afc7b1446285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrumpyMunkyIndy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
