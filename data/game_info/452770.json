Starting out with a team of 4 Austrian hobby devs, two of us kept working on the project after the jam ended to tie up the loose ends and make a finished game out of it. We succeeded to make it fully playable, it has a main menu, proper sounds and is (mostly) bug-free. We clearly see that the game is far from perfect, it lacks an inventory system, there are some issues about the color scheme, but as our first completely finished project we are proud about the progress we made and all the things we learned by working on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have a look at the jam entry: \u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/how-to-raise-a-demon</p>\n<p>*This game should be played in fullscreen mode with a 16:9 aspect ratio, so the UI is fully rendered. Some Browsers might not support this, Firefox\u00a0 has been experienced\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0to work best.\u00a0 Also, there are some issues with the WebGL version (like visual effects not working, stuttering frames), therefore downloading and playing the desktop version of the game is highly recommended for a better experience .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee35396777b4c767aa90425941296c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Green Acorn Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
