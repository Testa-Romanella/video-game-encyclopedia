{"id": 855014, "slug": "discovering-autumn", "name": "Discovering Autumn", "name_original": "Discovering Autumn", "description": "<p>Discovering Autumn is a short puzzle game, and is designed to hopefully not be too difficult (I say that, having done it about 50 times at this point). Walk, jump, click, and drag your way through the levels, collecting the things needed to make some magical mystery food :)</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game, as well as being made in about 1 day,\u00a0so animations and sound are unfortunately a little sparse. It\u00a0was made using gdevelop. All art in the game is art pulled from the gdevelop asset library, and is in public domain. There isn't a particularly wide selection, so improvisation was done for some of the objects (If you're wondering why it looks a little clunky).</p>\n<p>Please refrain from using fullscreen as it's not the right screen size :/ instead just use the zoom on your browser. If the keys are not working, I've found that clicking to another tab and then switching back fixes it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T11:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66eef7b749ab6557a17ff58dbac18cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SammyCrafts_CatClawz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
