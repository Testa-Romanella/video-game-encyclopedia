Yellow squares are power-ups and the gray ones that turn yellow on touch are the checkpoints, if you press R you will be transported to the last Checkpoint you activated. The game so far only has 2 levels but i will be working on it later to add more to it.</p>\n<p>Feel Free to ask any question or give me any pointers will take those to the heart and try to improve for the next one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f854412096c267ff32f0beeeef6d4157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGecko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
