You gain XP from killing enemies, and can use the XP for upgrades, such as fire speed, and max health. More upgrades were planned, but time constraints and an inability to properly code a teleport mechanic broke that.\u00a0<br/><br/>As of now the game only has Level 1, effectively a tutorial, and Level 2, effectively an actual level. Level 3 was in development but I\u00a0ran out of time and had to build without it, unfortunately.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T17:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef4578f1bd6b5e9419a4117568e5ae58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SaltyLily"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
