Some sinners, however, strayed from the path, bringing out the most maliciously treacherous parts of themselves. From this malice came new deities, gaining their powers from the servitude of their subjects.<br/><br/>In the lands of Lemia, home of the primordial Goddess of Light, an endless famine persisted. The poor inhabitants' desire for wealth benefited the God of Avarice, who in turn promised an end to their misery. The god everyone now calls the \"God of Gold\" transformed all his followers into shapeless, tormented creatures: the golden shadows. Lemia, once so luminous, now gives way to unhealthy greed.<br/><br/><strong>Duality: Pledge allegiance and receive the power of the gods!</strong><br/>With a skill tree containing over 50 skills, you can evolve according to your allegiance to the Goddess of Light or the God of Gold.<br/><br/>You can also play double duty, but in this case you won't have access to the most powerful spells. It's up to you to find the best balance for your style of play.<br/><br/><strong>A world for every god.</strong><br/>No more metroidvania with a single map to discover.<br/>In Noreya, the world changes according to your allegiance.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with the Golden World and have now decided to worship the Light? Get ready for a whole new experience, forge ahead as you discover which areas have changed and discover which parts of the game are no longer accessible! However, in turn get ready to explore other new adventures that now await the servant of the Light!<br/><br/>Each version of the world conceals secrets and exclusive bonuses. Can you find the artifacts hidden in the depths of the world? Only time will tell!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The soundtrack</strong><br/><br/>Signed by the incredible duo Sarys / MisterMV, enjoy an original soundtrack that will accompany you throughout your adventure.<br/>Switch allegiance, and the music will change and evolve with you.<br/><br/><br/><strong>A game for arachnophobes:</strong><br/>Initially, we had planned to include spiders in the game, but we realized that many players are arachnophobic.<br/>WIth this in mind, we worked on coming up with an alternative that works and retains the feel of the underground environments.<br/><br/>But who knows, maybe one day the spiders of Noreya will be released. But that's a tale for another time.<br/><br/>Read more on our dev blog:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1760330/view/3712699226995016096", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T06:32:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7440959dcea6b6e555821ae9ca9d9066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Dreamirl"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dreamirl"], "esrb_rating": null}
