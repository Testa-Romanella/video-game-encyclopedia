It\u2019s limited in it\u2019s scope, only on one station orbiting the Sun and it\u2019s mostly a pilot program for the full singularity. Everyone has either died, or sold their digital self to this station, where they mostly work on block chains to decide ones from zeros. These selves are called \u201cghosts\u201d. On the station itself, there are four companies that sell these data blocks to the highest bidder, with the first to the current data block snagging the highest paying offers. This data mining is a highly competitive and companies will hire out mercenaries to disrupt the other companies. That\u2019s where the players come in as mercenaries for a company. Will they follow the companies? Or will they strike it out on their own?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p><p>Be warned this is pretty rough and is only a beta, if there is enough demand I might come back to this later.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebdabea7b2dc2630faa2c31e7de839c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mecasloth"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
