{"id": 23037, "slug": "victor-vran", "name": "Victor Vran", "name_original": "Victor Vran", "description": "<p>Victor Vran is an isometric action-RPG, set in a fictional town, where the player\u2019s character must hunt demons and other vile creatures and rid the world of darkness.</p>\n<p>The gameplay despite being similar to other games in the hack\u2019n\u2019slash genre features unique elements based on player\u2019s reaction. Dodging bullets and moving around hordes of enemies can be tricky, but the game emphasizes that the main way to achieve is not just spamming two skills, but employing techniques and developing character\u2019s abilities in the way that would be comfortable to the player. The different loot system helps the character in his journey, as various weapons have their unique abilities, and often improves character\u2019s skills.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s art style is highly reminiscent of Dracula movies and other vampire-based stories. The grim locations and fearsome enemies leave a mark on any player, and the soundtrack of the game also adds to the overall mood of evil lingering in the dark.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2015-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6d3/6d35c69d8435af5fcd448b08e82c3fd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.37, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 118, "owned": 1769, "beaten": 100, "toplay": 40, "dropped": 105, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 470, "ratings_count": 237, "suggestions_count": 593, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 240, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Haemimont Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EuroVideo Medien"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
