This is a game about shooting a pirate from a cannon to reach the end of the world. The further you go the more coins you earn, the more coins you earn the more upgrades you can buy to your cannon to go even futher! Simple as that!\u00a0<br/><br/>It takes about 5 minutes to complete and I might expand on it in the future so dont hesitate to leave any feedback you can think of!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbf231668a15950cbec41fba1114d580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IcookTacos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
