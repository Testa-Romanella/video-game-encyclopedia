Earth is getting colder.\r\n The world\u2019s governments managed to avoid all greenhouse gasses, so climate change got inverted. \r\nNow there is only one cyber-cat who is able to find a \r\nmysterious artifact in the future and bring it back to the past to save \r\nthe world from freezing.\r\nPlease help us save the planet. You are our only hope!\r\n<p>This game was built for the GithubGameOff 2017. As a cyber-cat you travel to the future in order to get some future artifact to save the world.
