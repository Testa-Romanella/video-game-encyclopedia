You will need to establish a base, mine resources, and build everything the colonists will need to survive. It's one person against a harsh and unforgiving planet where everything we take for granted is in short supply. <br/></p>\n<p>The colony ship is on the way. Thousands of lives depend on you!<br/><br/>Enjoy a small simple survival game where you race against the clock to generate enough resources in order to win. Balance is vital as buildings cannot be destroyed once they are built - so keep an eye on your resources as you explore a map full of easter eggs and fun little sci-fi nods. With any luck you'll only see the happy endings!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5bb6f55628e3d1709d3e645d1eb3d30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Longplay Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
