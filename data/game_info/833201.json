{"id": 833201, "slug": "vote-now", "name": "Vote Now!", "name_original": "Vote Now!", "description": "<p><em>Vote Now!</em>\u00a0is a game created in the context of a university programming class called \"2D Video Games\", supervised by Isaac Pante at the University of Lausanne. In this course, we learned to use\u00a0KaboomJS, which I am using for this project.</p>\n<p><em>Vote Now!</em>\u00a0is a minimalist strategy game. The premise of the game is that you play as a political party aiming to pass a bill in Switzerland by propagandizing to influence voters' opinions. The game plays kind of like\u00a0Reigns, as in you have a choice of 2 actions that you can pick from at a time. The game works using 3 main variables:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Money.\u00a0This determines if you can buy campaign materials. It can be earned by asking for donations from voters or sponsors.\r\n</li><li>Votes.\u00a0This determines how much in your favor the vote is going. From 0 (no voting intentions in your favor) to 100 (all voting intentions to your favor), it will be influenced by purchasing add-space, distributing flyers and organizing events.\r\n</li><li>Optics.\u00a0This determines if your party's image is in good shape or not. It is a modifier to the votes you get. This means that if you have 1.1 optics, it will add 1.1x the amount of votes you would normally get.\r\n</li></ul><p>I own all of the visual and audio assets except for the fonts\u00a0Old Newspaper Types\u00a0and\u00a0Kitchen Sink, both of which are free to use with attribution.
