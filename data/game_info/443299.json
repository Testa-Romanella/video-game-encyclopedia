Join him on a quest to take revenge against the Magic Academy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Custodial Conundrum, you play as the Janitor, a long shunned inhabitant of the Magic Academy for gifted young wizards. Tired of being pushed around and ridiculed, he plots to take his revenge by stealing what is rightfully his, The Magic Artifact. Sneak, distract, and enchant your way through 4 distinct levels using a combination of environment interactions, magic spells, and the Janitor's trusty water bucket.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MY MAGIC NOW</strong> - The Janitor couldn't make tuition, but that doesn't mean he can't pick up knowledge. Steal a magic wand and learn the magic that has been kept from him for so long. He is going to need it to infiltrate the forbidden basement of the Academy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DECISIONS, DECISIONS </strong>- With environment pieces, spells, and the Janitor's trusty bucket, explore and discover ways to get past the distrustful professors of the Academy. Using your wits, you can complete puzzles the way YOU want to.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GET SNEAKY, NOT BLEAKY</strong>\u00a0- The stealth genre is riddled with games that have you committing acts of violence. Take a break from those dark and violent themes and enjoy a stealth game that's appropriate for more than just adults. As The Janitor, your progression through the Academy will involve cunning\u00a0pranks, not mindless murder.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Developed by Aisle 2 Games at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p>Aisle 2 Games is a game development team from The University of Texas at Austin's 3-D Game Capstone program.
