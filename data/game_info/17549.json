{"id": 17549, "slug": "monstrum", "name": "Monstrum", "name_original": "Monstrum", "description": "<p>Monstrum takes the traditional survival horror formula and remixes it completely with procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and AI driven predators, ensuring that nowhere on its derelict cargo ship is ever truly safe.<br />\nOffering up a challenge to even the hardiest of gamers, Monstrum will force you to use your wits and whatever tools you can find to outrun or outsmart your pursuer. Attempt to escape from an environment that is out to kill you while evading the lurking terror that could be around any corner. Can you survive Monstrum?<br />\nGame Features<br />\nThree Unique Monsters<br />\nFace one of three monster types each play-through, each one with different behaviours and tactics. Can you work your way out of an ambush or escape a direct attack? And will the same actions work every time?<br />\nProcedural Arena<br />\nPrepare for a different gameplay environment each time you play as the ship&#39;s interior shifts shape with every run, changing the location of items along the way.<br />\nEscape Routes<br />\nDiscover different methods of escape and delve into the bowels of the ship to recover items you need to repair them.<br />\nOpportunities and Hazards<br />\nUse whatever you can find to try and outwit the monster. Hide in lockers or under furniture. Use distractions to attract the monster to you, or, perhaps more wisely, to where you&#39;ve just been, but be careful not to run too fast lest you fall into one of the ships numerous traps along the way.<br />\nPermadeath<br />\nDeath is death. Get killed in Monstrum and you&#39;ll be starting again. In a different ship, probably against a different monster. Good luck. Start running.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-03T17:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca597031e8800b0333142c334dd95fa2.jpg", "website": "http://teamjunkfish.com/games/monstrum", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 545, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS"], "developers": ["Team Junkfish"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Soedesco", "Team Junkfish"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
