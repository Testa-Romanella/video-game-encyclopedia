Let us give you the rundown. Just be warned that there are spoilers ahead, so series newcomers should tread lightly!<br/><br/>This compilation contains the following three Muv-Luv adventures:<br/><br/><strong>Muv-Luv Alternative Chronicles: Adoration</strong><br/><br/>A novella-length spinoff title set in the world of \u201cThe Euro Front,\u201d which offers a rare glimpse into what the world of Muv-Luv Alternative is like outside of Japan.<br/><br/>When an uptight Japanese cadet gets stationed at a British military base during the final leg of his Royal Guard training, he thinks he\u2019s got it all figured out. But he soon discovers that there\u2019s more to being a surface pilot than sheer discipline when he\u2019s assigned to the Cerberus Battalion, an esteemed TSF corps full of elite but eccentric surface pilots. Alongside a trio of buxom babes whose frisky flirtations throw him off at every turn, he\u2019ll have to learn to loosen up and adapt to the unexpected in order to truly understand what it takes to be a soldier.<br/><br/><strong>Muv-Luv Alternative Chronicles: Resurrection</strong><br/><br/>One month prior to the events of Muv-Luv Alternative, a cybernetic soldier named Silvio Orlandi arrives at Yokohama Base to work security detail at an upcoming Alternative Program summit \u2014 though in truth, he\u2019s an undercover agent sent by the European Union for the express purpose of gathering classified intel about Alternative IV, as well as any other concerning projects the enigmatic Professor Kouzuki might have in the works.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, however, he quickly discovers that this won\u2019t be a simple recon mission, as the Professor\u2019s personal detachment \u2014 the Valkyrie Squadron \u2014 seems perpetually poised to distract him at every turn. And yet, their playful attitudes and suggestive antics seem to indicate that they have no real intention of obstructing his mission\u2026 but could it truly all be just a coincidence? Or is there more to this situation than meets the eye?<br/><br/><strong>Altered Fable: A Shimmering Shard of Spacetime</strong><br/><br/>The long-awaited follow-up to the original Muv-Luv saga is finally here! Picking up directly where Muv-Luv Alternative left off, Takeru returns to the wacky rom-com world of Muv-Luv Extra, only this time, things are more than a little bit different! The multiverse may have been mended, but now this Love Nucleus has even MORE girls to choose from! Let the harem hijinks begin!<br/><br/>Serving as a homecoming for the series in more ways than one, this \u201creimagined\u201d version of Extra  (often called \u201cFinal Extra\u201d) is the perfect bookend to Takeru\u2019s story. If you consider the trilogy as a multi-course meal, then this is the dessert \u2014 a sweet and scrumptious reward for powering through the daunting entr\u00e9e that is Muv-Luv Alternative. You\u2019ve swallowed every tough pill, every morsel of pain and despair that game could throw at you; now it\u2019s time for some well-deserved rest. Reconnect with all your favorite characters one last time in this massive, celebratory sendoff to one of the greatest casts in gaming history.<br/><br/>When we last left Takeru, he\u2019d just been introduced to his new classmates \u2014 the multimillionaire Meiya, her courtly sister Yuuhi, and the timid transfer student from overseas, Kasumi. Our story picks up with a class cook-off to determine who gets the privilege of sitting next to Takeru, but this is quickly overshadowed by a much more interesting reveal two days later.<br/><br/>It seems Kasumi won\u2019t be the only foreigner to grace the halls of Hakuryo Prep this year, as the school board has decided to participate in an all-new \u201cteacher exchange program,\u201d welcoming faculty members from all over the world in an effort to broaden students\u2019 horizons. And wouldn\u2019t you know it \u2014 these new temps all just so happen to be familiar faces we met back in Muv-Luv Alternative. Yes, even the Valkyries are here, as Hakuryo alums brought in by Yuuko to tip the scales during the school sports festival. All the characters you know and love are here in this rip-roaring redux \u2014 many of whom we never even met in the idyllic world of Muv-Luv Extra!<br/><br/>So you see, this isn\u2019t just a simple rehash of Extra. No, this is an all-new adventure with all-new friends and possibilities. This is Final Extra.<br/><br/>Join Takeru and the gang as they take part in all sorts of zany antics, from a school-wide airsoft tournament, to hitting the slopes at a mountain hot spring lodge, to getting caught up in an international conspiracy, to learning the true meaning of Christmas, to an all-expenses paid tropical island getaway \u2014 where Takeru might just have the chance to live out his wildest fantasies with the apple of his eye. Anything can happen in this new, rewritten reality \u2014 this Altered Fable \u2014 and it\u2019s your story to unfold.<h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li> Three massive adventures, all available in both English and Japanese!
