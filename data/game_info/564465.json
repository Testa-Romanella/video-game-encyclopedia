There are people out and about, yes, but they look scary. By collecting seeds and caring for them, you can make the town a bit more colorful. And suddenly your neighbors might seem a little bit more friendly, maybe even helpful.</p>\n<p>Can you find a way to gather all the red seeds and plant them in the town center?</p>\r\nHow to Play the Game\r\n<p>Move around by clicking. You can interact with seeds, planting spots, and water buckets or other water sources by clicking on them. Once an NPCs is ready to talk to you, you can initiate the dialogue by clicking on them.</p>\n<p>You will find special red seeds along the way, which you will need to win the game, but you won't be able to pick them up right away. You can get them after a bit of progression.</p>\r\nSpecial Credits\r\n<p>Special Credits got to the following people</p>\n<ul><li>Finalbossblues, for the Omega Modern Graphics Pack</li><li>Kenney, for countless asset packs used in this project\u00a0</li><li>@RLP091, for the suggestion of the name</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a60d2bf340b2c8705a37f33afedd905c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Selina"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
