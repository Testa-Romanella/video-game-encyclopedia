You remember nothing about yourself except your name and... that's pretty much it. On top of that, it's Valentine's Day, you've got an unlabeled box of chocolates sitting in your bag, and a few of your \"friends\" are here\u00a0to see you.\u00a0<em>What in the world happened? W</em><em>ho are you?\u00a0</em><em>Who are these guys?\u00a0</em>And more importantly...<em>\u00a0Who are these chocolates for?!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Froot Basket Valentine\u00a0</em>takes place in a sort of progressive Japanese high school. I tried my very best to write the protagonist without using any gender-specific pronouns to test my writing skills. I hope it gives you warm, fuzzy, shoujo manga feelings~! Just\u00a0don't get too comfortable with that vibe... All is not as it seems...\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING:</strong> Blood, Jump Scare, Teacher x Student Romance<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Custom name protagonist\r\n</li><li>7 Love Interests(?)\r\n</li><li>7 CGs\r\n</li><li>15 endings w/ ending gallery\r\n</li><li>~10-15 minutes of gameplay per route\r\n</li><li>Spoopy mystery(?)\r\n</li><li>Romance(?)\r\n</li><li>A healthy dose of fruits!\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Story and Art</strong>\u00a0| xxmissarichanxx\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Backgrounds |\u00a0</strong>mugenjohncel\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>\u00a0|\u00a0TAM Music Factory,\u00a0Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Fruit images do not belong to me.
