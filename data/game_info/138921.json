Thus, Dropped lacks saves to make it a more challenging experience. Dropped will also display your total deaths and play time when you complete a full run. Dropped was an experiment within five areas:</p>\n<ol><li>What is a game like with no horizontal collisions?</li><li>What can be achieved as a programmer doing pixel art?</li><li>Are single screen levels even fun anymore?</li><li>Can I make more fun levels?\u00a0 </li><li>Can I learn GameMaker Studio 1.4 in a day?</li></ol>\n<p>Note that this is a new release to itch, but I built it and released it on my personal website in late 2016.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Andrew Ajemian - Programmer, Game Designer, Pixel Artist<br/>\n</li><li>I need water by JD Zinda(Nuke Falling from the Sky) Licensed under the permission given to use license. </li><li>License: Attribution | Etheross</li>https://soundcloud.com/etheross/a-little-chiptune-cant-hurt<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Attribution 3.0 | Recorded by Mike Koenig </li>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n<br/>http://soundbible.com/1232-Water-Drop-Sound-High.html\r\n<br/>http://soundbible.com/1139-Water-Drop-Low.html <br/>http://soundbible.com/1126-Water-Drop.html<br/></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/383/383d7121a585c4ade38efe55cf0d6c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kotoran"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
