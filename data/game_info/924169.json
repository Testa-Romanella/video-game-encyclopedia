It\u2019s always the same way every time; a person confesses under the tree behind the school and then the next day they go missing. This peaks the interest of aspiring ghost hunter Timmy Curtain, a member of the Occult club, the only member of the Occult club. He believes it is the work of an angry revenant and Timmy will stop at nothing until he gets a picture of it. Follow Timmy in this weird and rooted mystery as he traverses the halls of an inverted B.S High with a \u00a320 toy camera and crowd of rabid wooden furniture out to kill him!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>A special thank you to the team creating the game, everyone worked super hard on the project, so it\u2019d be great if you could share this project to others and check out everyone's socials displayed below!
