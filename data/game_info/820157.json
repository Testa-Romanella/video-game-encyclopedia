Toss and throw your way to victory in this horde-based action game, and become the leader of your home turf!<br/></p>\n\r\nDICE AND SLICE\r\n<p>Use the <strong>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON</strong> to throw your dice towards the cursor, and it'll throw the dice its way! To retrieve it back to your position, use the<strong> RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON</strong>. You can damage enemies while the dice's in the air, either in a throw or while retrieving it!</p>\n<p>You can see which number the dice roll gets right before it starts spinning - this is your Attack Power. The higher the roll is, the more damage you deal to enemies - for example, if an oncoming <strong>Domino </strong>has a health of 3 <em>(notice the dots on its body!) </em>and your dice roll's a 2, the Domino will be left with 1 health on impact.</p>\n<p>The dice roll resets only when you throw the dice again, meaning the power's the same while you're retrieving! Pull off trick shots by throwing the dice first, then getting right behind your enemy and slicing them out. You'll get the hang of it as you play!<br/><br/></p>\r\nTHE MANUFACTURERS<br/><br/>\n<p><em>Made in 48 hours for the GMTK\u00a0Game Jam 2022.</em></p>\r\nProgramming, art<br/>HonieWebsite | TwitterMusic, sound effects<br/>Ezequiel PalladinoInstagram\r\n\r\nFACTORY DEFECTS\r\n<p>This game was made in an exceedingly short time span, and is very rough around the edges! Here's a list of the known bugs and glitches so far. Found a nasty one? Leave a comment below!</p>\r\nOnly six hordes have been coded, and there's no win condition. Once you've defeated all of the enemies, you're left to roam around alone.<br/>The music track doesn't loop correctly.<br/>Enemies can spawn on walls, or close to the Player.<br/>The dice doesn't take wall collisions into account, and may leave the play area.<br/>The Domino's legs may rotate incorrectly when looking to the right.<br/>The enemy hit sound effect won't play when an enemy is defeated.\r\n\n<p>\u203b <strong>Note:</strong> There's a <em>Post-jam Version</em> button on the in-game menu, which sends you to a different Itch.io page that will host a final build of the game, <strong>as soon as the voting period is over. </strong>While the voting period is active, there will not be any newer builds publically available, to abide with the GMTK Game Jam rules.
