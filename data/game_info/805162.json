Thought I\u00a0would upload as proof of concept anyways for feedback. I\u00a0wanted to do minigames like Wario but add a different twist on it by not using typical pixel graphics and coming up with unique themed puzzles.</p><p>https://liluo.io/instant-builds/96442fe2-d3c7-498d-9913-9bf266bc52ed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T13:17:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2aa0729549732dbc1f6894cd375cc57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Azurekhan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
