{"id": 570047, "slug": "tic-tricolour-illumination-conduits", "name": "TIC: Tricolour Illumination Conduits", "name_original": "TIC: Tricolour Illumination Conduits", "description": "<p>This is a very short puzzle game showing a new mechanic I developed based around covering a board with light cast out from a limited set of directional beams. It starts off very easy but some of the later levels can become kind of tricky.</p>\n<p><strong>TIC</strong> is the first game I've ever completed and for that reason alone I am already incredibly proud. Feedback is very appreciated however I already feel like I've spent too much time on this project so don't hold your breath for updates.</p>\n<p>I'm not confident that all of the puzzle potential has been achieved from this idea but at this point, I don't have the puzzle creation skills to make anything more complex. <br/></p>\n<p>There is a <strong>level editor</strong> though! If you take a stab at making any levels please copy your level codes and share them here in the comments. I would absolutely love to see what you can come up with!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for taking a look at my game, for even that simple act I'm already grateful. If you would like to see any of my future games, check a look at my <strong>twitter</strong> @bendolyne!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. When downloading the game to get it for <strong>free</strong>, please click the obnoxiously greyed out \"<strong>No thanks, just take me to the downloads</strong>\" button above the price box.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T08:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/948/9488bda10a91b5460fe9a5b7e0dd0875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bendolyne"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
