My name is Matei Bogdan (a.k.a HalfOrange), I'm an 18 years old male developer(wanna be) from Romania. A friend told me about Unity and I thought of giving it a shot. I started working in Unity(and in C#) 5 days ago, and managed  to develop a game based on the first tutorial on Unity Learn section (Roll-A-Ball). I have long ways to go but I hope you'll enjoy my short game(it was one of the most exciting this I ever did and for sure will continue creating/developing).</p><p>Please give me your feedback on my first game(critics are most welcome)!</p><p>Until the next game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04cfb4e78aeabfb5c7c3d7784a73ab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["HalfOrange"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
