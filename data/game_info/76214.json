The closer and faster you fly to the cliff the more points you score, and the more points you score the more levels and wingsuits you unlock! There are 6 different mountains to explore and conquer, with 13 distinct courses to master.<br/><br/>The Proximity Project uses a very sophisticated physics engine to deliver the most realistic flight possible - THIS IS NOT AN EASY GAME!!! If you're looking for something easy, I suggest Angry Birds - if you're looking for a game that challenges you and rewards your efforts - The Proximity Project IS IT!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T20:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8f0e0852fd996f667e261e51c0f2a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Autonoma"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Zach Smith"], "esrb_rating": null}
