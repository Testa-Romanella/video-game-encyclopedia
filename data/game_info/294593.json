We created a game in which you can run multiple clients that all communicate with each other though a central server. You can connect with all your friends over your local IP and play together (Here is how to find your local IP).\u00a0 You can also open port 7777 on your router and host it over wifi.\u00a0This is our first time working with unity's LLAPI.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Zytion (Bobby) Levin</p>\n<p>Skyler Zartman (https://skyler-zartman.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Caden Messenger (https://cadenmessenger.itch.io)</p><p>Find our game on the Global Game Jam site here:\u00a0</p><p>https://devpost.com/software/server-ducks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:35:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/42996379d48528c28d716715d17398b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bobby Levin", "Skyler Zartman", "CadenMessenger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
