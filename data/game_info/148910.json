The theme is 'cosmos' and the optional theme 'peculiar loot' inspired the star absorbing mechanic. I didn't have a lot of time to work on this, but I've only done 1 game jam before this one, so I thought I might just make a small, simple game for this. Accretion is a game where you play as a black hole, you must absorb the stars until you are big enough to absorb the other black hole chasing you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/84256742fbae42742d8bc7386d273656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Rob Glen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
