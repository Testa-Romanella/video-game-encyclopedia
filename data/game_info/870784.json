Except you didn\u2019t count on all these pesky Lanternflys everywhere. And to top it off\u2026 rents are soaring at an astronomical rate. The evil landlords are taking advantage of the turmoil and laughing at you for agreeing to paying their villainous rent fees.</p>\n<p>Armed with vinegar, your goal is to stop as many Lanternflys as you can in hopes of making the city cleaner and decreasing your rent. Watch out for the lanternfly honeydew which will try to stop you.
