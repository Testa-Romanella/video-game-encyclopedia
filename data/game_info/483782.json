In the future I\u2019ll be implementing VR support (hopefully within the next few months!), but for now remains a flat game.</p>\n<p>This game is set in a universe I\u2019ve been designing this past summer on one of the \u2018Nine\u2019, a group of\u00a0agricultural planets on the edge of human-controlled space 200 years in the future, just after first contact with an unknown\u00a0alien threat. Assume control of Alpha squad during their last moments and defend against wave after wave of alien adversaries.</p>\n<p>This game is still in a very early pre-alpha (heck, it\u2019s just a single scene with two enemy types) and it will be improving a lot over the course of development.
