They try to steer away from danger but they lack the intuition and overview that you can provide. Help them survive as long as possible!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>A / D or Left/Right:\u00a0</strong>nudge svarm left/right</li><li><strong>Space:\u00a0</strong>activate powerup to crush buildings in your way</li><li><strong>R:\u00a0</strong>Restart game</li><li><strong>Esc</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>Quit game</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You get score for distance travelled, multiplied by currently alive flatsvermers. Fly close to yellow flatsvermers to invite them into your swarm. Orange buildings can be carefully flown over when the flatsvermers are high up in the air.</p>\n<p>You get powerups by flying close to the large blue triangles, you can have a maximum of 3 and your current amount is shown as a meter on the top of the screen. Use these sparingly as they get really hard to pick up as the building density increases and that's when you really need them!</p>\r\nRelease\r\n<p>It has been exported and tested for Windows 10. There is a Linux x64 build as well, but it was not tested due to deadline.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb4/cb497a8a4ee5ae965bdf085d06a9fbec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["fredspipa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
