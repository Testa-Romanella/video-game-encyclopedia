Be a Better Bank", "description": "<p>Bankk is a game that gives you the opportunity to run your own virtual bank. </p><p>Meet with new customers and investors each month, approving or declining the offers they may bring to you. Then take a vacation and see what the next month has in store. <br/><br/>Grow your business by working with healthy customers and avoiding those who are likely to default on their loans and take from your company. Also, put together a solid portfolio of investors who can support your business without taking too much for themselves. <br/><br/>Check the in-game help menu for more detail. <br/><br/>To play, first download and extract the zip file from Google Drive, and then open the file 'bankk.html' with your web browser. <br/><br/>Should work on any device that can open HTML files in a fairly modern browser. Goal for this project was to build a game that could be deployed to Firefox OS. <br/><br/>This game was built using Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers and may not work correctly on other platforms. Thank you for any feedback or suggestions you may have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96dd0b191b2b84f2bbc2f26cd4175abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ptkfs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
