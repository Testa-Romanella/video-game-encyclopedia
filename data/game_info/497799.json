As resources get more sparse competition grows more hostile. The two remaining factions Voidbridge Cooperation and Blackhole Alliance are in an ongoing war for the remaining asteroid fields. Smaller conflicts are usually resolved by sending in a mothership and letting automated drones deal with it, but when both parties send in their motherships, drones are met with drones and the conflict goes nowhere. In these rare instances mercenaries get hired to take over drones and modify them into capable fighters.</p>\n<p>In Drone\u00a0Control you are such a mercenary taking over drones to take out the enemy mothership. Only drones can deal enough damage to bring one down, so you need to get your own drones near enough so they can attack it. The other faction will try to do the same!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8d73935d5d257fc066b780446462761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RobertBleyl"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
