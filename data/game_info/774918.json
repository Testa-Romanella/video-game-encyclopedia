No matter which one would win, they both left with no thought to the people or the lands they destroyed. <br/>The last time they fought, a group of heroes was able to get their attention and convince them to change their fight. They talked the dragons into letting the people decide who wins their fight. A tower was built and whosoever makes it to the top of the tower would declare the winner. Will you take on that responsibility? <br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to the adventuring life.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T06:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31a9f6d40fb0780c576287011895abab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kraege"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
