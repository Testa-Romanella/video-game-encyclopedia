All the animations you see are hand-drawn frame by frame. We hope that this little game can offer you a\u00a0<strong>short yet pleasant experience</strong>, something that anyone can pick up and put in their library. This game is a love letter to retro gaming, reminiscent of GBA games. We hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/></p>\r\nChallenge Yourself!\r\n<p>Track your score and compete with others. Race your friends to see who can clean the river faster. Earn achievements by not getting hit or taking any hearts. We\u2019ll even give you a special achievement for beating the dev\u2019s score!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nFollow Us!\r\n<p><strong>Andrew\u00a0</strong>Game Designer/Developer<br/>https://twitter.com/zizhen96</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDzwekJq1TTUIOSBI0wHNrw<br/><br/><strong>Giacomo\u00a0</strong>Artist/Animator/Designer<br/>https://www.instagram.com/ginkovonagrum/<br/><br/><strong>Tomer</strong>\u00a0Sound Designer/SoundMaster<br/>https://twitter.com/TomerAudio<br/><br/><strong>ActEsper\u00a0</strong>Composer<br/>https://www.youtube.com/user/ActBlader<br/><br/><strong>Sebastian\u00a0</strong>Additional Sound Designer<br/>https://www.facebook.com/watch/sorrelltheband/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72c74503b84e6959da7f626ae78ae511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrei Zi Zhen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
