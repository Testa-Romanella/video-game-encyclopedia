Quickly after, he realizes that the situation is not in his favor as he has to learn how to deal with some entities that do not appear to be the most friendly in nature. Fast reflexes and attention to detail may help him escape this new dilemma.</p>\n<p>Smile touches on some topics that include mental health and addiction. Therefore if you are sensitive to these topics, then please proceed with caution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smile is being created solely by 1 person. From game design and development, all the way thru to publishing on itch.io and hopefully Steam once it is completed. So if you did enjoy the experience, please consider leaving a donation on this itch.io page. It would greatly help the developer improve the quality of the game and show your support for the project!</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise \u2026 Keep On Smiling!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T03:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af8fa65cd1ed4f88f6a96ffc9a82682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecco Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
