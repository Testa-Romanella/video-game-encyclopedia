The final game will include more levels, more sound effects, the actual threat of the game (The Minotaur), and a special card type that teleports you 2 spaces in any direction!</p>\n<p>But that's for later because I'm out of time right now.</p><p>Play using the arrow keys and the A, S, Z, &amp; X keys, and use the \"Help\" screen from the main game menu\u00a0to learn how to play.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>The cover art chosen is Labyrinth Deck by\u00a0Nat Morillo</p><p>I'll try to figure out how to get Itchio to let me give you the TIC-80 cartridge image with the source code as soon as I can, but for now it's just giving me trouble.
