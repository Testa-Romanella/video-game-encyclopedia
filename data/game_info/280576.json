My last name <em>Lobo</em> translates to \"Wolf\" in Spanish. The player plays as a Mexican Wolf, a species that belongs to the Gray wolf family and also one of the most enangered wolves in all of North America. I hoped to inspire and educate some people of the perils the Mexican Wolf faces as a consequence of trapping and hunting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/135a5859b00dcae0e6322be2d4278261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["evitalobo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
