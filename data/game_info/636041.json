I come to Warioware Inc for the chance to test out new microgames. Recently, I've heard about Warioware Microgame Championship. I've played every microgame in the warioware collection and have trained myself to become the best warioware gamer. I'm all set to participate, but there's a problem. The championship is at my bedtime. Fortunately I snuck my Warioware game console into my room. Unfortunately, my mother knows and is now trying to kill me. I'm counting on you to save me from certain game over by hiding from my mother.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T07:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc0b5f300afdb4c2eaff1b5fe12c17d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rainbow-Vision"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
