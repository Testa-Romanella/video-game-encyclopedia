{"id": 972450, "slug": "flyout-2", "name": "Flyout", "name_original": "Flyout", "description": "Flyout is an aircraft building game with an emphasis on design freedom and realistic physics, sound and effects. Use the in-game modeling tools to create an aircraft of any shape, add and configure engines for your needs, set up control surfaces and take your design on a test flight around an earth-sized procedurally generated planet.<h3>Editor Tools</h3><br/><strong>-freeform fuselage editor<br/>-wing editor<br/>-material and texture settings<br/>-paint tools and import of custom decals<br/>-configurable turbines, ramjets, piston engines and electric motors<br/>-configurable propellers and rotors that can be connected to any engine(s) via gearbox<br/>-configurable landing gear<br/>-configurable control surface and joint inputs <br/>-fly-by-wire settings<br/>-basic cockpit interior parts<br/>-import reference images to create replicas<br/>-modding support that currently allows import of .obj models and textures</strong><h3>Simulation</h3><strong>-wing shape, span and sweep have a large effect on flight behavior<br/>-fuselage drag is calculated from shape<br/>-engine simulation <br/>-aircraft sounds change with design<br/>-realistic atmosphere model<br/>-wind, turbulence, vertical draft<br/>-ground effect</strong><h3>BEFORE YOU BUY:</h3>This game is not easy. There are no in-game tutorials and tool tips are limited due to Early Access status. <br/>Fuselage editing is similar to modeling in any 3D software, although much simplified.<br/>There will be bugs due to the highly unrestricted editor and Early Access status of the game.<br/>Basic understanding of aircraft physics and flight controls is required or at least recommended.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T13:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee93371e46ebfe5b042d4d7494ac879.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stonext Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stonext Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
