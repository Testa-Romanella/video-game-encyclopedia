Development was done in collaboration with the Ohio University Game Developers Association and developed by Emelia Douglas, Zach Yeauger, Matt Skidmore, Eddie Collins, and Myself, Andrew Decker.</p><p>This game wasn't really developed with HTML5, I just know some people don't like downloads, so I built it to this too. Because of this, I recommend downloading the game and playing it with a controller to get the experience we wanted to deliver. I can't quite get the menu to display correctly in the HTML5 version. Works great on Mac and Windows though!</p><p>Check out my website for more information on the game:<br/>http://www.andrewdeckergamedev.com/the-seeds-of-fr...</p><p>Controls:</p>Movement - WASD Keys / Gamepad Left Analog Stick<p>Melee - Left Click / X Button (Xbox controller) / Square Button (PlayStation Controller)</p><p>Ranged - Right Click / Y Button (Xbox Controller) / Triangle Button (PlayStation Controller)</p><p>Feel free to report any bugs in the comments below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb9d91ec129ae54df46e8207134469a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["AndrewDecker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
