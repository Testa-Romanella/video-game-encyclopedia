Just wanted to immortalize it by submitting it here. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 'Chari' - directly translated from the Nepali language , means Bird/Birdie. This game follows you, the main character,\u00a0Chari on your journey as you soar through the sky avoiding the buildings. But you soon realize the gap between the buildings get narrower with time. Since the gaps get to a point where even your tiny body cannot fit through, you start to panic and as you hit a building and vanish from existence, you realize you never had any goals to achieve and were flying endlessly.\u00a0So Yeah, basically a FlappyBird clone. It's my first game,\u00a0 what did you expect?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Enjoy and explore the sky as 'Chari'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/436083f3453ce48a2f42e32c30c5589a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Kritan Thakali"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
