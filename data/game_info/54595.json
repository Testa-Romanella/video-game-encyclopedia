It is a direct descendant of the original Asteroids, with asteroids replaced by colorful geometric shapes like cubes, diamonds, and spinning pinwheels. Space Duel is the first and only multi-player vector game by Atari. When Asteroids Deluxe did not sell well, this game was taken off the shelf and released to moderate success. There were no contemporary home ports.</p>\n<p>The player has five buttons: two to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for force field. Shooting all objects on the screen completes a level. Space Duel, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Gravitar all used similar 5-button controlling system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08da441fa19e566eb4492a5d095e9ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari 7800", "Atari Flashback"], "developers": ["Atari"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
