In this case we are dealing with mix of realities, blending them together!<br/><br/>Because I love procedural generation I've been thinking about creating small, logical puzzle experience, unique mechanics and satisfying gameplay. It's up to you if I managed to do it during November Game Jam! <br/>Main challenge - very performant runtime mesh generation algorithm.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Dimensional Lift is a Puzzle / Adventure game where you mix realities -\u00a0 a real world and a parallel world. This hybrid of two worlds leads to clever solutions!<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>In the game you are controlling main protagonist Barbarian in Third Person mode who has only two skills - parallel swing and normal interact / attack action.<br/>Our hero is capable of affecting world around him.<br/>Whole experience is divided on 14 missions where your brain will be challenged.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>In reality I mainly focus on presenting all game mechanics and not combining them enough. With people encouragement and support I am sure I will add more unique / clever puzzles combining all existing mechanics and creating new as well!<br/><br/>Share your thoughts on discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/SQ6JEkQ<br/>Check my website: http://tefeldev.com/<br/>and YouTube:\u00a0 http://youtube.com/UnrealTefel<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94d7ea3b7c60edb5c8ca8e595974758b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tefel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
