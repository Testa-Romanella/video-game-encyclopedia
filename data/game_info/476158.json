Get together with friends and run your very own racing track, or join an existing one within the vibrant Dirt Rallycross community.<br/><br/>Getting used to Dirt Rallycross<br/><br/>The first time you play Dirt Rallycross may be a little daunting. Not many drivers finish their first race without a crash, and even fewer will win their first event. The game is designed from the ground up to be an authentic simulation of real world rally. The good news for you is, real world driving techniques are applicable to every section of every stage in the game.<br/><br/>A better understanding of rally driving techniques will lead you to become naturally faster as you gain confidence and understanding of the car you are driving and the surfaces that you are driving on. It is much easier to add speed to a good technique.<br/><br/>Attitude!<br/><br/>Like an aeroplane, rally cars move in 3 axis; roll (side to side), pitch (front to back) and yaw (rotation). In order to traverse a rally stage quickly and without crashing, the driver must pro-actively manage the attitude of the car at all times. Rally cars are well known for performing big slides and most of the time, they are intentionally induced by the driver to achieve as high a speed as possible without sliding off the road.<br/><br/>Braking;<br/><br/>There are two separate but equally important uses for the brakes in a rally car. The most obvious use is to slow down to a speed at which the car can take the next corner without crashing. The second, less obvious reason is to manage weight transfer before, during or even after cornering. Applying the brakes transfers more of the weight of the car over the front wheels, pressing the tyres against the road, giving them increased grip. Of course, the trade off is that the rear tyres have less of the cars weight applied to them, resulting in less grip.<br/><br/>Weight Transfer;<br/><br/>The key component around which most other aspects of rally driving revolve is known as 'weight transfer'. The direct effect of weight transfer is that the amount of mechanical pressure applied by each of the four tyres against the road surface varies. When a car speeds up, slows down or turns, each tyre will experience an increase or decrease in that mechanical pressure compared to when the car is stationary. This results in an increase or decrease of the potential grip available. As a driver you must actively manage the weight transfer in order to maximise the grip potential of each tyre, at the moment that grip is required whether you are braking, accelerating or turning. Braking and accelerating produces longitudinal weight transfer. Turning produces lateral weight transfer. Bear this basic principle in mind when you\u2019re out on stage, as almost all techniques are used to manage weight transfer.<br/><br/>Race on the REAL WORLD TRACKS including Nurburgring, Catalunya, Loheac, Portugal, Sweden.<br/><br/>Download Dirt Rallycross and join our community.<br/><br/>Have Fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T02:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64449ce70ffc835c80db5b7703c3691_p6Y1O9V.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/zgamesstudio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Serdar Akgul"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Serdar Akgul"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
