Select 4 heroes as well as spells and items for them and 6 towers as your arsenal to conquer a level. Unlock various hero classes, towers, spells, and items to choose from. Beat the game on normal to unlock hard with its own unique unlockables. Then beat hard to unlock legendary with even more unlockables exclusive to it. Make your own endless level in the level editor and see how long you can survive.</p>\n<p>This game is in beta and the price hasn't been finalized, but you can try the beta demo. Please let me know what you think either here or preferably on the forums of my website nostalgiaforge.com so that I may make changes, balance, and fix bugs before release.</p><p>Just a heads up, once the game is released and possibly as I release new demo versions progress will most likely be cleared. <br/></p><p>At this time the demo is desktop only, If you are a mac or linux user and want to try it then contact me and I can try to see if I can get something working.</p><p>The demo includes the story mode with 21/30 levels on normal (other difficulties are locked). I may add more features to the demo as I complete them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbe/bbe8799fd452cc36366b350ee4460872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NostalgiaForge"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
