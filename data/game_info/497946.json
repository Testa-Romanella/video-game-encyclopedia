After 9 days of working on this project I have a prototype demo and I am kind of sick of working on it. So right now I am taking a break from the project, and might never return to it. I would love to hear some feedback though, even if it's a simple \"fun\" or \"not fun\". Lay it on me.</p>\n<p>THE VISION is a game where you pilot a mech around a junkyard, destroy garbage in the appropriate way while avoiding releasing toxic into the air, and completing challenges to release animals. There is only one challenge and one animal in the game currently, but the infrastructure is in place to add more easily and quickly. In case anyone is interested to see what I planned and haven't implemented -\u00a0https://prnt.sc/ukhesp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae8/ae830644360fe3a02ecceb47e42a5523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueBallsTime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
