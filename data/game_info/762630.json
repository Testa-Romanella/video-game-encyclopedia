Then I mapped the mesh-points to the physical skeleton using some black-magic (math). The end result is a Verlet-like springy-jello effect that can be applied to any Sprite object.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>Unlike real Verlet there are no physical \"Sticks\" attached between the points. This means that objects can still make their way in-between the points and \"inside\" the sprite if narrow enough. It also makes him pretty prone to \"breaking\".</p>\n<p>Source file is available to look at but beware: I HAD to use a snippet of\u00a0Javascript since I couldn't figure out how to reference two instances\u00a0of the same object type and apply a Physics.DistanceJoint between them.\u00a0<br/><br/>Anyway have fun and let me know if it helps or you made something cool with it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T17:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65e6d3b235865b0a348ca3b8aa76b6cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NateOfThan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
