Since he can\u2019t afford the last generation eyes he always dreamt of, so he will head to his last resort, Chernobyl\u2019s Black Market, where he buys a pair of eyes, apparently in perfect condition. But in the 2043\u2019s Russia things aren\u2019t that easy and mafias are still running. He bought a prototype of eyes stolen from one of the biggest eyes manufacturers company and now he is trapped in some of the calibration routines included inside the pair of eyes. Since they are a prototype some strange behaviours start showing and the resolution of his eyes start going mad.</p>\n<p>Sacrifice your screen resolution to add pixels on objects in order to complete calibration chambers!
