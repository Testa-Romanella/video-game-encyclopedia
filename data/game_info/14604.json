{"id": 14604, "slug": "pyramid-raid", "name": "Pyramid Raid", "name_original": "Pyramid Raid", "description": "Pyramid Raid offers a unique mix of platforming and tower defense elements. You take control of a former Egyptian merchant turned mummy and try to survive pyramids built by other players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou were a sly, wealthy merchant in ancient Egypt and you still want to be one, even though you\u2019ve joined the ranks of the undead. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo do this, you have to raid and amass treasures from other Pyramids. Of course, the Pyramids won\u2019t just simply give their riches to you. You have to overcome all sorts of devious traps and avoid dying to get through the pyramid and steal the treasures. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe put a high emphasis on speed and timing. It\u2019s as much about finding the fastest way to clear the level as it is about clearing the level at all. The level building part, however, gives you an easy-to-use editor, one that allows you to create exactly the level you want to create. And if you do a good job and other players enjoy your level, you get even more treasures for it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2def512d7f83ad34996d5628feaff1.jpg", "website": "http://www.pyramid-raid.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 74, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Travian Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Travian Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
