Who knows where you will start your journey. Maybe it will be a cold and empty tundra or a fertile and impassable jungle?<br/><br/>Units capture cells and expand your empire, but be careful: the extended power is easier to crush into smaller ones! Units do not have health, but there is a force parameter. A strong unit can destroy a weaker unit. So hold back the onslaught of the numerous, but weak army of your enemy.<br/><br/>Recruit and upgrade units, build buildings and raise your economy.
