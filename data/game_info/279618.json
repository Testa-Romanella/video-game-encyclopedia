During a test, the system glitches. She's stuck in a world of her own making, she only wishes she'd done a better job organizing her world. Running through fractured levels to collect the keys to unlock the password to escape, Agein must  survive, fund clues to the password to escape, run, and come to understand how the A.I. she left in charge of the world understands reality.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is an experimental constructivist survival game. At the moment, I am releasing the first five levels, to get feedback on the system. I have always been motivated by the philosophy of optimistic nihilism (i.e., if everything is meaningless, choose whatever you want to be do and be), and have created this game to explore some of those thoughts through a visual, mechanism space. As such, its a bit of a work of art, a bit of a game, and bit of musing on the nature of our reality. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs I am releasing as early access, I am looking for feedback of what you want more of, what's not working, and reviews of what people think of the ideas being mulled over here.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/99093fb1d3027da79f12ebd5fe62132d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kit Martin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anthopper Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
