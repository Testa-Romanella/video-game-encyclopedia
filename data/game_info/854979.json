This isn't really a true walkthrough since there's no one linear path to follow.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The dad will tell you different dad jokes if you talk to him while holding different items.</li><li>There is a skeleton key buried in the dirt next to your house. You can use it to enter the graveyard.</li><li>There is a bird near the entrance of the community. Showing it a chicken leg has a funny interaction. You can interact with a shovel to scare it off to the playground. Interact with the shovel again to scare it into the forest. Find it in the forest for funny dialogue.</li><li>If you give the large person blocking the store a chicken leg, you can push them around, or swing the shovel at them for a big push.</li><li>After you dig holes for flowers with the shovel on the opposite side of the pathway to your house, you can go back to your bed and sleep. On the next day, if you give the digging trench lady the shovel, you can sleep again to get a visit from the mask man. Return to the trench to find the amount of digging she accomplished.</li><li>After giving the digging lady the shovel, you can take her spoon and use it on the gear to cross the bridge leading to the forest and the graveyard.<br/>\n</li><li>Losing the tic-tac-toe game on the playground will give you the phrase you need to open the vault. (YOUAREDED)</li><li>You can escape the community and jump over the wall from the top of the opened vault door, this will result in a visit from the mask man though. Getting on top of the walls can get you past the trench and keep your shovel.</li><li>The minecart and snow mountain screenshots are levels that didn't make it into the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I got to the vault/graveyard/deeptrench and I can see under the level and there's nothing to do?</li></ul>\n<p>Yep, that's all there is, the game is incomplete and likely will never be finished.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T10:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f8a637cc7b40529d9b9a7b60dd9551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nickburner"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
