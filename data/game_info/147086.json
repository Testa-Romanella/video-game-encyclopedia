I suppose it could be called a \"falling asleep simulator,\" if you wanted to be cheeky about it.</p><p>I suggest that you play with headphones, since it is mainly an aural experience. I also suggest that you play using a gamepad, if available.</p><p>The Unity Web Player version has lower-quality audio; the downloads contain uncompressed .wav files.</p><p>NOTE: Don't fret, the black screen is not a bug. This was largely an exercise in sound and minimal gameplay/visual representation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e5/4e51a8761ddd24a7dd29f6973d5e0c91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["[bracket]games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
