The only way is to get the right plastic surgery to achieve the pinnacle of beauty. But plastic surgery takes significant coinage \u2013 not to mention you need to pay rent every turn. You\u2019ll need to do jobs to make money on your way to ultimate beauty. After surgeries, you may need some time to heal. Going to events with friends is a great way to relax. Holding the space bar will show you the number of turns each part of your face needs to heal completely (if any). Higher end jobs won\u2019t want a face too fresh out of surgery! Every so often, Most Beautiful Woman of the Year award will be given and you may be able to claim victory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de30fb67090c64ecfea8bb01d1dae43e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["comatomatoes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
