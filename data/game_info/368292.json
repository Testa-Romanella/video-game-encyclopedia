Go back to the beginning and start all over.<br/><br/>The movement of the pieces, and all the described rules are automatically <br/>managed by the application. Players only have to hit the \"Roll dice\" button at their turn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T03:35:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2dbc74678fd5bae10b7728da3ab630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
