All we know is that they are a secret organization that keeps things in the shadows, never to be seen, never to touch the surface of the earth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You were surfing the deep dark web for the fun of it, just to entertain yourself and see what\u2019s up, until you receive a notification.

You safely got in the destination. The people inside the vehicle inform you that they have taken you to Area 51. Things proceed from here.<br/></p>\n<p>You are given a project. You will be a test subject for their \u201centities\u201d that they contain inside the organization. You will be tested with your scavenging and detective skills. The entity that you will be experimented on is an entire location. Two locations specifically.
