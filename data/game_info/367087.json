Ned Ryerson! Remember me? I\u2019m sure glad as heckfire you\u2019re back in Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day! Ever since your dad passed away, it just hasn\u2019t been the same around here. But don\u2019t worry, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I\u2019ll show you the way, but watch that first step - it\u2019s a doozy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere in Punxsutawney you can:<br/>\r\n-Start each new day with the sweet sounds of your alarm clock, because with the right tune there ain\u2019t no hill or mountain we can\u2019t climb!<br/>\r\n-Reconnect with your family and friends!<br/>\r\n-Play different puzzles as you navigate through a branching narrative and try to win over Punxsutawney\u2019s citizens, because life isn\u2019t always a perfect Hollywood movie. Am I right or am I right?<br/>\r\n-Laugh, then cry, as you contemplate the cyclical nature of the human experience. And maybe, just maybe, escape your father\u2019s shadow and finally learn to appreciate your family and friends. Bing!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo why don\u2019t you stay here a while?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/83179f8ec7880afe35c88921458c72d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 50, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Tequila Works"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
