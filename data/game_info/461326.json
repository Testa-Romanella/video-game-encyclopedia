He asked for some help fixing and improving the game, so I fixed most of the bugs, implemented the power-ups, wave system, enemies, etc.</p>\n<p>The game also is a bit of copyright-infringement due to the JPEGs of Ganondorf\u00a0 and the environment that's used and music that's ripped, but I don't think anyone really cares for this silly, inoffensive high school student game.</p>\n<p>To play, just\u00a0<strong>use your mouse\u00a0</strong>to point-and-shoot. Survive for as long as possible. Use the power-ups, Luke.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f77/f77f406c2a99837f3890559fcd7f6f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
