{"id": 225790, "slug": "sprite-high", "name": "Sprite High", "name_original": "Sprite High", "description": "<p><strong>What is this?<br/></strong>Sprite High is a short visual novel prototype made from scratch in the Unity game engine. It has an estimated playtime of ~15 minutes, if going for all achievements.</p>\n<p><strong>Cool, but why in Unity?<br/></strong>I like building and expanding on systems of my own, rather than having to learn someone else\u2019s. The best way to escape a game engine's default template is to make your own!</p>\n<p><strong>Will you release the system for others to use?<br/></strong>Maybe one day, but for now it\u2019s still too rough and unpolished. If I was to release something it had to be crystal clear how the system worked to an external user, and the workflow needs to be made more\u00a0intuitive.</p>\n<p><strong>So, what\u2019s Sprite High about?<br/></strong>I don\u2019t want to \u201cspoil\u201d too much of the story, but I can say that I took a very light-hearted and self-aware approach to the writing. It's about someone who gets trapped inside a visual novel, but all the characters are aware of the fact that it's a simulation.\u00a0It's my way of writing a fun, quick story to test the mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>Any NSFW content?<br/></strong>The demo doesn\u2019t cover any overly mature themes, so it should be suitable for most viewers. Some minor innuendo and existential dread may be encountered though.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it save my progress?<br/></strong>Yes. All achievements and cleared scenes are saved locally on your computer, as well as the game\u2019s adjustable settings. However, it does not feature a traditional save slot feature.</p>\n<p><strong>It doesn\u2019t have that iconic save/load feature?<br/></strong>I have omitted this feature in the current version, and rather made the scenes short and sweet, with a scene select that becomes available after clearing a scene. The way I handle setting up scenes lends itself to fast iteration, but not necessarily easy saving. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to work more on in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>There are some nice assets in this, where are they from?<br/></strong>I decided to use some wonderful premade sprites found here on Itch in the demo. A full list to all the artists who contributed art, fonts and music is found here:\u00a0http://bit.ly/SpriteHighCredits</p>\n<p><strong>What are the controls?<br/></strong>A full list of the controls are found in-game. The most important key is the left CTRL key, which is used to enter skip-mode. Good for replaying and checking out different endings after an initial playthrough.</p>\n<p><strong>I can\u2019t find my resolution on the dropdown list!<br/></strong>The game only supports 16:9 or 16:10 resolutions. Other resolutions would cut off characters on the side of the screen. I apologize if that causes any inconveniences!</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to check out this little project among the sea of great visual novels on this site!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f8cc828679a31448dba372aad181d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoicesFromTheDark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
