Move the red dot through the dots</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>'Green' as 'Start'</em></p>\n\n<p><em>'Red' as 'End'</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<strong>YOU</strong>\n\n<p>The main character is... a Dot. Better to say, it is a red dot. Why red? Random.</p>\n<p>You can navigate through the game board with Red Dot using your keyboard (WASD or arrows) or with your Joystick (D-Pad or Left Stick).</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>DOTS</strong>\n<p>There are many elements, dots, with specific characteristics</p>\n<p>- <em><strong>Common dot</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>You can walk on it, it doesn't do anything special;</p>\n\n<p>-<em> <strong>Spiral Dot</strong></em>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It is a teleporter: if touched it randomly teleports you in a dot of the game board. Pay attention to dangerous dot...</p>\n\n<p>- <em><strong>Rainbow Dot</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>It is the good one: it's a point-dot and it gives you points without any negative consequences;</p>\n\n<p>- <em><strong>ReDo Dot</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>Do you want changes? Touch it! It's a particular dot, it makes your game board brand new;</p>\n\n<p>- <em><strong>Bomb Dot\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>It's a totally negative dot. It directly brings you to the game over;</p>\n\n<p>-<em> <strong>Electric Dot</strong></em><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's a negative dot. It doesn't makes you lose, but it subtract points... A lot of points...</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>THE PURPOSE</strong>\n<p>\u00a0The purpose is to reach the end how many times you can, but you will need to\u00a0find the amount of points required.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Don't worry, some dots can give you points, so go on them through the game board.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>MODALITIES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are tree modalities:</p>\n<p>- the easy one</p>\n<p>- the not easy (medium) one</p>\n<p>- the hard one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0What changes is the amount of special dots. But it's random, so hope to be lucky!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Go now through the game board, collect points and avoid dangerous dots!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SCREENSHOTS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Dot is available freely for windows 64-bit PCs</strong>.] </p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/086d032fac476a856c58422b991fd9ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gattoblu123"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
