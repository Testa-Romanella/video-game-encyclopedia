Whaaa??? A dream Ogar???\u00a0</p>\n<p>Based on the parable of self forgiveness, a man constantly has a dream of being chased by an ogar.... so he goes to a monk and ask... Monk, there is an ogar always chasing me in my dreams!! And I don't know why.... to which the monk replied, \"Next you are running from the ogar, stop, turn around and ask him why he is chasing you...\"</p>\n<p>Next night, our dream ogar is there... the man stops and turn to ask why the ogar is chasing him. The ogar replies... \"I dunno, its ur dream!\" This revelation to them man leads him to impart our ogar a gift... A glowing ball of light that surrounds our ogar, giving him the abilities to impart love and forgiveness to others....</p>\n<p>Soon, our ogar finds his own dream world under attack... an evil force of static noise, anxiety and depression looming over the land. Now our powers have a use! As the light passes into these noisy creatures, music fills the air and lights eliminates the dark creatures.... but they won't stop coming...</p>\n<p>Use your towers to last against the horde... Some require just your time, other bullets or points... Be aware tho once started, towers run until empty, unable to refill till they do. Each time it takes longer, cost more and last less... <br/></p>\n<p>\"Bosses\" appear every third way, getting increasingly stronger each appearance...</p>\n<p>There is no end to the prototype... its play till your die. No saves, check points or loads. Hope you enjoy and let me know how it runs!!</p>\n<p>Computer Controls - wasd or arrows for movement, J for main, K for defense and L secondary.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:51:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa5/aa5d7df73af750b69756c1c613e298e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["JahDesigned"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
