When this master race of parasites arrives to the planet of a relatively pacific planet of armadillos, they hunt down their inhabitants to harvest their body parts and to terraform. A small, but powerful armadillo will stand against the ever-growing shadow of this evil will manage to escape and regain control of his home planet.</p>\n<p>You play as the space-faring armadillo and his virtual partner navigating zero-gravity. You\u2019ll use your enormous blaster to propel yourself through abandoned space labs, deep space and the scorched soil of the planet you once called home; dispatching strange enemies on a surreal adventure through space.</p>\n<p>Propelling yourself through zero-g with a giant gun, bouncing off walls, and blasting enemies are what we hope will be fun. The purpose of the game is to escape the ship you are trapped on and find a way home, eliminating your foes and solving puzzles along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a final project made for DIG 4715 - Game Production at UCF.</p>\n<p>Developed by:\u00a0Ross Brinkman, Grant Gillian, Seth Ruiz,\u00a0Augusto Llamas, Brian Mikolajczyk, Noah Goyette, Samwise Majchrzak, and Kevin Le</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T08:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49b0c7dc18f7301800fe7e3fe48819df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kev Le"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
