The theme of the jam was \"<strong>It doesn't make any sense</strong>\".</p>\n<p>Maybe, we did respect the theme a bit too much... But it was a great technical challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the goal of the game ?</strong></p>\n<p>You are a ghost trying to <strong>find the goal</strong> to complete the level. The map is filled with heal packs, robot enemies, collectable bonuses, ammo canister, and buildings.</p>\n<p>The character can either, kill with projectiles, dash and eat target or step on a target.</p>\n<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>\n<p>Each level are different because, <strong>every objects</strong> listed before <strong>can have</strong> the property and the<strong> behaviour of other</strong> objects listed !</p>\n<p>So,<strong> your goal is to find</strong> <strong>which action</strong> on which <strong>object</strong> will give you a completion point <strong>to finish the level</strong> !</p>\n<p>But be careful, among those behaviors, some can <strong>kill you</strong>, so be careful !</p>\n\n<p>We also made a\u00a0procedural level generation that allows you to play unique level with random objectives and\u00a0behavioural distribution !</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and Have fun !</p><p><strong>Inputs :</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Development team :</strong></p>\n<p>Game Design</p>\n<ul><li>Simon Cambay</li></ul>\n<p>Game Artists :</p>\n<ul><li>Erwan Adonai</li></ul>\n<p>Game Programmers :</p>\n<ul><li>Nicolas Yoteau</li><li>Anthony Canteloup</li><li>Sylvain Th\u00e9odore</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T08:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00e79e82b3114136b712a55ca1831107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ydalict"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
