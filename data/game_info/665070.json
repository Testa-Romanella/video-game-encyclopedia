In this demo, a cube pushes a yellow ball to trigger series of\u00a0dominos, one of whose branch releases a box of balls, and the other branch keeps on pushing down larger and larger dominos.</p><p>I found that objects that are not physically\u00a0connected (i.e., having any joint parts) can still be considered as a rigid body, which motivates me to design a \"sliding door\" for the box. Another interesting fact is that large objects can have a really low mass such that a domino can push another domino\u00a0that is way larger than itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T04:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d048d5aee5b034122ea569bd62c0aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PIG208"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
