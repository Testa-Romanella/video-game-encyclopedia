The rules are as follows:</p>\n<p>1) To win, a Droplet must be the first to stay on the moving platform for 100 consecutive seconds. The Droplet closest to completing this goal will be identified with a magical, golden crown above their head, so competitors know who they have to target in order to steal the lead.</p>\n<p>2) Only 10 Droplets are permitted on the platform at once. Any other athletes waiting to compete will be placed in a queue, and will be spawned into the game as soon as a currently competing Droplet is eliminated.</p>\n<p>3) Droplets are eliminated by falling off the platform, or being carried away by various hazards. </p>\n<p>4) Droplets who are waiting in the queue can vote for which hazards come into play. Try voting for the ones you think will eliminate your competitors faster, so that you can get into the game quicker!</p>\n<p>Good Luck, Droplets! </p>\n<p>And may the winds blow in your favour~</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>DewDrops was made in 4 days using the HappyFunTimesEngine in Unity by a team of 3 Game Design students at Sheridan College for an in-school game jam competition (\"Sprint Week\").
