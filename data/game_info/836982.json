Just think of it like interactive fanart. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything here is most of what was worn on the EU leg of the Return tour in 2021, featuring such iconic outfits like Meta Man, clown and short shorts.<br/></p>\n<p>Notes<br/></p>\n<ul><li>If you're using mobile, the aspect ratio will go a bit weird but you can still play!!</li><li>There is no sound, I assume whoever plays this will have MCR playing on spotify so you won't need any extra background noise</li><li>I am neither a professional developer or an artist, so there will be bugs and some of the art will be ugly - I'm just one person doing my thing as a hobbyist.
