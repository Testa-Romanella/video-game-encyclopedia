This is a retro space simulation game. The point of the game is to mine asteroids, trade between bases, survive space, and profit! Go download my demo here and tell me what you think? The game is available to play on Windows, Mac, and Linux right now.</p>\n<p>DEV Page: </p>\n<p>www.strartru.wordpress.com</p>\n<p>I am currently on demo alpha 0.06. I have only been working on this game for a week or so. Although I have made a ton of progress. I have successfully funded this game on Kickstarter and will be putting it on steam green light. I am still accepting donations for further develpment. If that works I'll port it to android and Ouya. If I make more money, I'll hire an artist/musician to make it look and sound better. That's the plan anyways.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any tips or other places I should consider submitting a demo? Thanks for taking the time to look at my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859acc2e0ba868b0c2f40f78d74acfdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["maunderingcabal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
