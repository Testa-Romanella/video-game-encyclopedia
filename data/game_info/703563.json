I hopefully hotfixed it, but if you encounter any issue with it, you can use the windows/linux build.

Because of this, it is not a polished experience, just an interesting prototype :) .<br/></p>\n<p>A game by TwistyDev, sprites and (tons) of feedback by Geek_Joystick. Made possible by the whole (awesome) Godot community (special thanks to Juan Linietsky, GDQuest and Bitbrain). Dialogic and a shader from casualgaragecoder have been used. Sounds from Mixkit.<br/></p>\n<p>(Free Electron comes from the french expression \"\u00e9lectron libre\" (loose cannon), which refers to someone who is unpredictable) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7ee09cd17060b15ae9394adadc8a435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TwistedLlama"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
