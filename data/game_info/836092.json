Each successful attack, counterattack, and spell cast increases the fighter's rage, making them more lethal. After the battle, the rage fades away.</p>\n<p>Each ally on adjacent squares horizontally and vertically makes the fighter more agile, but each opponent on these squares hinders his movements.</p>\n<p>Each wound reduces the agility of the fighter. Has no effect on the player.</p>\n<p>If fighter is seriously wounded, then he will leave the battlefield, and will be able to return to battle after 30 turns, if your army is not slaughtered.</p>\n<p>If a fighter gets injured, then within 0.2 seconds he has the opportunity to counterattack. To do this, you need to press any button. Also, if the fighter's attack did not reach the target, he himself was not wounded, and any button is pressed within 0.2 seconds, then the blow will casually hit the opponent, inflicting a non-lethal wound.</p>\n<p>To use thrown weapons, you need to attack an enemy outside your attack range, but no more than five cells on any axis. You only have two of these weapons.</p>\n<p>An attempt to leave the square may fail if there is an enemy on horizontally or vertically adjacent squares.</p>\n<p>The player is the owner of the magic book. The book allows you to weave spells from certain runes.</p>\n<p>Each successful hit or wound received can charge a magic book with one rune. Hitting an elite opponent can charge the book with additional power.</p>\n<p>If more than six runes are stored in the book, this will also convert all runes into a power charge, and the book will glow with a dim red light. Power Charge makes some spells more powerful.</p>\n<p>The first spell cast does not end the turn if there are no opponents on the horizontally and vertically adjacent squares. The flight spell can be casted an unlimited number of times during a turn, and its charges stack.</p>\n<p>The details of how each spell works are known to few.</p>\n\r\nTo download full version you need to pay $5.99 or more", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T12:10:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8abaf3dd0d81224b19ad419178c7f7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["The Elder Dogs"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
