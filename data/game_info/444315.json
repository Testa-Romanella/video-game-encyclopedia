While I didn't really spend much time developing a story  for this game, I hoped to re-capture the fun I had with DOOM: quick-paced action, variety of weapons/enemies, finding secrets, and interesting level design.</p>\n<p>Gameplay elements I knew I had to include for this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Fast movement</li><li>90's style FPS artwork (DOOM, DukeNukem, Heretic, etc.)</li><li>Multi-color keycards to pass certain doors</li><li>Many levels, all with DOOM style cutscene\u00a0endings (with player stats)</li><li>Increase level difficulty as each progress</li><li>Secret walls/rooms/actions</li></ul>\n\n<p>There are 5 levels in this game:</p>\n<ol><li>Bunker</li><li>Fortress</li><li>Spider's Nest</li><li>Farm Overrun</li><li>The Execution - The final boss</li></ol>\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nKEY BINDING<br/>DESCRIPTIONWASDMove forward, left, back, right<br/>MouseAim crosshair<br/>Left click<br/>Shoot weapon (+ can hold for the assault rifle)<br/>Space<br/>Open doors, and continuing at end of levels<br/>1, 2, 3, or 4<br/>Switch to weapon in corresponding slot (if available)<br/>\n<br/><br/>My Conclusion\r\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game, I hope can you enjoy it too. I'm still fairly new to Unity, so I'm proud of the progress I was able to make in such a short timespan. I learned a lot with each new thing I decided to tweak to the game. If I had more time, I would have loved to add new weapons, enemies, and many of the badly needed enemy animations. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f17857f48750a30253f29ed921c299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kmw"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
