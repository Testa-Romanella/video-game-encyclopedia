All of the Assets were provided by the course and/or found on the Asset Store.</p>\n<p>This one was great for me to learn more about 3d game development, and especially about unity timeline, but as I wasn't too invested on the genre I didn't put much effort into the level design or game feel.</p>\n<p>I did add the mouse control for aiming! It was fun to do this self-challenge and to research how to implement it alone. </p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning Unity, their course has been great for me! You can find it at Udemy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e68e2de2dafded38bfebebdfee741f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hybrid Strategies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
