To reunite  your two halves you need to explore the graveyard, communicate and find  each other. Since you are playing as a skeleton your eyesight has  degraded a bit, so you won't see your other half unless you are standing  very close to each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>To start a new game come up with a room name, then you and another player can join the room of that name and play together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:  Unfortunately, we are limited to ten lobbies of two players each. If  you experience any connection issues, you might have to try again later.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD - Movement\u00a0<br/>E- Interact<br/>Enter - Chat<br/></p>\n<p>This is an entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2021.</p>\n<p>Art -\u00a0 @h.exe.art<br/>Art -\u00a0 @mezaka_<br/>Sound -\u00a0 @chiara704<br/>Game Design - Jeff Gower<br/>Game Design - @julius_krger<br/>Game Design | Programmer -\u00a0 @ccreepplay<br/>Game Design | Programmer - Leo Peters<br/>Tech Art - Felix Kosian<br/>Programming - @LarsEble<br/>Programming -\u00a0 @marcel_zurawka<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/91292fb0c00f2cc3bf47810b6d071afa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mezaka", "nayrutes", "SpicedPigeon", "NightfallJK"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
