From surprisingly difficult enemies to satisfying 8-bit sound effects, this was made for a love for both procedural generation and old-school arcade games.</p>\n<p>Use WSAD/Arrow Keys to move around, Space bar to attack. On taking the stairs in the first base, you get into a randomly generated room full with enemies. At every room you also get to either increase your damage or increase your health. Once you die, you conveniently come back to start\u00a0 to brandish your score.</p>\n<p>Since I am really bad at art, most of the sprites here are taken from sources listed below. ( If you feel the stairs looked out of place then I am sorry, I tried my best X3\u00a0)</p>\n<p>https://krishna-palacio.itch.io/minifantasy-dungeon<br/></p>\n<p>And since I am worse at sound design, I used the following sources</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/523755/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Tissman/sounds/444671/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Euphrosyyn/sounds/442127/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/DirtyJewbs/sounds/137227/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Volvion/sounds/265308/<br/></p>\n<p>Fortunately, I do know a bit about code. As mentioned, most of the game is made through multiple kinds of procedural generation. Inspired by a talk I found on Youtube (I can't seem to remember which one), I decided to make use of the two years of my Comp Sc. background into making noise maps,\u00a0Dijkstra's paths, and other weird algorithms for making a level. But since this background is only of 2 years, the game is still quite buggy. You are welcome to ask me for the source code if you would like to help me work on the game.</p>\n<p>This is in-development, i.e. you are completely free to suggest me any suggestions or give any feedback, all is welcome.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T08:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/0103a59745949217a59735fdc3092fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["nwlynx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
