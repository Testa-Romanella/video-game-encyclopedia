{"id": 710859, "slug": "six-hell", "name": "Six Hell", "name_original": "Six Hell", "description": "<p>An\u00a0early prototype of an arena shooter game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the moment it's just a boss fight - try to kill the boss as quickly as you can, even while it spawns vile henchbots who try to\u00a0destroy you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD/mouse</strong> - move and aim</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> - shoot</p>\n<p><strong>ESC</strong> - quit to desktop</p>\n<p><strong>F</strong> - toggle fullscreen mode.</p>\n\n<p>Dying adds a\u00a0time penalty to your final score, while collecting scrap gives you a small time bonus.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE V0.1 CHANGELOG</strong></p>\n<p>Got a new version up in time for the extended deadline - still a simple prototype but much nicer to play than the first version.</p>\n<ul><li>It now has sound! \\o/</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Shooting code has been re-done, fixed some bugs and it feels much nicer to play now.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Your final score now takes into account the number of times you died (which incurs a penalty) and the amount of scrap you collected (which gives you a modest bonus)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Recharge/Health booths have bigger trigger areas now so it's easier to use them.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Fiddled with the colours so it looks a bit nicer, and you can now see through the windows into the arena.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES AND TIPS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you keep killing orbs without tackling the planes and generators you'll eventually be overwhelmed. It's recommended to take out\u00a0the planes and generators first, even if more orbs spawn in the meantime.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Keep an eye on your energy (the cyan bar on the right) - if you run out you won't be able to shoot. Recharge at the two booths in the arena, or go to one of the two end rooms which each have a recharger in them.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can also recharge your health at health booths in the end rooms.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can't shoot in either of the side rooms or the outside corridors. This is by design (the final game will have non-violent stuff to do in these areas). You're safe in these areas so you can use them to take a breather if you like, but enemies will continue to spawn inside the arena.</li></ul><ul><li>The orbs can shoot each other, which you can use to your advantage if you're overwhelmed.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>It's not super well balanced yet - if you take out the generators and planes quickly then it's pretty easy to defeat the boss in under four minutes. If you <em>don't</em> take them out quickly then lots of orbs will spawn and you'll be easily overwhelmed.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d92cfb4c18ad16152174678505b8681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Harder You Fools"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
