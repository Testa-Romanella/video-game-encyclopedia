We present to your attention our idea.<br/>The Metal Cycle game will be about a small toy robot that accidentally fell out of the window of a children's room and ended up in a dump on the other side of the city. He will have to travel across the city to his home. Various locations and various robots await him on the way.<br/>At the moment there is only a prototype of this game, but we want to turn it into a full-fledged project.<br/>Comments are welcome. If you would like to support us on the exciting journey of developing the game, we would be very grateful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce241b655765ad33da1859e0bad601ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floriellis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
