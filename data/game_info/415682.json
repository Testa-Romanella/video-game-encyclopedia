As you run and jump your way through the facility avoiding deadly lasers, you\u2019ll collect Grapple and Dash abilities that will expand your\u00a0moveset. You\u2019ll be able to grapple to various points scattered about the place, move walls to make paths, and smash through glass walls in mid-air.\r\n</p>\n<p>All you need to do is reach the reactor room at the bottom of the building. Getting there won\u2019t be simple, though: you\u2019ll need to return to the starting area every two minutes to save and recharge your battery, otherwise your progress until the last save is going to be lost. To do so, you\u2019ll have to unlock shortcuts and find alternate paths to optimize your descent as much as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll use switches and keys to open doors, ride elevators throughout the various rooms, and check a constantly updated map of the rooms\u2019 layout, making it possible to explore the space in a non-linear fashion. The challenges you encounter will nonetheless increase in difficulty as you progress and will test both your reflexes and your quick thinking.\r\n</p>\n<p>To run Dead End, you\u2019ll need a controller and a relatively powerful system with a dedicated graphics card.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00ec6400f57899eacc8260c55fd731b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
