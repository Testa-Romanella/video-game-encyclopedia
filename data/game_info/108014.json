No need to know the rules, these bots don\u2019t know them either.</p>\n<p>Your power will keep<strong> running out</strong> though, and you\u2019ll need to pick power-ups on the field to get a temporary boost and be able to kill some of those pesky robots. If you let your power level run too low, you\u2019ll get slower and probably die an horrible death soon enough.</p>\n<p>It features 3 (or maybe 4?) types of enemies, 40+ levels, and a lot of stupid ways to die.\u00a0Just like for all my other gamejams, the music is my band\u2019s, Uniform Motion, check us out!</p>\n<p><strong>I coded and designed PowerPlay from scratch, on my own, in around 60 hours during #LDJAM39, using Unity, Photoshop, After Effects, Cinema4D, AssetForge, XSplit and Github. And Spotify all along.</strong></p><p>Oh and there's also a web version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c8e9129b27f53569127edd3ad17f13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["More Mountains"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
