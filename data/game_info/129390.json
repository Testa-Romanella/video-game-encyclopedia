Help Bob get to his meeting on time by getting back these parts from the zombies by using a combination of stealth, cards and head on offense! This game will blow you away. But beware, some zombies that have taken your parts are much much stronger and it will take a lot more stealth to take back the parts, so you have to play this strategically... Try your luck ;) <br/></p>\n\n<p>How to play? :</p>\n<p>\u00a0- You start on top of a small cliff overlooking your broken down car where you have escaped to avoid the zombies<br/>- You can go anywhere in the map using the WASD or Arrow Keys<br/>- By aiming your mouse at a region of ground the player will look there<br/>- Clicking will allow you to shoot your gun<br/>- In order to win<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Kill the enemies with the red light<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Pickup the part that they drop using 'E' \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Run back to your car and press 'E' to put the part inside the car<br/>- If you run inside the white FOV lines then the zombie will chase you (unless you have cover)<br/>- If you shoot a zombie it will chase you as well<br/>- The zombies with the parts are harder to kill and have much higher attack damage and move speed so bewareee!!</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT : <br/></p>\n<p>- There are little cards you can collect by pressing E when near it<br/>- Click on your 'My Cards' menu to open up your cards<br/>- Select a card to activate the power up <br/></p>\n<p>Game Features : - Free Movement in a Small World with Very Nice Models - Ability to directly kill the zombies using a tiny laser gun (harder)<br/>- Timer System to see how quick you can win</p>\n<p>\u00a0 * To see how we made this game, check out the time lapse that will come out on my channel very soon [https://www.youtube.com/user/batchprogrammer108] *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Developers :</p>\n<p>Ajay Venkat \u00a0\u00a0 - 15 years old, Lead Developer, Scene Management, 3D Art -&gt; Twitter and Website : ]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - YouTube : [https://www.youtube.com/user/batchprogrammer108]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - &gt;Advanced and Beginner Unity Tutorials!!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Twitter : @CodeWithAjay \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Website : [www.codewithajay.com]</p>\n<p>Rajin \u00a0\u00a0 - 15 years old, Lead Designer, 2D Art, UI Design, Logo Design + Ideas -&gt; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Twitter : [https://twitter.com/SMiLEYGFX]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Instagram : [https://www.instagram.com/i_am_rajin/]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - YouTube : [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmUbE4YAHX4bHQDnRFZjwKg]</p>\n<p>Johan \u00a0\u00a0 - 15 years old Music Designer, Logo Design + Ideas -&gt;<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Instagram : [instagram.com/hacker_flawless]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Twitter : [twitter.com/hacker_flawless]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - YouTube : [youtube.com/hackerflawless]</p>\n<p>We developed this game in ( &lt; 20 hours) w/ :<br/>\u00a0- Unity<br/>\u00a0- Blender<br/>\u00a0- FL Studio<br/>\u00a0- Paint.Net + Photoshop<br/>\u00a0- Visual Studio</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________<br/>Please Remember : <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please leave feedback on what we can improve with the game<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please inform us if you spot any bugs<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leave a link to your game and we will check it out<br/>:)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>______________________________________________<br/>Expected Improvements : - Larger Space to Play In<br/>- Larger Item list for the Cards<br/>- More enemy types and weapon types<br/>- More detailed modelling<br/>- More levels and more objective oriented<br/>- Use guides etc...</p>\n<p>All of these features were restricted due to time constraints :(</p>\n<p>*Unfortunately this idea was changed halfway through the jam so the features may be incomplete..*</p>\n<p>Creating this game was so much fun and I would be very grateful if you checked it out :) Have a nice day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d45de77540fea6839f7ce68755fb047f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AJTech2002"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
