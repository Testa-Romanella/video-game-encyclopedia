Dodge missiles along the way and travel through randomly generated stations that affect your character palette</p>\n<p>Having more or less of different colors changes your movement options<br/>More red = more movement, Less red = more jumping<br/>More blue = further dashes, Less blue = shorter cooldown between dashes</p>\n<p>This game was made for the bored pixels jam 9</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>- The player hitbox tends to be very forgiving. You may be able to go closer to missiles than you think<br/>- You're invulnerable while dashing</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Ategon - Art, Coding, Menu Music\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batterfingers - Game Music</p>\n\r\nFuture\r\n<p>I had to cut out a ton of content from the jam build due to major time constraints. I may come back and revisit the idea in the future while adding in all the missing features.</p>\n<p>Stuff I had to cut<br/>- Global leaderboard<br/>- Actual enemies instead of just missile spam<br/>- An attack system<br/>- Different characters and better differentiation between color stats<br/>- Key rebinding<br/>- Sound effects<br/>- Most of the animations</p>\n\n<p>*WARNING the downloadable versions have a bug that seems to cause some rapidly flashing lights at times</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c11/c11e55c96bd305ae1dba65096de0ef76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ategon", "batterfingers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
