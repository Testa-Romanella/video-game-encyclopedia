The evil god has been trying to enter the world once more, and this time, he intends to stay and rule a desolate world forever. Forces of good have spent a long time keeping him away but have forgotten the weapons and alliances that stopped him hundreds of years ago. In this situation, you hear rumors in the inns that demons and undeads roam the land. Evil cults are popping up everywhere. And you need to take your blacksmithing supplies to Fallegthorp as usual. To get there you cross the Angrbotha mountains as usual.
