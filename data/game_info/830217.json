Alexi-Ru, a cyborg CSP (cargo ship pilot), tends to fill the void-ness of his boring flight job by day-dreaming of the mysterious stories surrounding planet Sumbra, aka Earth's Shadow.<br/><br/>In the year 3081, the original Earth and it's galaxy has been dead for centuries, and although a few humans still exist,  colonized in far away sectors... Earth's legacy is not forgotten with some even referring to Sumbra, as the shadow of Earth. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Intrigued by Earth's history, Alexi-Ru often finds himself flying millions of light-clicks off his normal cargo route just to speed by the mysterious planet, hoping to catch a glimpse of something on the alien surface via radar that might force him to slow down or possibly even stop. <br/><br/>Eventually Alexi-Ru's curiosity is justified when his ship encounters a malfunction one night, while passing by the tiny planet, forcing him to crash-land on the surface he dreamed of so often on previous flights. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Alexi-Ru remembers his attention right before the impending crash, focused on an un-jostled book, thrown from a compartment during the violent atmosphere re-entry, titled... \"When Day-Dreams Turn To Nightmares\"<br/><br/>\"That doesn't mean anything,\" mumbles Alexi-Ru, trying to re-assure himself as he arms himself with a Tec-9000 semi-automatic and sets forth to explore...
