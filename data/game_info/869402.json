This written guide will provide a brief introduction on how to manage your decks and how to play the game. Let\u2019s first take a look at your Deck Editor.\r\n</p>\n<p>On the right side of the Deck Editor is your card collection, where all the cards you own are stored. On the left side are your owned decks. You can click on one to open a submenu that will allow you to rename, edit, or delete a deck. Alternatively you can create a deck by clicking the new deck button at the bottom.\r\n</p>\n<p>When you edit or create a deck, you are met with the Deck Builder menu. Click on a card in the collection to add it to your deck, or click on a card in the list to the left to remove it. When done, confirm and get ready to play</p>\n\n\n<p>To understand how your cards work, you need to understand their anatomy. Let\u2019s start with unit cards, the manpower of your deck.</p>\n<ul><li>A unit\u2019s history power, found at the top left of a card, ranges from 1 to 3, and is the historical likelihood that the depiction of warriors found on a card actually existed in the Viking Age. This stat is relevant when history cards come into play.</li><li>Damage and health (to the left and right respectively) are self-explanatory. Whenever units fight in close quarters, they will deal their respective damage values to the opponent\u2019s health.</li><li>Abilities are unique unit-specific skills that allow cards to bend game rules in different ways.\u00a0</li><li>Action cards are different from unit cards. They are single-use, powerful effects that are activated by being placed on the grid.</li><li>History cards work like action cards, but deal with meta-game narratives, interpretations, and can uniquely affect the flow of the game based on the history power of units in battle.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s analyze the battlefield.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>On the left of the grid you have your deck, morale counter and the priority coin. The priority coin switches from side to side every turn. Whoever has the priority coin will have their cards\u2019 abilities and movement resolved before the opponent\u2019s.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>On the right side you have your action points. These can be used every turn to draw or deploy cards. Drawing costs 2 and deploying costs 1. If you are done spending your action points, press the End Turn button to pass the turn to the opponent.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>The grid is the space available for combat. The row in your closest proximity is your safe zone.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The two rows beyond your safe zone are called the \u201cnear field\u201d. You can deploy units anywhere within your safe zone and near field, after which they will march towards the opponent by themselves.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Units cannot move into the opposing player\u2019s safe zone, but they can stand just outside of it and attack it, lowering morale by 1 per attack. Your goal is to defend your safe zone and attack the opponent\u2019s. A player also loses 1 morale whenever one of their units falls in battle. Whoever\u2019s morale reaches zero loses the game.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Now that you have a basic understanding, Scholar, rally your warriors, and test their might!</p>\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the game, feel free to join our growing Discord\u00a0community\u00a0HERE:\u00a0https://discord.gg/PQFhM4fh\u00a0<br/>You will get to share your experience with the game to help its development, join potential upcoming community events, and\u00a0socialise &amp; interact directly with us!</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates:</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://www.gamucatex.com/<br/>Facebook:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Gamucatex/<br/>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/gamucatex/<br/>Linkedin:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/company/gamucatex/\r\n<br/>\r\nYouTube:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCByXal4yCWLN6WhI0hivklw<br/>Twitter:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://twitter.com/gamucatex?s=20&amp;t=NJPW3_JOlcFKJ0HRmNJ8Fw<br/>Twitch:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/gamucatex</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T15:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/404/4043b9e1ea2a7b525d331b5eaa4d543e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["GAMUCATEX"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
