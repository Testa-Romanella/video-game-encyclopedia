Coded particle systems of light, hand drawn art brought into form with copper, and 360\u00b0 film of riverways running through Nkwejong in Michigan are merged into technology-empowered storytelling. The work reflects the worldview passed on to me by mother Grace L. Dillon who coined the term \u201cIndigenous Futurisms\u201d\u2014our stories share science. So, too, can our stories be shared through technology. My greatest hope is to show ways in which our ways of knowing can be experienced through design.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Along the River of Spacetime</em> does just this by embedding Anishinaabeg scientific teachings within user interactions. The leaps in the journey are activated with an Anishinaabe symbol which parallels a particle physicists theorize may relate to teleportation, recently recognized by the LHCb experiment at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider. As riverways are fully restored, Anishinaabeg teachings about water unravel to the light of stars nourishing medicinal plants into form.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SHOWINGS</strong><br/>Shown in the\u00a0DEPTH Exhibition at the\u00a0Science Gallery Detroit in Detroit, Michigan.
