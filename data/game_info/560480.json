But I recommend trying it with OPEN-MSX because it is much more accurate.<br/>I tested it with Philips NMS8255 machine. The name of the game is \"CRAFTY BEAR\".\u00a0<br/>Small explanation of the game.<br/>Behind 5 trees hides a crafty bear who wants to make fun of you. It will appear on either side of the tree for a few moments.\u00a0<br/>You will have to hit him with a dagger. In addition to the score at the top of the screen, on the right hand side there will be a 'BEARS'\u00a0 hit counter. The latter will count the bears affected every ten appearances. And it will start over when you pass the level.\u00a0<br/>In the beginning you will have 5 chances to fail, and every time you pass the level, you will have to make one less mistake,\u00a0 until you can no longer fail.\u00a0<br/>It is played with the 2 cursor keys; left and right and the space bar to throw the dagger.<br/>Good fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T10:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31fb0c1dcdd8224c1e713faf10adabf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
