The color of a cell is an indicator of it's diet ; Green cells will seek and eat plants, red cells will seek to eat non-red cells, and the orange cell (you) can eat green cells and plants.</p>\n<p>A cell will split into two children upon eating, and once the children mature they can eat too. One plant matter can eventually spawn 4 red cells, so the population can explode quite rapidly!</p>\n\n<p>Originally a Hunger feature was planned to encourage the player to make strategic diet decisions on the fly, and to penalize strategies such as eating all herbivores at the beginning of the game or just running away from reds. However, we felt other features had priority and we weren't able to implement hunger within the 3 hour time limit.</p>\n\n<p>Asset credits:</p>\n<p>TeeKay - Cell sprite base</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/cell</p>\n<p>Prushik - What became the plant food type</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/trees-3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:41:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/462b68b5953d542128559b71bc17b9bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ohhm"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
