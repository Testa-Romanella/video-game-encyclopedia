The mechanical experience of a game is understood through the concepts of mechanical achievability. That is to say, is it possible, given a player\u2019s profile of cognitive and motor abilities, that they can complete the game\u2019s challenges?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our capstone team (Mactivision) has developed various cognitive tests disguised as mini-games which will measure users\u2019 strengths and weaknesses in performing various atomic challenges (game tasks), each corresponding to different cognitive and motor abilities. Digger measures Finger Pressing, Feeder measures updating Working Memory, and Rockstar measures Divided Attention.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa49ad9529a07be5ec251203fe1b285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chiubacca44"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
