When I was a child, I was always fascinated by the \"Guess Who I Am\" segment in Pok\u00e9mon cartoons. The ability to recognize different creatures just by their silhouettes was amazing! Even in real life, various shapes like a leaf or irregular tiles often sparked my imagination about monsters.<br/>This game follows the same concept. In the world of Wandaland, you can collect a variety of creatures by unlocking different shapes. <br/>All the creatures are formed by the division and combination of \"cells\". During gameplay, the focus is on observing the shapes rather than thinking.<br/><br/>Gameplay instructions: The red cells will not retain the intersecting parts, while the blue cells will behave in the opposite way. Right-click to toggle the colors.<br/><br/>Game content: Includes six scenes from the deep sea to outer space, with a total of 48 levels.<br/>Total gameplay time: Approximately one hour.<br/>Game features: Cute artwork and relaxing music.<br/>If you are interested, thank you for purchasing! \u2764\ufe0f<br/>****Due to the departure of the programmer, there will be no modifications or updates****", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-24T02:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/839/839fea72df3a13f363b4023573f71f07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XCC"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["XCC"], "esrb_rating": null}
