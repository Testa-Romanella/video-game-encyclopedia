Get those baby dragons under control with 1 or 2 players and clean up their messes!<br/><br/>The game supports controllers, but only tested with Xbox One style controllers.<br/>Controllers must be connected at the title screen or the controls screen to work!<br/>If only one controller is connected, you can press the spacebar to change which player is assigned the controller at the controls screen.<br/><br/>You can press Escape to quit the game at any time.<br/><br/>This game is a PROTOTYPE. I made this in my free time and I'm not entirely sure in what direction I want to take it, but I hope you enjoy! I may add more levels later.<br/>I am very open to feedback, please leave your thoughts!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T06:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/fea37656b3c0817464d9ea94c764ff98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TongueSurgery"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
