There is a countdown timer above your reticle, you must shoot enough targets before the timer runs down to zero.</p><p>Use your mouse to control your aim, use WASD to move your character in the world, press left mouse button to shoot. Shoot the green blocks for points and the white blocks for extra time. Avoid shooting the yellow blocks. Once you reach enough points, you will be able to go to the next level.<br/></p><p>It was originally made as part of an exercise for Michigan State University Game Design and Development Specialization on Coursera, so I would like to thank both Brian Winn and Casey O'Donnell.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ead3c0398dae00bee73d21571e189cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcoTTC"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
