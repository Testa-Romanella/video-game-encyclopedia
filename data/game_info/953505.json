If your Windows block the game execution file, you must accept that you want to play or pause your antivirus\r\n<em>\u00a0STORY</em>\n<em>You will be a journalist investigating the case of the deaths of some babies in a hospital, but the situation degenerates to the point where you don't know if what is happening is real and you find no choice but just to fight and to find the way out</em>\n<em>HINT<br/><br/>Interact with objects around you, for example, turn on the light in a room or read a note. Be careful when you have to fight with some enemies, because in this demo there is just one autosave at the start of each new important area.
