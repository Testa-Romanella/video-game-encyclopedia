You play as our young amnesiac hero, who woke up from a year-long coma into an unknown world. He remembers nothing and recognizes no-one from his former life. What happened to him? That\u2019s for you to find out.<br />\nThe game is populated by a variety of characters, each with their own distinct personality, background and secrets.<br />\nSpecial attention and care is put into the quality of the images and animations.<br />\nGAMEPLAY:<br />\nMore than 2500 imagesMore than 200 animationsMore than 20 charactersFree RoamMany locations to explore in detailTime CycleRelationship system.A variety of fetishesTask logPhoneAchievementsSecrets and easter eggs<br />\nWHAT\u2019S COMING:<br />\nThis is how I want the game to look. It is a Free Roam title, with each character having their own schedule and story. The main storyline develops along with the protagonist&#39;s relationship to the main characters: Alexandra, Kate and Elena. The basic outline of these relations is a system of 6 levels, with each increasing level allowing for new interactions in Free Roam.<br />\nAs the main plot develops, the player character will encounter secondary characters (girls). I\u2019ve already written about 10 of these secondary girls, but the idea is to bring this number up into the dozens, with each girl having their own plot and relationship levels (from 0 to 5): each level will bring up hotter and hotter encounters.<br />\nEARLY ACCESS:<br />\n\u201cEarly access\u201d means that you can start playing right now, but you\u2019ll find that some of the game\u2019s features are still to be fully developed. For example, I\u2019m planning to introduce various mini-games which will help in upgrading the player character and advancing the plot. The game features voice acting, but it\u2019s still a ways to go from the level of professionalism that I\u2019d like for each of the animations. I would also like to introduce skills for the main character which will weigh-in on his interactions and make branched scenes according to each player\u2019s particular dialogue choices. Finally, I want to take the post-processing of images and animations to the next level. For this, I will probably need to get a powerful workstation, in order to produce higher resolution images and 60fps animations: all for the sake of perfection!<br />\nI also plan to fully develop the plot beats and interactions of supporting characters, but only after the main storyline is finished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T11:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a45748db37f9048f08fb8a6189d79e77.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/SUPER_ALEX", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 21, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 12, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Super Alex"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Super Alex"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
