Of course nearly every single submission was about digging mines or diving. My game was a little special in that the player has to dive down as deep as possible while still having to manage air and have the right amount to reach the surface. The diving was turned into a delicate balance between dodging the fish and moving faster downwards. Then the obstacle would be reaching the surface in time.</p><p>Instructions:<br/></p><ul><li>Press W to go forwards.</li><li>Press A and S to rotate</li><li>Press R to restart</li><li>Try to go as far down as you can without losing oxygen. You have to reach the top again as well. </li><li>Don't hit the fish.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7b3cee53679d34950322cf8ad4b8e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Impmaster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
