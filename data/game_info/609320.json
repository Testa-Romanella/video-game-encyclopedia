Using state-of-the-art, yet confidential technology, they are able to send out good dreams to all within their area to give an equally good night's sleep.</p>\n<p>You are an average factory worker, coming into work on time like usual. However, it seems eerily quiet for the morning.</p>\n<p>It turns out there's been an accident and the manufactured dreams have affected parts of the factory. And they seem to be distorting rather heavily and potentially putting the entire place in danger.</p>\n<p>Everyone else seems to have evacuated, but you have an unhealthy attachment to your job. And so you run further into the factory to find the Anti-Dream Emergency Lever and cleanse the entire factory of the mess.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD/ARROW KEYS IS CONTROLS\r\n</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>E to interact with switches</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Joshua Matthews:\u00a0https://linktr.ee/joesuamusic</p>\n<p>Level Design(white-box):\u00a0Blaze Shiell:\u00a0Blaze - itch.io</p>\n<p>Programmer: Nathan Sun:\u00a0https://nsun-dev.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer: Jordan:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/whimsical-cloudheart</p>\n<p>UI &amp; Frontend programing: Nicholas Bollong:\u00a0themusicman900 - itch.io</p>\n<p>Art Lead and Animator: Lexis H:\u00a0https://lehxra.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Concept Art:\u00a0Janis Schreiber:\u00a0https://ai864.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0efa5171f5c2aa232de4b0bcfd0ea975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lehxra", "ai864", "themusicman900", "NSun_Dev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
