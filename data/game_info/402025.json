At least you would be if you hadn't blocked the doors so guests couldn't get in to the lavish announcement dinner. It seems someone carelessly wedged some chairs against the doors. Now it's just you, your decades of training, the conducting machine that is putting you out of work and a lot of expensive glasses and plates ... all alone in the room. What could possibly happen?</p>\n<p><strong>Encore</strong>\u00a0is the tenth chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series.\u00a0The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>Encore</strong> is based on the 2017 Global Game Jam theme of \"Waves\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d73ae4633b11b4cd58a50f6fdc71c2fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
