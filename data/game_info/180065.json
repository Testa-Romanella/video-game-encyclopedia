The journey took a\u00a0while, but\u00a0everybody seemed friendly - all the cars sounded their horns and waved\u00a0their arms at him as they overtook his tractor. Jack was\u00a0happy to be\u00a0off the motorway in the end, and along the scenic, familiar winding\u00a0lanes through the badlands before he got to Jon's farm.</p>\n<p>Farmer Jon wasn't\u00a0in such a good mood when Jack finally arrived\u00a0though. \"Them buggers\", he cried, \"every June they come\u00a0roaming round\u00a0me fields, looking for a festival. Eavis' farm's not another\u00a020 miles\u00a0away from 'ere in Pilton, but they're all too stoned to notice,\u00a0pillocks! Ravers, Hippies and Hedge-Monkeys, same time every\u00a0year.\u00a0Just as I sow my crops they come trampling around, treading in the\u00a0seeds and ruining it all - 'elp me Jack\". \"Eee, that's\u00a0trouble at'mill\u00a0and no mistake\", mused Jack, \"but m'tractors pretty nippy - I'll belt\u00a0round and get them seeds up for you\" offered Jack. Jon gladly accepted,\u00a0tired-out by chasing the hippies, monkeys and ravers across the levels\u00a0all day. \u00a0\"I've no cows on them fields no more after that\u00a0blue-tongue\u00a0trouble, so you can move the gates all you need - that'll really\u00a0confuse 'em! Thanks Jack\". \"No trouble\", said Jack,\u00a0\"I'll start in<br/>morning\".</p>\n<p>\"Proper Job!\"\u00a0said Jon, smiling at last.\"</p>\n\n<p>After writing <strong>Stranded\u00a02.5</strong>, which with its 48 levels took a while to\u00a0complete, I needed to do something quick &amp; fun to get back into\u00a0the\u00a0swing of things again, and so Farmer Jack returned with\u00a0another\u00a0conversion of an 80's arcade game missing from the Spectrum - this time\u00a0with \"Ladybug\" - written as a thank you to Simon who runs Cronosoft and\u00a0has always wanted a Spectrum version of it.</p>\n<p>Using the first\u00a0Farmer Jack game as a base for the code I also tried to\u00a0address some of the criticisms of the first and so locked the game to a\u00a0constant frame-rate and improved the controls, but this time did a\u00a0pretty straight conversion of the arcade - albeit with Jack &amp;\u00a0Hedge\u00a0Monkeys instead of the insect theme of the original.</p>\n<p>(\"Hedge Monkeys\",\u00a0as the internet will tell you if you ask it, is a\u00a0west-country term for hippies as they tend to look as if they live in\u00a0hedges. Living in Somerset as a child the game's story is\u00a0loosely based\u00a0on the annual invasion of them for the Glastonbury festival, when you\u00a0could still jump the fence and it wasn't in the least bit trendy!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> -\u00a0\"<em>...Lee du-Caine's superb AY beeps and tones for\u00a0128K variants ... everything is slickly executed, colourful and cute.</em>\"\u00a0- 8/10</p>\n<p><strong>RGCD</strong>\u00a0- \"<em>Hedge Monkeys is an excellent version of Lady Bug - a game that did\u00a0not see an official conversion to the Spectrum. ...This is a really\u00a0phenomenal version of the game with all the\u00a0addictiveness (and difficulty) of the game that inspired it. Playing\u00a0this game has even improved my skills on the arcade original.
