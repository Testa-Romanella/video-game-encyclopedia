{"id": 288364, "slug": "age-of-the-avatar", "name": "Age Of The Avatar", "name_original": "Age Of The Avatar", "description": "<p>Lore: Veering from traditional static lores, and introducing a learning mechanic for AI to remember events that have happened and piece together dynamic quests to keep the lore constantly changing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Combat: Hotbar styled with per-weapon abilities, aswell as per skill abilities. Magic is more of a hidden skill, and very little residents (npcs) know about it. You will not start off with magic, or range. Range will be learned by choice in an undetermined place. However Magic will be awhile before players see any bit of witchcraft.</p>\n<p>Crafting: Traditional station-based, with hidden recipes to learn throughout your experience.</p>\n<p>Housing: Claims, both Residential and Farm land is permitted in certain areas with a Land Deed and can built up upon with both in-UI objects and items found throughout your experience or crafted.</p>\n<p>Pets &amp; Mounts: Both land, and Flying will be available as of current build. Water Mounts and Pets will come over time.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Website Link</p>\n<p>Discord Link</p>\r\nA lot of this game is unfinished, and is only available to test as I go.
