The aim is to collect all the balls by rolling a cube and expand your \"garden\". But beware! The cones must not be touched, and the path must not be left. A game with a chill factor: Relaxing music accompanies over 50 tricky little levels.<br/><br/>Not in chill mode? Then you can also rush through the puzzles and complete the game as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>But treat yourself to a little relaxation, Calma costs less than a coffee to go and you are supporting a passionate indie developer.<br/><br/> Many Thanks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T09:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7352b76ebb29be3a8a1721d419bc2915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Pascal Monaco"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Pascal Monaco"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
