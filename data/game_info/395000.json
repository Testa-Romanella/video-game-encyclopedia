You can either make it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes, depending on your skill.

During the Level, the player faces 5 Situations, each a little harder than the one before. Situation 5 is supposed to be the hardest of the situations. Don't hesitate to give me some feedback on the difficulty.</p>\n<p>Controls are Arrow keys &amp; Space<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8d29d7471c46154c614ab2839cad44f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frzkbl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
