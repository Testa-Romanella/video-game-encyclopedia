Thus, the contents of this game were made over the course of a singular academic year at UPenn off of weekly meetings, a few extra-meeting crunches, and a hackathon. <br/><br/>The game was ultimately not entirely finished, but this build that is now listed on Steam serves to show off the work that the students in this club were able to accomplish on top of their rigorous course loads at UPenn.<br/><br/>The game concept was pitched by Praneel Chakraborty (CAS + Wharton '24), and the story premise was picked by Jimmy Ciardullo (SEAS '22).<br/><br/>Lennart Meincke (SAS '23) served as the project's lead programmer, Meggie Cheng (SEAS '22) served as the game's Art Director, Kevin Zhao (SEAS '22) served as the game's Sound Lead, and Kevin Ma (SEAS '25) and Jimmy Ciardullo (SEAS '22) served as the game's lead writers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T06:44:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/017588aedb9e461f80626885595c7ec4.jpg", "website": "https://www.pennupgrade.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["University of Pennsylvania Game Research and Development Environment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["University of Pennsylvania Game Research and Development Environment"], "esrb_rating": null}
