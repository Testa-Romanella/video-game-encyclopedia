{"id": 980306, "slug": "100-kills-challenge", "name": "100 KILLS CHALLENGE", "name_original": "100 KILLS CHALLENGE", "description": "100 Kills Challenge is a fast-paced first person shooter, combining the bloody reality of modern combat with a return to basics: Kill one hundred enemies before anyone else. How you do it is up to you: Be brutal, be clever, fight on your own or as part of a team, just be the first to reach one hundred kills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pick from meticulously rendered costumes of special forces operators, police response teams, criminal gangs, and terrorist groups, then fight across a dozen maps representing real world hot spots. Spill blood across the world, from downtown construction zones mired in gang warfare, through militia compounds in the boonies, to the iconic Duga-2 radar near Chernobyl.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fight using meticulously replicated real-world firearms, from submachine guns, through semi- and automatic rifles, to DMRs and light machine guns. Use the map to lay traps or give a wake-up call to a camping sniper with a well placed grenade. Then rain down hellfire using drones, bombers, and gunships, racing for the ultimate goal. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Remember the rules: There are none. All that matters is reaching one hundred kills: Fighting as a lone wolf in 12 player deathmatch, as part of Blue or Red teams in team deathmatch, or facing a computer-controlled onslaught in our brutal PVE modes. And remember: The amount of ways to kill will increase, as the game is being constantly expanded and developed!<br/><br/>May the best player win!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T04:38:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac5d668c8fe0ebd2605fd3bff4c9b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kane Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kane Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
