Fight paper robots with paper guns, in a paper simulation. Maximum paper!</p>\n<p>Each time you defeat a batch of enemies you get the chance to spend earned bounty money on upgrades in the shop. Waves get progressively harder and more challenging. There's a total of 11 waves with last one being the boss battle. Every death is permanent and no upgrades carry on.</p>\n<p>TIP: Melee punches usually kill in one strike and regain some ammo based on what weapon you're currently using, they however cost stamina.<br/></p>\r\nNOTES\r\n<p><strong>Game Duration: </strong>~15 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong> that this game has been made in 48h and so bugs can occur, as well as there's not that much content yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Note2: ESC </strong>goes back to the main menu without saving your game!
