Waking up unable to see, can you use your new echolocation abilities to find the Staff of Ataraxia? It's said that a large statue of Anubis holds it to show its great power.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Move and Look: Joysticks</p>\n<p>Snap your fingers: Hold Grip and Press the primary button (typically A and X for left and right respectively)</p>\n<p>Pick up weapons: Grip</p>\n<p>Loose Grab: While holding a weapon, hold the trigger (only effective on Mace)</p>\n<p>Store Weapons for Later Use: Hold a weapon over your shoulder and release the grip</p>\n\n<p>Theme:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>One Time Use: The player has to pick up Ankhs to use as keys to advance. Each Ankh can only be used once, as it will be locked in, once Anubis has it, Anubis doesn't let go (to be clear, you need to put the Ankh into Anubis' hand to progress).</p>\n\n<p>Unique challenges:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Due to taking\u00a0vision away from the player, we had to overcome some special challenges. We look forward to hearing from you on how we did in overcoming these problems.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Developers: Lucas A. &amp;\u00a0Nathan F.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Packages Used:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Autohand: Earnest Robot</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Modular Egyptian Temple: Minod Studio</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monster Bundle #6: Infinity PBR</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FPS Medieval Weapons - Free Starter Pack: Triforce Assets</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fantasy Sounds Bundle: Cafofo</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Individual Assets:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Snapping Audio: ParkerSenk - FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heartbeat Audio: InspectorJ - FreeSound.org</p>\n\n<p>Known Bugs:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stairs don't work quite right while holding weapons. We suggest sheathing your weapons over your shoulder and/or throwing them onto the ground in front of you before going up or down stairs until fixed.\u00a0 Going up stairs with a weapon equipped will be difficult though not impossible. You just need to sway side-to-side instead of straight forward. Going downstairs while holding a weapon simply won't lower you down, you'd have to drop the weapon to return to the floor (issue does not exist with the Ankh keys).</p>\n<p>Known issue with the movement physics, though unable to determine if it is a software issue or hardware drift on controller joysticks, any input on this would be great (trust me, you'll know it when you see it).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T15:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a090bc3dde8ba64295372446e2f7299a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sacred-Sticks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
