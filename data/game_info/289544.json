Whenever you leave home, your battery quickly drains, so you must return home often to recharge yourself. With the help of an old photo, your robot pet Dorg, and all the junk you can salvage from a dilapidated city, you set out to find what home really means to you.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Action\r\n    Keyboard + Mouse\r\n    Dual Stick Controller\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Start Game\r\n    Enter\r\n    A (xbox) | X (ps4)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Look\r\n    Mouse\r\n    Right Joystick\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Move\r\n    WASD | Arrow Keys\r\n    Left Joystick\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Interact\r\n    Left Click\r\n    A (xbox) | X (ps4)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Show Photo\r\n    Space Bar\r\n    Left Trigger | Right Trigger\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Pause Game\r\n    Esc\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n<p>\n<br/>\n<strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Amlag: 3D Character, Prop Art, and Level Design</li>\n<li>Josh Soldate: 3D Environment Art and Level Design</li>\n<li>Steven J Garcia: Composition, Sound Design, and Narrative Design</li>\n<li>Andrew Hung: Graphics Engineering and UI/UX Programming</li>\n<li>Andrew Hermus: Gameplay Programming and Audio Engineering</li>\n<li>Andrew McPherson: Gameplay Programming and Production</li>\n<li>Robert Ackley: Gameplay Programming, AI, and Direction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Special Thanks To:</em> Liann E.
