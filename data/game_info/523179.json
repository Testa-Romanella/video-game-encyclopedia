Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br/>Pete the Snake needs your help in this brand new adventure!<br/><br/>Finding himself trapped in a pond where he is being hunted by unseen enemies, Pete must survive for as long as possible in these strange and surreal circumstances. With only his trusty boat and his own tail to use as an oar, guide Pete as he swims and paddles through these cold, lonely waters to avoid the incoming onslaught of projectiles coming in every direction.<br/><br/>Otterrific Features:<br/>- Assume the role of Pete the Snake, our cute and cuddly and definitely not a dangerous animal of a hero! Kids these days think snakes are cute right? Scalie animals are cuter than those weird furry ones, right?<br/>- Challenge yourself across three difficulty modes: Easy, Normal and Hard! <br/>- Master the blinding bonus mode, Blind as a Mango! What, you never heard of a blind mango? <br/>- Compete for high scores on a local scoreboard by surviving for as long as possible! Just think of the bragging rights!<br/>- Flicker the CRT lines for an authentic old timey telly effect that\u2019s even before my time.<br/>- Original pixel art and artwork! You can tell by their quality (or lack thereof) that they\u2019re not flipped from anywhere! <br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to save Pete? Probably not, since each game mode is endless and you\u2019ll be trying to get high scores, and no matter what, in the end Pete will, umm, go to that snake farm in the country and never return your calls..... But you can try to prove me wrong anyway!<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Remote Play allows users to connect to and play games on their PlayStation\u00ae4 or PlayStation\u00ae5 using a mobile device, PC, or another PlayStation\u00ae4 or PlayStation\u00ae5.<br/>Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br/>Offline play enabled<br/><br/><br/>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; playstationnetwork.com/privacy-policy). <br/><br/>Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense). <br/><br/>One-time license fee for play on account\u2019s designated primary PS4\u2122 system and other PS4\u2122 systems when signed in with that account.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c841a39cfa89f89cbd1299f624bcc17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
