(basicly the main hero of 'insert any shooter' did not show up, so now you need to 'fix' it all).\r\n</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://git.ragarock.moe/5kJam/about/\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0https://git.ragarock.moe/5kJam/tree/credits\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T16:49:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6c13e643a336dc1ae0a2228db9e28b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ragarock"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
