{"id": 543148, "slug": "reawaken", "name": "ReAwaken", "name_original": "ReAwaken", "description": "<p>DISCLAIMER: I know that the skeleton sill not move to the right and I'm aware that killing the Demon is a buggy mess, that being said any additional feedback is appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This isn't the game I intended to finish the semester with, however with the amount of problems I ran into while developing it, it's good enough. I am proud of what I have accomplished and making it to this point was quite a challenge, but I am very glad for the experience I got.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea behind the game was that the Hero would wake up in an unknown forest and was attacked by monsters. Not knowing where they are or why they're being attacked they must defend themselves and solve the mystery. Fighting through the horde will hopefully unveil the answers to the many questions the Hero faces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are WASD to move and the three mouse buttons to attack. W is used to jump, A to move left, S to crouch, D to move right, and each mouse button (left, right, and middle) trigger a different attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To add, I will most likely add in the other assets I prepared for this game later on, I couldn't fit them into the game with the time I had, but I don't feel right leaving them out. Hopefully I can get the other 3 monster types into the game so it can be just a little bit bigger. Currently there are 2 monsters, the Skeleton and the Demon, later on I will add the Imp, the Mecha-Stone Golem, and the Laser Flea.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edffcbe040954715b4f4ddfbf65424d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CoHatt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
