Defend the house before the slimes eating it up.</p><p>You have 2 candies, you can use them to tame slimes, and they will fight for you.</p><p>Control:</p><p>A/D or Arrows = move</p><p>Z/K = jump</p><p>X/L = Put a candy</p><p>Note:</p><p>I'm still working on stages and level design. And lack of SoundFX and victory screens, and more characters with different abilities... Yeah, lots of missing.</p><p>The game is half done because I'm suffering from procrastination, I'm sorry about that. Should you feel boring or upset, I have a plan B in game, just watch the slimes eating your house piece by piece, and it's also a kind of fun.</p><p>Feel free to vote any stars, I believe this game will be awesome when I finished it.</p><p>I'll update this soon, please stay tuned! :)</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Music by Pan Ye.</p><p>Everything else by Pan Feng.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9aca56b3113668929a1142b8e8599f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feng Pan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
