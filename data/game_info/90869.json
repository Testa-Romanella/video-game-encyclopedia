Not being able to predict what is going to happen next or where you are heading for you need to make your way through the increasingly maze-like becoming house to find a way out of this bad dream that you just woke up into. The only thing that goes with you is the wooden floor underneath your feet.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Developer</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMy name is Fabian Zech, maybe known as pheenix93. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThis game was pretty much an one man project, so it took me a lot of time to create. Enjoy!</p><p>A newer version of this game and a sequel to it are available on Steam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42dfbb939e3a6d3412636f8049aeb6e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pheenix93"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
