Here live the Quartzilians, little beings, that use the light of the minerals as source of their magic and energy. Every 10 000 years, the root that powers the crystals has to be recharge, to ensure their survival. A fews hours before the big adventure, each crystal cannon points to the magical source, where the correspondind crystal can be recharge. Only then they know it\u2019s location!</p>\n<p>During the last cycle something terrible happened\u2026 one of the Quartzilians, a smooked quartz named Smokey, found a way to use darkness to recharge the magical root instead of light, took a piece of it and deserted. He found refuge in a dark southern mine and started his own city, by planting the root and charging it using dark energy. He swore revenge to all who dout his intelect.<br/>Almost 10 000 years have passed and the renovation cycle approaches. This means that the light magic is weaker and the dark magic is stronger. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity for Smokey to take over the Crystal City!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you think you have what it takes to recharge the crystals and bring them back to the city in time to save them?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4ee58da1c0198100b4cbacef0055983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarita20t"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
