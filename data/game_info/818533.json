We decided to try a type of game that we had never programmed before, and it turned out to be a pretty ambitious undertaking. The game has a few bugs here and there, but overall we're really proud of what we managed to accomplish in such a short time. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>\n<p>-Credits-\r\n</p>\n<p>A game by\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>James and\u00a0Michael\r\n</p>\n<p>Trujillo\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T11:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65beca58226a8881464616f42d0d6aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FabledForgeGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
