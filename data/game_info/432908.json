He built a small pumping business that he doesn't have time to grow. Now this compagny is yours.\u00a0Improve this business but your uncle left you a key word... Ecology.\u00a0Take care not to (too) pollute the surrounding air. For this, you have the choice between different buildings and tools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a simple city builder. The player will have to build an ecological oil company or not ... but watch out for pollution. Obviously the primary goal is to make it ecological and to reach 1 million credits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For this the player can produce different resources like oil and then refine it. He will have to pay attention to the necessary energy and will have to manage these stocks.</p>\n<p>Good luck ;)</p><p><strong>\u2755 NOTE: For the moment, the game backup is not implemented</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound effects realized with\u00a0SFXR</li><li>Feelin Good by Kevin MacLeod<ul><li>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3744-feelin-good</li><li>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li><li>Wallpaper by Kevin MacLeod<ul><li>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4604-wallpaper</li><li>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>Thanks to @Burger to help\u00a0during the tests throughout development\u00a0of this game.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for the\u00a0IndieCade Climate Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3555a38a2028a217ce5cdd6df7e8b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lanthanum"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
