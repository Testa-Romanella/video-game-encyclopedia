Only the emergency exit signs shed a dim light in the hallways, as Max explores their surroundings.</p>\n<p>Max picks up random items as they cross Max's path. Is Max trying to find a way out of the building? Many doors and hallways are covered in thick roots that Max is not keen on examining closer.\r\n</p>\n<p>The few people watching the stream encourage Max to move forward and are curious about their whereabouts.\r\n</p>\n<p>What is this place, why are the walls covered in roots? What does the outside world look like? How did Max end up here?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Eli Kaunisvesi</strong>, Producer, Writer, Photographer.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Hagman</strong>, Art director.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Linda Honka</strong>, Artist, UI Design.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Lucinda Anderson</strong>, Artist, Audio, Logo design.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Wiljam Sundstr\u00f6m</strong>, Programmer.\r\n</p>\n<p>Featuring art by:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cStella\u201d by Nicole Hjelt\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Saran wrap elf\" by Frankie Sleptsov\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Jam Site Organizers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T11:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34ac3047e6d56916148861c30cc43ee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["xWilQ"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
