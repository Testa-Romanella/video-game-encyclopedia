A catastrophic malfunction of the Hawking reactor threatens the safety of the ship and you, a mechanic on the outer edge of the ring need to get to the emergency shutoff in the central ring before the reactor blows.</p>\n<p>The malfunction triggered a lockdown and the security turrets are active, but they're no match for some percussive maintenance. So it's a good thing you happen to have a near-infinite supply of wrenches on you.</p>\n<p>Note: This is my first game and was done for ludum dare 47 so it is far from polished.<br/></p>\n<p>Source code: https://github.com/magico13/SolarSailor</p>\n<p>Music:<br/></p>\n<p>Screen Saver by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5715-screen-saver<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06d377e48cb6072cd22dc46f7fcb9b05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["magico13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
