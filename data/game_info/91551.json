Join The Heart Breachers operatives as they navigate the world of desire, treachery, and emotional turmoil while learning to understand lofty concepts such as friendship, hope, and belief in oneself.</p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>\n<p>The Heart Breachers is an organization committed to keep humankind safe from the harmful manifestations of their own emotions. Contained within every burst of feelings is an Ignite, the purest form of energy. Negative feelings bear Lingerings, and positive feelings produce Astrays. Astrays are typically tame, but Lingerings could wreak havoc in the real life while driving its host to madness. These projected forms pale in comparison to the Ignites, which might have to be dealt with directly in extreme cases. Often unruly and violent, killing an Ignite means killing its host\u2019s ability to feel emotions permanently\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>CHARACTERS</strong></p>\n<p>Experience the story through multiple set of eyes. Relive your choices from different points of view. Each of the Heart Breachers have their own motivations, goals, and sorrows to overcome and cope with.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0AND MANY MORE CHARACTERS TO COME!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pixel hearts.

The world of Lingering is gritty and hardboiled down to the last pixel. Exercise your reflexes through QTE (or not) and see how your actions affect the plot. Maybe things will unveil a little bit differently than you last remember\u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A little something for everyone.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this story of love and redemption, there is a place for everyone. There are couples from different walks of life, different sexual preferences, and different outlooks in relationships. \u2018Lingering\u2019 is first and foremost a visual novel, not strictly a dating sim, but we do realize that love too is a powerful feeling worth celebrating. Those who are seeking an otome/ge like experience\u00a0should note though that most of our characters have their intended significant other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 </p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> \u2018Lingering\u2019 is lovingly crafted to bring forward stories we want to tell, and therefore may touch darker topics such as portrayals of mental health issues and homosexual romances that not everyone is comfortable with. Some themes and contents might be more suitable to mature audiences.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Remember, there is darkness in everyone. </strong></em><em><strong>And everyone has the right to be broken.</strong></em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd4cfa4a800a2ed2728db5bfc16afdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CeylonEntertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
