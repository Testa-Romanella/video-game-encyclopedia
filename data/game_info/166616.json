He made a terrible typo in the code of his central computer. He accidentally entered \"Go forth and evil\" instead of \"Go forth and live\". The mistake wasn't noticed until it was too late and now he must destroy the central computer in order to stop a robot army from building itself.</p><p>You must build a bomb and locate the central computer. Of course that will not be easy as the robots are armed and dangerous.</p><p>Growing up in the 80's my brother and I got a Colecovision and our favorite game was Frenzy a classic arcade shooter. Ronny Runs around Robots blends elements of Frenzy with another of my favorite games Beyond Wolfenstien.</p><p>You must build a bomb and locate the central computer.
