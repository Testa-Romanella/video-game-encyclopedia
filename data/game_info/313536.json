{"id": 313536, "slug": "fruitfat", "name": "FruitFat", "name_original": "FruitFat", "description": "<p>A casual catching game with elements requiring the player to use quick thinking and planning as well as hand to eye coordination.</p>\n<p>It's simple! You are a Fruitfat, a furry animal that just collects fruits before residing into his tree house to cook and eat them.</p>\n<p>Seeds fall from the sky and it's up to you to decide if you're going to attempt to catch them or let them hit the ground. When a seed hits the ground a tree will grow out of it.</p>\n<p>There are three standard trees, the apple tree, the blueberry tree, and the banana tree. The three trees are of different size and they each grow their own relevant fruit.</p>\n<p>You must catch fruit to gain points, if a fruit hits the ground the ground will rot, allowing fruit to hit the same spot on the ground three times will cause you to lose the game.</p>\n<p>There is also a special seed that grows a special flower when it hits the ground, this flower has a water-based fruit which can be caught for points or allowed to hit the ground to remove rot.</p>\n<p>There are also two large trees on either side of the game space which have goal like openings which you can hit fruit into for points in case you weren't fast enough to catch them with the acorn basket.</p>\n<p>Mole like creatures will come and eat trees, you can allow them to eat trees or block them from doing so.</p>\n<p>If you plant three of the same type of tree, e.g three apple trees, you will receive the ability to double tap the screen and collect all of the fruit on the screen.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, you try to position trees in places where you do not have much rot on the ground and control the number of trees you have by allowing moles to eat them or by blocking the moles as well as strategically catching seeds which are falling in bad areas or letting them grow trees in good places all while catching fruit for points. If you catch fruit consistently without letting them hit the ground you will, of course, enter a combo and each fruit will grant two points instead of one.</p>\n<p>This all happens quite quickly and takes a considerable amount of quick thinking and hand to eye coordination.</p>\n<p>There are two modes, normal mode which can potentially be played indefinitely if you have enough skill and time attack which gives the player three minutes to gain as many points as they can which may be interesting because you want a lot of trees to get lots of fruit quickly but watch out, if you end up with too many trees you will surely rot the ground to the core and lose.</p>\n<p>This game is hand painted and has beautiful music and effects which at times blend with the music so well that you may feel like you are contributing to the instruments within the main song.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a6429d0ece3e86e097627571e3ba07a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamstate Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
