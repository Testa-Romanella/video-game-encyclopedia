It is a great<br/>game, and I encourage you to play it!<br/>http://pathological.sourceforge.net</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>PC: Arrows and XZ keys.<br/>Mobile: On-screen DPAD and OX buttons</p>\n<p>GOAL</p>\n<p>Fill all the wheels with a single color. Once filled, the marbles disappear and the wheel is dimmed. The level is complete when all wheels are dimmed.</p>\n<p>TUTORIAL</p>\n<p>There is an in-game tutorial to guide you. If you want to reshow the tutorial text, open the options menu (RETURN key) and toggle the tutorial off-and-on again.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a late enry, made over the last 3 days and not as polished. The levels are likely unbalanced and I *hope* there are no bugs that<br/>will crash the game. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Wez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f78d44b3059983f87a8088a651f571.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wesley"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
