To find the killer, you must complete errands for the few\u00a0townsfolk who know their identity,\u00a0 then you'll be able to ask them a question about the killer's appearance to narrow down the potential suspects until you have to finally make your accusation. But we aware, you only have three guesses at finding the killer before it's game over.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made with the intention of entering\u00a0MizJam1, but I missed the deadline so instead decided to take another week or so to flesh it out to the full idea I wanted.</p>\n<p>The game is as finished as it will get as it was just a jam game, but if there are a notable amount of bugs that get brought up I will update the game with fixes.</p>\n<p>Please let me know how you get on with the game, good or bad I'd love to hear feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T02:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c7ebe5b1ca23863bf3fb6cbd201a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jakebenbow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
