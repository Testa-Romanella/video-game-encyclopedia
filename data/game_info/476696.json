This money can be used to buy items in the next WAVE.<br/> *Enemies have either TWO main functions:<br/> *A) Target and shoot the player (aka YOU), OR<br/> *B) Dart toward the Crystal and shoot at it.<br/> *It's important to note that the Crystal does regenerate health and has its own weapon to shoot enemies with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BOSS PHASE - After you have defeated all of the enemies in the attack phase, a BOSS will spawn. You must defeat the boss in order to proceed to the next wave.<br/> *The boss will drop a large amount of money once defeated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your HP falls below zero, but the Dairy Crystal is still alive, you will respawn after a short time.
