For this Game Jam we had to create a game using the Clickteam Fusion 2.5 engine, and follow the theme that was set for this Game Jam which was \"Just add water.\" In this game you fly around in a helicopter trying to extinguish fires in a procedurally generated map. My primary responsibility working with both the engineer and artist to make sure we had all the materials needed. I was involved with fine-tuning of game mechanics that included the water and fire contact radius. I heavily playtested the game with both members in order to find the best balance of fun and difficulty. Additionally I did the menu layouts using art supplied by our artist to ensure a professional feel to the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/953/953a18da91c9fec1d8187342c8f432d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rebane"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
