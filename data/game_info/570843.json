I made it in one weekend, so don't expect too much.</p>\n<p><em>How does it work?</em><br/></p>\n<p>There are two lines full of numbers. But they are mixed up.\u00a0 Click them in the correct order (of Pi) from left to right. Here's an image explaining it visualy:</p>\n\n<p>(Click the numbers in the correct order (in this case 3.1415926))</p>\n<p>But how does this game help you memorise the digits? If you get something wrong, you can restart. You will need to restart plenty of times at first, but over time you'll memorise the digits because you press them over and over again. It takes time. \u00a0Some tips: Say the numbers out loud as you press them. The game is divided up into \"blocks\", there is a limited amount of numbers for you to memorise at a time. Once you've got most of them (except one) correct, repeat them (e.g. in the image above you'd repeat \"3.141592\" multiple times). This will make it easier for you to memorise them.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Can I play the game on my phone?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Clicking on a computer with your mouse is technically the same as tapping a number on a phone. Because clicking / tapping is the only control in this game, you can also memorise Pi on the go on your phone, by playing it in your browser.</p><p>You can watch the making of this game here:</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d55dba776dfa9ae9dc22c3e365ad4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Shiny_Emerald_Games"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
