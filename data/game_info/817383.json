As you eke out survival by scouring the wastelands for salvage in your Mechs you\u2019ll tackle the denizens of the wastes. These include bands of wastelanders, terrifying bio-titans, alien constructs and the powerful Corpos who still own the vast majority of resources within the land.\u00a0 Will you find enough salvage to survive in the wastes or fall prey to its many dangers?\r\n</p>\n<p>Salvage Union uses an innovative d20 system with a variable range of resolution and\u00a0combines it with an evocative and customisable set of\u00a0Mech and Pilot abilities. This works in conjunction\u00a0with\u00a0an easy to learn crafting system which allows you to customise your Mechs with additional Systems and Modules and craft new Mechs with salvage you find in the wastes.\r\n</p>\n<p>As well as the core rules to run and play Salvage Union the Quickstart includes -\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>6 Premade Mechs\u00a0\r\n</li><li>6 Premade Pilots\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A sample scenario \u2018The Downing of the Atychos\u2019\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Salvaging rules to craft and modify your own Mech's as well as sample Downtime rules.\r\n</li><li>Additional Weapons, Systems and Modules for your Mechs.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Additional NPC mechs, pilot and creature profiles.\r\n</li><li>A sample BIO-TITAN - Scylla.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c5f7742fa1ca4deb0d7ce0fd8df7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leyline Press"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
