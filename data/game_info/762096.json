Our planet is under attack and you are our only hope because the rest of the planet is underneath nuclear bunkers, the lazy gits. Now, there is one catch. You can\u2019t do this in one go. Even a person as Handsome and/or Beautiful as you would be unable to take on this hoard so we have fitted you with a time machine. This will allow us to try and save us over and over again. Yes, when you die you will still feel the immense pain and there is like a 76.7% chance that time travel is actually just you traveling to alternate dimensions, so we might be doomed anyway but at least you can try and save us. Death is inevitable. Godspeed.<br/></p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Click - Boost\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Shop\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T13:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f60934fa5fbfb1f5874557d561d81419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N.O. games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
