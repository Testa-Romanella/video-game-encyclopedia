The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.\u00a0<br/>The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.</p>\r\nThe project\r\n<p>We started our project with a worldbuilding idea based on Kowloon, the walled city. We imagined it in a future where, from the period 2020 to 2050,\u00a0 social unrests\u00a0in Hong Kong\u00a0against the Chinese government leads to\u00a0guerrilla war by rebel groups and autonomous forces against the Chinese military, and the secession of Hong Kong from mainland China. Later, the walled city itself secedes from Hong Kong, and a declaration\u00a0of independence\u00a0is made.\u00a0At the point we set foot in Kowloon, the city is built so high and close that natural light rarely reaches street level. Triad gangs run most parts of the city, and normal people have to work hard, scavenge or otherwise be resourceful to survive. Before our production we also wrote a short story setting the scene for the aesthetic prototype we where going to create. The story can be downloaded along with the prototype here on this page.</p>\r\nGroup members\r\n<p>Sejr Staugaard - Art director</p>\n<p>Jakob Bang - Lead designer</p>\n<p>Jackie Lai - Senior artist<br/></p>\n<p>Samuel Mathiesen - 3D artist</p>\n<p>Isak Ravn - Tech artist</p>\n<p>Felix Schumann - Concept artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b187d3047099f22eba338076b2ca805a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["isakous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
