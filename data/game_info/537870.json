The bearer of the curse would be born with a small fragment of ice near their heart. As they grew older, the ice would slowly encroach upon their heart and encase it until they die. Although the age of death varies, none of them made it past their 20th year.</p>\n<p>And so, the Esternian Empire met its doom and was replaced by another ruling family.</p>\n<p>One day, the Estern family\u2019s last descendant and bearer of the curse discovered a possible way to break it.
