Hold Space to fly, though I\u00a0recommend staying on the ground and only flying to get over steep terrain. It's more fun that way. Also, press F for fun.</p>\n<p>Whenever you want to generate a new world, press backspace or delete.</p>\r\nSome Technical Things:\r\n<p>In my tests, the\u00a0game has run smoothly on\u00a0Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari (Safari had some minor slowdowns but not too bad).\u00a0I think performance will mostly\u00a0depend on how much memory your browser is already using.</p><p>If you encounter any major slowdowns, downloading and running the executables should work better than running it on the browser.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/610/610dee536c0f8a042e3bffe2879fbf8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web", "PC"], "developers": ["RahulJoshi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
