Bad Trip is a tactical turn-based arpg, without a lot of the arpg elements because I didn't have time for that.</p>\n<p>WASD movement, and you have limited camera movement using WASD while a player is not selected. You can also use \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" to auto select the players. Talk with the Ugly Fairy, they will help you. The enemy turn shouldn't last much more than 10 seconds at its longest, so don't worry if there is a delay between turns. It never got fully stuck for me in my testing, but who knows, maybe you'll get unlucky.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13e6f3a05dc7de5f83d53adbe66cbe56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dierobot"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
