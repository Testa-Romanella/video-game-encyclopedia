Don't touch the ghost/clone and get the next pickup before the time is up, or it's game over!<br/></p>\n<p><em>There was meant to be more narrative to this; a scientist in his house dashing about whilst a time machine went wrong generating clones of himself that he'd have to dodge - but, given the complete design and build time of 4.5hrs, I can't beat myself up!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>A/D</strong> - <em>Left and right</em><br/>- <strong>Space </strong>- <em>Jump/Double Jump - tip; mashing space gives you a bit more welly!</em><br/>- '<strong>M</strong>' - <em>Toggle music</em><br/>- '<strong>R</strong>' - <em>Reset game on gameover</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Known issue; restarting with ghost/clones on the screen doesnt remove them, so you may get caught in an endless loop.
