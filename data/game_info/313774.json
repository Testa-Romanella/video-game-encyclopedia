The sole purpose of each level is to find your partner waiting for you at the end of the level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore for treasure, break crates and barrels, open chests and tombs, but don't stay still long as enemies will find you. Fight skeletons, shamans, run from chargers and face mini bosses (slayer, lava and acid) all while finding your way out.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake the gold you earn from collecting treasure to buy new weapons or upgrade your existing ones. Please note there are no real money options or microtransactions in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRun Gun Die is designed to be tough, but not impossible in a casual adventure setting.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de3400f68c8894d0cb3cdfb825cf75c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.rungundie.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tybug Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tybug Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
