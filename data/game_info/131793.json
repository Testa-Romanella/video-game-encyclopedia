See at bottom.  <br/></p>\n<p>You play as a rogue AI defending yourself against the onslaught of the faceless humans. Basically a \u00a0tower defense game except you activate and deactivate towers instead of building them. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Activate and deactivate turrets by clicking on them</li><li>The more turrets are active, the more energy is used</li><li>If the energy runs out, it will take a few seconds to reset - you will probably die because of it so don't let your energy run out! </li><li>If your energy <em>does </em>run out, remember to deactivate your towers to give it a chance to recharge once the reset is finished!</li><li>Upgrading your speed or your energy uses half your maximum energy</li><li>The computer with an eye in the middle acts as a super-turret when active. It can shoot anywhere on the map, but uses double the energy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Game made using Godot v3.06</li><li>Programming: Pure-Awesome</li><li>Concept: RedFusion Design &amp; Pure-Awesome</li><li>Menu Screen Art: Aerelle</li><li>Evil Eye on Computer: Laetans</li><li>Graphics: Tilesets from itch.io by V-ktor and 0x72</li><li>Music from Bit Bops by Azureflux on freemusicarchive.org</li><li>Assets are Creative Commons v4</li><li>Font is SH Pinscher</li><li>Electronic voice made (by Pure-Awesome) using the e-speak via the SAPI TTS app, and then edited in Audacity.</li><li>A mysterious man made the- it was Walpole<br/><br/>(Edit: RedFusion Design, not RockerScience, sorry.
