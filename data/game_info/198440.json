The goal is to simply reach the exit of each stage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: You can use space bar, left mouse button, or touch to charge up to jump. Escape, or back on android resets the game back to the title screen.</p>\n\n<p>There are a ton of little things I would change, but this is the game pretty much as released.\u00a0 It's difficult to judge timing/speed of platforms, you can't restart just a single stage, and it's not clear that you will pass a platform if impacting on the side.\u00a0It was my first time using unity, and using boo to make a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/1596869012572b595179bfadb7be760e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Elrobo"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
