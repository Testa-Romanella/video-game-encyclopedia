You can run around three rooftops and some interiors.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Basic controls are:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tButton/ControlDescription\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMouseLook around\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tRight mouse buttonZoom\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWASDMove around\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[Space]Jump\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[CTRL]Crouch\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[Shift]Run\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[CTRL]+[Z]Save your position\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[Z]Load your position\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[ALT]+[Z]Reload level\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<p>There are also additional things you can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To perform a wallrun, jump into a wall while not letting go of [Space].</li>\n<li>To perform a walljump, jump while in the air and there is a wall behind your back. You cannot walljump if you are falling at great speeds.</li>\n<li>To perform a pullup, hold [Space], face the edge, and look about 20\u00b0 above or below the horizon. Your head has to be above the edge you want to pull up to.</li>\n<li>To perform a vault, do the same as pullup, only look within 20\u00b0 of the horizon. Your head has to be above the edge you want to vault over.</li>\n<li>To perform a landing, press [CTRL] slightly before or after hitting the ground. This will reduce fall damage.</li>\n<li>To perform a landing roll, first preform a landing, and then press [Space]. This will greatly reduce fall damage.</li>\n<li>To perform a regular roll, crouch, look in the direction you want to roll and press [Space]. If you hold any of the movement keys, you will roll in the direction of movement instead of where you are looking.</li>\n<li>To perform a jump off an edge, that is, to decelerate and fall straight down, hold [CTRL]. You can control the amount of deceleration by varying the duration for which you hold [CTRL].</li>\n</ul>\r\nClosing thoughts\r\n<p>The game has its' problems. The in-game menu is not fully functional, so you cannot adjust volume from in-game. Movement is still rough around the edges, literally. Step-up code could use some improvement, sloped surfaces slow you down (which they should not), and moves sometimes do not work as expected. Overall, good enough for a demo, I think. Hopefully I will update everything in due time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/81721d1ce9fc5a1ed2d54bb4a3d90759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DanilaFoxPro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
