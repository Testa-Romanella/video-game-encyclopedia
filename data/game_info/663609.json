The concept is simple, avoid the spirits, find the key, and open the exit.<br/><br/>My goal was to learn and I learned a lot about what needs to go into a game for it to be a playable experience. It was also important to learn\u00a0\u00a0how to share the game once it is done. I'm inspired to continue practicing game design with\u00a0Godot and I look forward to creating\u00a0larger experiences in future game jams.\u00a0Thank you\u00a0\u00a0for taking time to check out my submission.<br/><br/>Design, programming, and music was done by me. \u00a0Credit to Canari Games for their 8BIT sprites and sound effects. And a special thanks goes out to my son and daughter for play-testing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ec013964a37f6b339c313180d6f3742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FluxPunk"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
