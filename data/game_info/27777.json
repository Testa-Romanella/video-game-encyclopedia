Walk through the landscapes, interact with the environment and \n      learn based of the choices you make. Explore the different roads \n      presented and enjoy the sound and sights of the world.\n    </p><p>\n      Star Sky 2 continues the story set by the previous one, with a similar \n      style of gameplay. There are more choices and most importantly, more \n      consequences. Learn from the choices you make, and see the different \n      paths a life can take, and the scenarios that unfold. The game is a slow \n      experience, that does require some patience, but it is meant as a way to \n      get lost in you thoughts, to feel the game as you are playing, and most \n      importantly, to simply relax.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/66652f070ce57a3ad4285f64ad61acbb.jpg", "website": "http://www.jm-j.com/starsky2", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["JMJ Interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["JMJ Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
