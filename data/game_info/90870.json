She's serious, strong-headed, and confident, but her reasons for choosing to be a hero might not exactly be selfless... <br/></p>\n\n<p>Chisa is Karuna's self-proclaimed squire. She's timid but very strong, if a little naive. Her loyalty to Karuna is unquestionable. <br/></p>\n\n<p>A mage from the Naga clan, and one of the few of her kind that does not view humans with suspicion. Carefree and laid-back, she quickly finds herself fascinated with Karuna's quest and even more fascinated with Karuna's squire. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The great-granddaughter of the paladin hero Estes, Lynette is a well-balanced warrior from Rezael who has trained for years to master both the physical and magical arts to make up for the fact that she didn't inherit her family's holy magic powers. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Now known as Overlord Darkloft, the evil one who has placed the isles of Luxaren in dire peril. Karuna has so many questions for her. What will happen with they finally meet again?<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Warning: Game may on occasion crash when trying to load battles.</strong> This seems to vary from computer to computer, and I've not yet been able to pinpoint the cause. <br/><br/>For the time being, please save often to avoid losing progress.
