(In fact, the rebuilt game runs a lot better than the original one would have.)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*System requirements and the engines driver requirements still apply.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T09:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d61/d61a2ae377338f7df0646d2479fa620d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yaeko"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yaeko"], "esrb_rating": null}
