You don't know how or why you ended up there, but there's one thing clear on your mind,\u00a0 the urge to SCRUB any BLUE thing out of their color.</p>\n<p>Bleach blue tiles in 9 different levels, each with their own unique way/s to completely get rid of the blue tiles in it. Once you completely SCRUBBED all of the blue tiles in each level, there's a small surprise for you somewhere in the menus.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>!NOTE!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>I highly recommend downloading and playing the Desktop or the Android version of the game as those versions are tested out. There might be some bugs in the HTML version.<br/></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>!CREDITS!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Freezing but warm by Meyd\u00e4n | https://linktr.ee/meydan<br/> Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/> Creative Commons CC BY 4.0<br/> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Glimpse of Eternity by Meyd\u00e4n | https://linktr.ee/meydan<br/> Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/> Creative Commons CC BY 4.0<br/> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Leviathan\u2019s Dream Sequence (432 Hz) by Spheri\u00e1 | https://soundcloud.com/spheriamusic<br/> Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/> Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0<br/> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Beach and Friends, 2068 by Komiku<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music: https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27f66cebca011402643bb479b34102d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["SFZero"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
