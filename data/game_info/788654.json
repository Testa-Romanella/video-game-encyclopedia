Don't get too close to <strong>N</strong><strong>uclear Waste Barrels</strong>. You should also avoid <strong>Bluetonium</strong>, which is a very unstable and reactive element. If you bring the two close to each other, you will trigger a <strong>Bluetonium Meltdown</strong> reaction, causing the Bluetonium to decay into <strong>Verdine</strong>, which can then be pushed around safely. The reaction is so powerful that it destroys nearby\u00a0<strong>Waste Barrels</strong> and pushes otherwise immovable one-tile objects (like steel crates) away, even diagonally.</p>\n<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>\n<p>This box-pushing puzzle game contains <strong>30 hand-crafted levels</strong>, some are easy, some very challenging.
