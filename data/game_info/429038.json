An indie multiplayer videogame.</p>\n<ul><li><p>Summary:</p></li></ul>\n<p>Everyone is isolated; in real life, and here too. No one had time to buy their supplies. This is your last chance. Your nearby supermarked</p>\n<p>Your closest supermarket is barely out of stock, and in order to get through the closure, you will need the maximum amount of products to survive... but you're not the only one.<br/><br/>Three other people have thought the same: fight to get as many products as you can before the restocks are done! The shelves will be filling, and you will have to hit them so that the products fall. The more you fill the car, the slower you will move and the easier it will be to hit you to get what you have grabbed.<br/><br/>Three minutes, there's only that! The perfect game to play with whom you share a quarantined flat, and relieve some stress!<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes:\u00a0</strong>solo-play (controller or keyboard) | local multiplayer (up-to 4 players \u2014 just controllers).<br/><br/><strong>WARNING!\u00a0</strong><em>This game was thought to be a multiplayer experience, for families and flatmates confined in the same house during those confinement weeks. The 'solo-mode' was added for those who doesn't have the chance to play in this way, but looks less polished than the multiplayer mode.</em></p>\n<ul><li><p>Controls:</p></li></ul>\n<p>Requirements:<br/>- 1st player: only keyboard.<br/>- 2nd, 3rd, 4rth: only controller.<br/><br/>Move: Left Joystick/ASDW</p>\n<p>Kick (shelves and players) with Dash: B</p>\n<p>Grab objects: A<br/><br/>THE PAUSE/COFFE BREAK BUTTON DOESN'T WORK.</p>\n<ul><li><p>Credits:</p></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lead Programmer &amp; Product Manager:\u00a0</strong>Beatriz Sabater Serna<br/><em>Contact: beatriz.sabater94@gmail.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Designer &amp; Programmer:\u00a0</strong>Maria Eulalia Porto Figueroba</p>\n<p><em>Contact: eulaliaportofigueroba@gmail.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>3D Artist &amp; Animator:\u00a0</strong>Yolanda Cruz</p>\n<p><em>Contact:</em></p>\n<p><strong>3D &amp; VFX Artist:\u00a0</strong>Sergio Such Pic\u00f3</p>\n<p><em>Contact: sergio.suchpico@gmail.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>2D Artist:\u00a0</strong>Carmen Moreno von Thode</p>\n<p><em>Contact: maitethoma@hotmail.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sound Designer &amp; Composer:\u00a0</strong>Jacob Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez S\u00e1nchez</p>\n<p><em>Contact:\u00a0</em>jacobibanez@jacobibanez.com<br/><br/><strong>Tools:</strong><em>\u00a0Unreal Engine 4, Blender, 3DSMax, Adobe Photoshop, Substance Painter, yED Editor.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Font \"Insaniburger\" Credits to:\u00a0</strong>Adam Nerland</p>\n<p><strong>OpenSource Sounds from:\u00a0</strong>Opengameart.org<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>#arcade\u00a0#other\u00a0#multiplayer\u00a0#action</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fde0b94dab87dd25ce7d4fc5128f3c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lalia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
