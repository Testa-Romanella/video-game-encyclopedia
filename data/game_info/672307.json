{"id": 672307, "slug": "little-kingdom-adventure", "name": "Little Kingdom Adventure", "name_original": "Little Kingdom Adventure", "description": "<p>Welcome to Little Kingdom Adventure, a micro-sized RPG by Takuma Gao!</p>\n<p>In this game, you will travel the land of Mystvale, in search of three magic orbs, so that you might save the kingdom from certain doom. The main gimmick of Little Kingdom Adventure is that all of the maps are the smallest possible map size for RPG Maker VX Ace, packing an entire adventure into a teeny tiny area! But, just because everything is small does not mean the game is lacking in content! With four main dungeons to explore, multiple optional bosses and various equipment and spells to obtain, there's quite a lot for you to do in this micro-sized RPG! </p>\n<p>The game should take the average player about 2 hours to fully complete, but there's still a whole lot of adventure to be had in Mystvale! Essentially, everything that you would expect out of a normal RPG is here, but compressed into a tiny form! There's side quests, plot twists, lots of enemies to defeat, and lots of treasure to collect! I hope that you enjoy your adventure in this little kingdom!</p>\n<p>Note: Version 1.2 has been released with a number of fixes. Please redownload the game from this page to update. The changelog can be found in LKA Readme.txt.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4311b80f9151c60ba616f3385bb1a2e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Takuma Gao"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
