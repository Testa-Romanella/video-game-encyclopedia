There are currently 3 levels, each with four stages and their own mechanics, each mechanic containing it's list of keywords for the input.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Horizontal: A-D / Arrow Keys<br/>Jump: W / Z / Spacebar<br/>Open input: Enter / X / Click on input<br/>Exit input: Enter / Esc</p>\n\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<p>Opening the input slows down time.</p>\n<p>When using Gravity is not real, you retain your previous momentum, so using Friction is not real before that may be a good idea sometimes. Without momentum, you can move horizontally only when touching walls.</p>\n<p>Light is not real deactivates collision for light blocks.</p>\n<p>Music made by Loluchi12.</p>\n<p>This is our first time participating in a GameJam, and our first finished game, we will continue to develop and polish it after the GameJam. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e0ec8b809bc1509a4eebbae672a6e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlurOne!"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
