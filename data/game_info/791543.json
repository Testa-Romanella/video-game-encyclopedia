The setting assumes a future where NFTs have become embedded in art, so that players can see the potential implications of using them and then decide for themselves whether or not they support the technology.</p>\n<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are effectively deeds that verify ownership over a digital file. They have become explosively popular over the course of the pandemic. NFTs are highly controversial for a number of reasons. Yet, as more brands come out with NFTs, a future where they are ubiquitous seems more likely.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is only available on Windows, but a Mac build is coming soon.\u00a0The game was made as my capstone project for graduating from design school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Process Documentation for the Game</p>\n<p>My Design Portfolio</p>\r\nHow to Install the Game\r\nInstructions for Windows\r\n<p>1.
