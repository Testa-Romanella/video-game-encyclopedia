Grab your baseball bat and magic power cards and show them that they are not welcome!</p>\n<p>A tiny card based puzzle game with 8 levels.</p>\n<p>Made in a week for the gotm.io game jam.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The goal is to clear the level of all fascists. Each turn you can select cards to move your character (or perform special abilities).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nMove\r\n<p>To move your character, you have to select a movement card (dark red) and then plot a path for the character. Clink on the character, and draw a path.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can only move along the same type of enemy . Some cards allow you move straight, some allow you move diagonally (or both) ...</p>\n<p>When you are happy with your path, click the move button above the selected card.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nEnemy attack\r\n<p>Each round one type of fascists preparing an attack. At the end of the turn, if the player is on a field adjacent to this enemy type, they take damage (if they don't have a shield).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDAF mode\r\n<p>Each level there is a condition to unlock the powerful DAF mode, which replaces your deck with one DAF card.
