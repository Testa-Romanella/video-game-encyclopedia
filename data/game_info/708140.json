In this game you ask questions rather than use EXAMINE. (It's a very short demo to illustrate this idea.) So you might type \"ROPE?\" instead of \"EXAMINE ROPE\". Note: you can also just type in the word without a question mark, eg: \"ROPE\".</p>\n<p>I was also toying with the idea of a location using just one word in the description to start with. You learn more by asking questions that reveal important things in the room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T12:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a252e1b12e754b8d776f43501c8f54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chrishester"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
