Made in early 2018.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Playable prototype essentially (if you can even call it that). I actually had my HD die on me early 2019, so I no longer have the source but I happened to have a copy of the executable in my Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Uploaded via request for 8bitbartabas in an RPG Maker Discord :D</p>\n<p>EXE that runs in windows only.</p>\n<p>Instructions:<br/>- Unzip and play</p>\n<p>Controls<br/>A and D to move left and right<br/>SPACE to jump<br/>Mouse to Aim<br/>Mouse Left Click to shoot<br/>R to restart game</p>\n<p>Objective:<br/>- No real objective<br/>- But see if you can make it to the house (masochists only, game is not balanced)<br/>- Other than the 2 extra gun powerups, nothing is at the house<br/>- Every 100 ducks you kill also gives you an extra bullet, but it's in your best interest to get as far as you can as quickly as you can without having to rely on killing ducks<br/>- The game will lag when there are too many ducks in the level (lol)</p>\n<p>Music Licensed Under Creative Commons\u00a0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>The Singularity by Aussens@iter feat.
