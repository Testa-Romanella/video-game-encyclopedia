In preparation for this, they have\u00a0captured several battlegrade starships, but they lack the\u00a0essential power sources for these formidable crafts; Klystron\u00a0Pods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have been commissioned by the resistance to steal these\u00a0pods from the Empire's storage planets. Each planet is\u00a0defended by a battery of 'Limpet' guns, powered by a nuclear\u00a0power plan. By firing shots at the power plant, the guns can\u00a0be temporarily disabled; the more shots fired at the nuclear\u00a0reactor, the longer the guns will take to recharge.\u00a0BUT BEWARE!!! If you fire too many shots at the reactor, it\u00a0will become critical, giving you just ten seconds to clear the\u00a0planet before it is destroyed. If you have not already\u00a0retrieved the pod stored at that planet, then you will have\u00a0failed the mission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have retrieved the pod, and you manager to send the\u00a0reactor into its critical phase and leave the planet safely,you will recieve a hefty bonus.</p>\n<p>Further into the Empire's system, you will encounter planets\u00a0with REVERSE GRAVITY and something even more deadly...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right - rotate your ship</li><li>Up - Thrust</li><li>Space - Fire</li><li>S - Engage shield/refuel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T12:31:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/79628bf72f0c6c6adeb0f7c0ca81da63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Indigo Beetle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
