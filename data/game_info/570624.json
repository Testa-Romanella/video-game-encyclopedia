The two colors interwoven like water and fire are also a cage woven by logic. To break through this cage you need wisdom, patience, and love.</p>\n<p>Even if you choose the wrong option, it will not lead to game over. It is very suitable for casual players who like love reasoning but don't want to waste their brain cells.</p>\r\nSTAFF\r\n<ul><li>Scriptwriter: Trinidad Frozen</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Supervisor: dete_lynn</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Morgie CV: A Cun</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Miao Tian CV: Z Jun</li></ul>\n<ul><li>English Translation: Pan Zhen</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Russian Translation: Ilya Smirnov</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c4/8c4869de823d6559b421d8b8228238bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["zedraxlo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
