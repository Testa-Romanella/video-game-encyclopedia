This demo was not at all what I fully wanted to make as I came across time constraints and resolvable issues like a broken navmesh. Initially I wanted the workers to actually move and cause chaos, instead they just drop paper that causes chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Chaos being the limitation, I decided that all the paper would increase a 'chaos' level (the big number above the player), and that the player would have one minute (the smaller number) to 'chaotically' reduce it. Plus the boss throwing treats (which reduces chaos) I thought was chaotically hilarious (overused word much?).</p>\n<p>All in all I was more satisfied with the outcome as I built it, having to adapt to design issues and rethink how I was going to build this, It is experimental so do keep that in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Link to Repo:</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://github.com/Lebyfochs/MiniJam100-Clutterfuss</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time and I hope you guys enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5662103796cf5255126c115ec9eaebb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
