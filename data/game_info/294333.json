The possible points to be reached are displayed. By tapping on one of the hexagon fields, the Fled rotates 1 / 6th turn to the right. Each time you tap, the possible number of points is reduced by one.<br/><br/>If one or more red ribbons are reached, the result can be entered into a leaderboard (if it is one of your six best games) and the next level is started.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58a0b3375cf4a8720b5c8f969a25250b_FPR7I8y.jpg", "website": "http://www.gerhard.lentschik.at/apps.php?Funke=A1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Gerhard Lentschik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Gerhard Lentschik"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
