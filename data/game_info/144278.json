My vision was to evoke nostalgia for the\u00a0playful nature of childhood using\u00a0video game tropes I\u00a0grew up with across Nintendo platforms. I've always been inspired by their use of\u00a0colour, cel shading, sound so I\u00a0wanted to showcase these elements.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0wanted to connect this with the idea that everything is temporal and fleeting in life - places, people and memories. I hope\u00a0to induce emotions of <em>happiness</em> and <em>loss</em> at the same time, similar to how our brains can interpret memories.</p>\n<p>The use of real, intimate\u00a0moments from my life\u00a0contrasted with retro\u00a0colour and sound will hopefully leave the player with both of these emotions and provide an opportunity for reflection\u00a0on special moments in their own lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c444030622f669f172820467403787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vleonc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
