Is it about being\u00a0self-reliant? a\u00a0rejection of corporate branding in favor of DIYing it? or is it about doing things our way?\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is the embodiment of these ideals and more. Each art asset from music to sprites was custom done during the game jam. Instead of hosting it on a traditional ICANN domain, we decided to host it on a decentralized DNS project (Handshake\u00a0DNS). The gameplay itself is about exploring and making your own journey to the planets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Join the Jaynky community's discord server.</p>\r\n---Under Construction---\r\n<p><em>Explore a colorful solar system on (probably) the first game to be hosted on a domain using HDNS (Handshake DNS).
