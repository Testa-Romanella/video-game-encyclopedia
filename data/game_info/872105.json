(I chose theme 4 and i think i did all 3 bonus challange (maybe not the 2nd one))</p>\n<p>There isn't any supernatural\u00a0thing in this game, basic survival horror gameplay, you can crouch and jump and you need to stealth around. Playtime for all 8 endings i would say 30 mins, for 1 good-ish ending 5-10 mins.</p>\n\n<p>The zip is 125mb and the game is 250mb.</p>\n<p>Use WASD, Left CTRL, and Space Bar for movement (crouch is hold), E/LMB to interact.</p>\n\n<p>V1.1: Main Menu UI scales with resolution, also the robber gave back the T to the title.</p>\n<p>V1.4: added progress tracker, made AI detection not be Linear (y=x*x now), and made detection be frame independent, removed some useless faces and fixed tiny stuff, and \"removed\" that one ending.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T11:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1dc2541141964ab097006f8400af24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HandsomelessKing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
