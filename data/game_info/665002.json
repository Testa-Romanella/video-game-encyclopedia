Unique lighting mechanics like you've never seen before are the main reason you'll want this game to never end.<br/><br/><h3>It's a platformer</h3>Oldschool game brought back to life. Simple yet challenging gameplay full of variety and possibilities. Use the light and the darkness, the floor and the walls and combos of all kinds to overcome anything that stands in your way and beat your time.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Let there be light</h3>Be careful for you never know what is hiding in the night. The whole map is drowning in black darkness and without the help of gentle butterflies and amical moths it is nearly impossible to survive - but be careful who you trust and never stop exploring!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Be the fastest!</h3>Can you beat the stopwatch? Running to the finish line in a decent time is a challenge; only the bravest Lightbringers are capable of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>What are you still waiting for? There is still so much darkness left to uncover!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T03:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c850055e2ad314c48560c6c54c31e08.jpg", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/padanigames/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Padani games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Padani Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
