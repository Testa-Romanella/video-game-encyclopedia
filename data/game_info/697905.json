The guy who beats them all, right? Nah! Somehow you're not convincing me at all. Not everyone has what it takes. Maybe you should just go back home and save yourself the disappointment...</p>\n<p>Well, obviously you're still here. So just get in that odd box and then we'll shoot you to the moon! But don't say I didn't warn you! This is your last chance to get out of here in one piece! This high-speed shit is absolutely addictive. Okay, I told you...</p><p>I hope you had some sperm frozen. The strong magnets are supposed to make impotent.... Hehehe!</p>\n<p>And now show me what you've got!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li><strong>W / UP</strong> = Magnet Inversion*</li><li><strong>A / LEFT</strong> = Move Left</li><li><strong>D / RIGHT</strong> = Move right</li></ul><p>*this inverts the magnet that keeps you at the track, so it's pushing you away. The steering then automatically rolls you by 180 degrees and then the magnet is activated again. The HUD has two circles with sensor information. The outermost is the current data where the vehicle is at the moment, while the innermost is an estimation of the vehicles landing position after a magnet inversion jump.<br/></p><p><strong>---=== Goal / End of Game ===----</strong></p><p>There is no final end of the Game at the moment. But, try to pass 3 rounds of that level, while the speed increases. A score of 3000 should be doable.<br/></p><p><strong>---=== The Credits ===---<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Programming, Level Design &amp; Most Sound Effects by SDwarfs<br/></strong>I also do Music.
