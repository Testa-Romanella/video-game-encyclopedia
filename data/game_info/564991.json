Make the robots shoot each other while bending time with your amazing movement skills!</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Your timer constantly increases but the faster you move the slower it increments. You start off with an assault rifle but every wave you kill the enemies, your weapon gets worse. After all waves are done you receive your final score. The player cannot die, but every time your health bar goes to 0 you receive a 60-second penalty. The only way to heal is to move fast and the faster you move the more you heal.</p>\n<p>Movement in Svante is a bit different from other games. The longer you are above the ground the faster your maximum movement is. When you turn your momentum turns with you. This means that you can do a 180 and now you are moving in the opposite direction keeping all the momentum. When you touch the ground your max speed drastically decreases but if you are fast enough you can keep most of your momentum.</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>This game was made in 3 days for the Wowie Game Jam 3.0 as a solo dev so that's the reason part of the assets were made by others.</p>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Move: WASD</li><li>Reload: R</li><li>Shoot: L CLICK</li><li>Jump: Space</li><li>Pause: Esc</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>SFX: Kenney.nl &amp;\u00a0Generated from sfxr</li><li>Wall Texture: CC0Textures</li><li>BG Song:\u00a0\u60b2\u3057\u3044 ANDROID - APARTMENT</li><li>Weapons: Quaternius</li><li>Other Models: Me</li><li>Code: Me</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:07:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d8/7d83e9df00954cee4692b870e109a943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Affax"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
