He has been left home alone while his parents go off haunting for the night. Mr and Mrs Klevin have trusted Klevin to look after the house.</p>\n<p>Ghosts hate light! So when Klevin's night was disrupted by a bunch of kids ghost-hunting, he is tasked with staying hidden and escaping the house!</p>\n<p>Use Klevin's ghost powers to evade the invaders. You can turn invisible and invisible to light, but be careful, you can only do this for a limited amount of time, after which you are completely vulnerable to kids flashlights! Klevin knows his house well and is able to slip in and out of the vents at will to avoid running into the light.</p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Space bar to turn invisible</p>\n<p>Left click to interact with skulls, vents, and doors</p>\n<p>Esc for pause menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/304ebb01fa4126f5135c2e5aa4c21a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["code-fletcher"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
