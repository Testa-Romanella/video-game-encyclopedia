This game was made for the Game Makers Toolkit Jam 2018 under the theme \"A walking simulator without being boring.\" It is different than any other game I have ever made and was quite the challenge. Unfortunately I\u00a0didn't get to tie off every narrative path with a nice little bow, but I\u00a0believe I\u00a0accomplished a lot more than I thought was possible. I plan to work on this game a bit more in the future to tie off those loose ends and practice my polishing ability.</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any and all feedback: gg@auburn.edu</p>\n<p>My portfolio: ChristianGraham.org\u00a0-- Always on the lookout for an internship in the games industry ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMzAwMDMwLzE0Njc4ODkucG5n/original/Y9w1OX.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChristianPhD"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
