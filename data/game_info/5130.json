Bach. The elegant game play is both addictive and easy to grasp but infused with the explosive potential to challenge your control skills with 30 solo Missions, survival-style Arcade mode, speed challenge Score Attack, or Vs. mode for local player-to-player competition. At the game&#39;s core are Fusion Blocks and Energy Orbs, which annihilate each other with a burst of energy when matching colors touch. Strategically combining Fusion Blocks into massive structures then linking the blocks to a string of like-colored Energy Orbs will ignite a chain reaction of nuclear proportions and super scores. The fusion of energy, music and compelling game play are sure to keep puzzle players plugged into Kurulin Fusion\u2122 for hours on end.<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
