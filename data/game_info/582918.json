Most is avoiding obstacles which is hard especially near the end. I wasn't really sure what to name fully but I thought about calling it Impossible Climb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The style of the game is basic at the moment due to limitations as well as learning to make games still. Also I'm not sure what genre it is fully but I thought maybe a platformer style.</p>\n<p>Feel free to try it out and let me know how the game goes. Enjoy and have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a33fdf1a2cd0994dcce6eb71e3de7f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeakGaming"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
