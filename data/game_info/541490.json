I mixed together the puzzle, simulation, and sandbox genres to create a little playground for people to play in. There is no objective, just to move around and explore the small galaxy. There could be an objective in the future, and this can be expanded, but for now it's just a little sandbox galaxy.</p>\n<p>The project was created using Unity and VS Code for development, Photoshop for art, as well as\u00a0MuseScore/Audacity for music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d26e5dd61d6cc2f3f11e4ee6d5bdef1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SkyMocha"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
