(Linux build still not available yet, I will create one as soon as possible)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>\n<p>It is the year 20XX, a time where an anomaly happened above the sky, it is now crumbling. asteroids starts to fall that crumble into giant eyeballs (for some reason...) starts invading the land of civilization. But fear not, the space ship is here to defend ground form the falling sky above for ... well as long as you can... there is no victory for you.</p>\n<p>This is a game made for the 2-Buttons Jam 2020. The theme I choose is \"Crumble\".\u00a0It is a space invaders style shmup where you will have to defend a city from the sky crumbling above.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Falling is an arcade style game where you control a ship with only 2 buttons, you can shoot, dash, shotgun blast, deflect bullets and many more with just a 2 button control scheme. The controls are simple but it quite a bit of depth to it, especially if you are playing for score. There is a high score and a basic scoring system in the game if you wan to show of your gamer skills or play however you like. We don't care. The game and controls might take some time to get used to but don't worry as each play session are quick (unless you are that good, I guess) so some messing around is also encouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Programming, Art, Game Design : </strong>Iced_Lemon -&gt; https://twitter.com/Iced_Lemon_Draw</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/> <strong>Soundtrack:\u00a0</strong><br/> Visager -&gt; https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/<ul><li>End Credits -&gt; https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_...</li><li>We Can Do It -&gt; https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_...</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li> <strong>Sounds:\u00a0</strong><br/> for various sound effects, some used with modifications:<br/> LittleRobotSoundFactory -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/16681/?page=3#sound<br/> - Explosion_02<br/> - Hit_02_Wav\u00a0<br/> - Explosion_01<ul><li>coolguy244e -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/coolguy244e/<ul><li>Door slam - Gun shot</li></ul></li><li>pepingrillin -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/pepingrillin/<ul><li>electro_fly.ogg</li></ul></li><li>Erokia -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/Erokia/<ul><li>30-30 Lever Rifle Gunshot 2.wav</li></ul></li><li>Bird_man -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/Bird_man/<ul><li>Gun Shot.wav</li></ul></li><li>Joao_Janz -&gt; https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/<ul><li>Bouncing Power Up 1_3</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Play Testers</strong><ul><li>NickStick</li><li>\u00a0AirVent</li><li>\u00a0Fish Chai</li><li>\u00a0Chi Sin</li><li>\u00a0lapspider45</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Inspirations</strong><ul><li>Monolith: After the End -&gt; Team D-13</li></ul><ul><li>Downwell -&gt; Moppin</li></ul><ul><li>Cave Story -&gt; Pixel\u00a0</li><li>Switch 'N' Shoot -&gt; Matt Glanville</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for playing and I hope you enjoy the game.
