These lands are known for their holy, and light based races, and also for their dazzling environments.</p>\n<p> <em><strong>Resolum</strong></em>: Served under the Defender of Balance, Ellia. These lands are home to neutral based races, and are also full of life in both plants and animals.</p>\n<p> <em><strong>Devii Ral</strong></em>: Served under the Dark God, Deval. These lands are known for their dark, and demonic based races, and are mostly covered by ashen clouds from a giant volcano, making the areas fairly dark even in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p> <strong><em>Neutral</em></strong>: Areas that serve no god predominantly.</p>\n<p><strong> Regions:</strong></p>\n<p>At present day, after the War of Echoes ended, the nations and regions were left as they were for now, having world focus more on restoring the broken lands and people.</p>\n<p><strong> Major Locations:</strong></p>\n<p>Key locations that are specific to the world, mainly consisting of the capital cities of each nation.</p>\n<p><strong> Minor Locations:</strong></p>\n<p>Key locations that are relevant to characters specifically, and not necessarily important to the world as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong> Eclipse Seal:</strong></p>\n<p>The areas of land that were sealed in the Sun and Moon Prisons during the Age of Harmony because of Ellia and the eclipse.</p>\n<p><strong>Artist Commentary:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wys:</em></p>\n<p>Coming up with so many regions is a pain, all these names, so glad it's a collab, but the descriptions are a breeze to work with huehuhe death trap land everywhere BD *slapped * jk. Gotta give it ta Aeal to prettify it with interactive code magic ahah if ya stuck with me you'd be getting a glorified png</p>\n<p>My point still stands that Aeal is a pretty pancake programing wizard, changing all that flash to HTML, sorry that I can only help with the data conversion of some of the stuff AHAHAH<br/></p>\n<p><em>Aeal:</em></p>\n<p>UUUUUUGH this took foreeeeever to code =A= freaking 100+ chunks of code for each region just to get the hover function to work, and then having to adjust it at the end to get another function to work. |D worth it in the end though. Wys was the one that did 99% of the region descriptions too X'D Which is great because I was mind failing at all of that. Yay Aeon 8'D This was probably my biggest coding project yet X'D Which was fun but also infuriating at the same time |D Why do people only have help for AS3 from back in 2012 or the likes. |D And it's always using flash too and not flashdevelop....... Yeaaah. &gt;v&gt; boodoop, I'm done. X'DDD This took a liiitle over a month to do from start to end, so better enjoy it.<br/></p>\n<p>I had to port this over to HTML after flash died 8 |. Which was fun but also annoying because I had to learn <em>another</em> programming language. Also had to modify the way the region descriptions pop up so it was cleaner, but at least it loads faster now, yeeeey~</p>\n\n<p>Trinity\u00a0log\u00a0(c)\u00a0Dragoonwys\u00a0&amp;\u00a0AealZX<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88c/88ce8f56b9a8a21e012496b0f872c5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dragoonwys"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
