Remain cautious, however: the more you mutate your specimens, the greater their speed and aggression...\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0WASD to move. E to open doors.\u00a0Left-Click to HURT an animal <em>(this will pacify them if they get angry and run at you!</em><em>).</em>\u00a0Right-Click to select two animals, and then\u00a0press F to FUSE them together<em>\u00a0(mutated animals means more money!).</em></p>\n<p>Going up to the Shopkeeper will open up his store. I recommend starting by buying 1 or 2 Turkeys.</p>\n<p><strong>Fusions:</strong> Only certain animals can be FUSED together.\u00a0<br/>Tarantula + Turkey.\u00a0<br/>Elephant + Koala.\u00a0<br/>Whale + Llama.<br/>Porcupine + Rhino.<br/>Taranturkey + Koalaphant.\u00a0<br/>Porcuphrino + Whallama.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Aggression Chance:</strong> <br/>Green = 5% chance to attack you every 10 seconds. <br/>Yellow = 15%. <br/>Red = 25%.</p>\n<p><strong>Shooting Passive Animals:</strong> If you shoot a passive animal, everyone else will have their own aggression increased by 5%! Make sure to only shoot animals when they are angry! (doing this will reset their aggression to the normal rate)</p>\n<p><strong>Made for the SA Game Jam 2021 by 3rd-year Vega Durban student Kenton Leslie-Smith.
