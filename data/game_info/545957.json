They both covet and fear you, because you are perfection incarnate. A shape with only one side, that loops around infinitely. You must die.</p>\n<p>The features: An entirely original concept (as much as shooters can be original), a custom soundtrack (currently made of two songs) and neon art.</p>\n<p>The controls: Use the arrow keys or WASD to move, the mouse to shoot and Enter to select options.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal: This is my first true game and this is all new to me. The goal is to take this buggy, unfinished piece of code and turn it into something fun to play. I have plans for many things, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Complex enemies made of multiple shapes</li><li>An evolution system</li><li>An arena that changes with every wave</li><li>A dynamic background</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54bdf8b95a178567785f4ad855896480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bochinator"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
