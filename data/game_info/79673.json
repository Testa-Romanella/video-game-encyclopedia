You can guess what you'll find in Trendy Town or Totaltoys District, for example!<br/><br/>The product line-up at your store is up to you, of course. Will you be selling model toys, video games, classy suits, cars, plasma TVs, or diamonds? That's the fun in the second-hand retail industry -- you sell all sorts of goods, cherry-picked from a variety of available pre-owned products.<br/><br/>Your store also offers a gift-wrapping service which does wonders for boosting customer satisfaction.<br/><br/>Besides store shelves, you can also have stalls selling donuts or ice-cream, a gaming corner or toy vending machine. They'll draw in more customers, and once your store becomes really popular, even whole groups of kids or curious tourists.<br/><br/>Your field staff are in charge of collecting goods for sale. They'll sometimes come across what looks like real treasure, but you'll have to appraise it first to see what it's actually worth. You may discover some amazing items this way, which will bring fame to your store!<br/><br/>Fully exploring every town and finding all available products is a real challenge...
