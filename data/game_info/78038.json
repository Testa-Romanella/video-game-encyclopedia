Oh wait, hang on... no that's not the first rule. <br/><br/>In fact, it's actually the total opposite. <br/><br/>DO talk about Botty McBotman. Talk to as many people as you can! <br/><br/>For each friend that you invite to play Botty McBotman, three magical things will happen:<br/><br/>1. That friend will become a character in your game and join your team of bots! Woo hoo!<br/>2. You'll become a character in their game! Cool.<br/>3. A pet unicorn will arrive at your door in 3-5 working days. Life-changing! <br/><br/>*Please note that only 2 of the above points are completely true. Unicorns do not make good pets, trust me. It's all about them and they sure do know it.<br/><br/>So tell all of your friends, families, enemies, teachers and pets, but not STRANGERS - never talk to those, especially the ones with (\u2299~\u2299 ) beady eyes. <br/><br/>The second rule of Botty McBotman is \u2014 HAVE FUN. This is quite serious, you must have fun or else, what's the point? Wow... I went a bit deep there.
