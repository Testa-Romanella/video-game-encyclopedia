However, the Scratch version still runs gloriously. But, if you want that PC game experience then the itch.io version is the way to go. Stats will be saved every time you click the \"Green Flag\" when the after action report shows. </strong><strong>The big caveat is if you close the client all the stats will be erased, due to the fact that the .exe file is not under the scratch cloud.</strong><strong> For future versions I will see if there is a way to create a work around to save stats permanently.
