Your boss, like many other times, has commissioned you with this investigation thinking that it was just another case, that it was not going to amount to anything, as always. But as soon as you dig into it you realize that could not be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>Go slowly into the office, open doors, collect keys and discover the secret behind YUM.</p>\n<p>This game was developed by 6 Engineering students for a 7 month project. Everything was done by ourselves, from the whole graphic and sound motor to the software architecture, using opengl and fmod. All done in c++.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What we are trying to show you here is a brief demo of what we initially wanted to do. At the start we were inspired by the backrooms and the idea kept growing until we had our own game concept. Due to having to learn many technologies and the many difficulties that come with that the story was left behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would love to make our original idea with a proper graphic motor such as Unreal so make sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments. In case we see a lot of support or interest in it we might do it. And if you find any bugs let us now.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and enjoy ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d3a544d3dce7e5bdc70f90fe38a48b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Last Station"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
