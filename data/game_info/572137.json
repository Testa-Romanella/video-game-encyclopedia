After a century long war, your ancestors defeated him, breaking free of their chains and tasting freedom for the first time in generations. The Devourer was not destroyed however, too great was his power, but a Labyrinth orbiting the star of your system was constructed to house his sleeping spirit. Those bound within time however can not permanently chain the timeless, and your ancestors knew that shackles forged by mortal hands would need mortal upkeep. They foresaw that their chains would last 1000 years, after which three mortals would be required to venture into the Labyrinth and renew them over the course of a century.</p>\n<p>It is 1000 years later, and The Devourer has been dreaming. The need for renewal is becoming apparent, as The Devourer's slumber wanes, evil forces have been growing in strength throughout the system. You have been selected to take part in the first stage of the renewal, and the future of your people goes with you.</p>\n<p>An action roguelike set in space, and filled with destructible terrain, speeding projectiles and explosive arnaments. Almost bullet hellish.</p>\n<p><strong>Made for 7DRL2021 using L\u00f6ve2d.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Software used: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>L\u00f6ve2d</li><li>notepad++</li><li>paint.net</li><li>audacity</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you to the fantastic users of freesounds for their great audio.
