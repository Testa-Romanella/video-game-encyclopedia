There are a few identified bugs in this version that might result in a crash of the game. To avoid them, avoid selecting a box that doesn't have a script attached to it, and do not press Tab during the introductory dialogue or during the credits. This is a beta, so these bugs will be resolved in future versions.\u00a0We hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Gamebois (Abla Ghaleb, Lexi Stein, June Burkle, and Elena Felix)</p>\n<p>P.S.
