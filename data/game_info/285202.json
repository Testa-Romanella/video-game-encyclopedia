Velocirection here with something new... and not safe for work. Take a moment to relax in my wonderful palace! I decorated it myself!</p>\n\r\n#WARNING#\r\n<p>THIS GAME CONTAINS <em><strong>100% GAY CONTENT!</strong>\u00a0</em><em>ONLY PLAY IF YOU'RE A TRUE <strong>GAYMURR</strong></em></p>\r\n-Controls-\r\n<p>Mouse to move cursor.</p>\n<p>Left Mouse to click on things.</p>\r\n-Controls in mini-game-\r\n\n<p>WASD to\u00a0move.</p>\n<p>Mouse to aim.</p>\n<p>Left mouse to shoot.</p>\n\r\nFAQ\r\n<p><strong><em>What's this all about??? What about Gator or Zebra!?</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is a short \"Game Snack\" I made because I was getting a lot of people telling me they were looking forward to more of Gator Or Zebra and looking forward to the NSFW stuff. Since Day 2 is taking a bit(but I think it'll be worth the wait) I made a stand alone experience that has plenty of yiffy stuff you degenerates(like me ;3) love.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't really plan on making this but since the demo of GoZ got such a positive response(thank you everyone :3) and since I was dying to make filthy smut... I decided to do this.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Will Velocirection's Pad be a place\u00a0in Gator Or Zebra?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Maybe :3 You'll be able to see Velocirection again in Gator Or Zebra but maybe not go to Velocirection's Pad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ha, gaaaaaayyy!</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah :3</p>\n\n<p><strong>As with Gator or Zebra, the font...</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Is the font from Illusion of Gaia and you can download it here. Thanks to\u00a0Codeman38!</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/lunchtime-doubly-so.font</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's up with the file size?</strong></p>\n<p>The current download is a version of the game that contains all assets for Gator or Zebra up to this point(music, graphics, day two stuff, etc...) as well as stuff for this game. If the file size is an issue, I'll make a trimmed down version!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you feel like supporting Pizzass Games financially...</strong></p>\n<p>You just playing the game is a huge reward to me on it's own. But I'd love to spend more time making sexy games and if you decided to give me any amount of money, be it buying the game here on Itch or becoming a patron of Pizzass Games, it would make my day and bring me closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Remember, it's <strong><em>optional</em></strong>- you see, I'm a crazy person and simply can't quite game development. So either way I'll still be making games/yiff/whatever else. But with enough support, I could spend more time making stuff like this instead of working a stupid, not sexy job. :3</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/velocirection<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T03:57:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b8/5b8948217e69bd84d23b1bba539c4cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["velocirection"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
