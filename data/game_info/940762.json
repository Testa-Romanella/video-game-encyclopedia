In this page, The game\u2122 will be refered to as: <strong>The game</strong>.</p>\n<p>It was very hard to lose the datas from <strong>The game</strong>. I tried to joke about it but it was painful. It wasn't a big game, but it was something I cared about.</p>\n\n<p>In this page, the thief will be refered to as : <strong><em>The thief</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the computer got stolen, I knew I had an old backup on an old hard-drive. I'm not very good at planning things and backing-up datas. I should have made more saves, online saves, should have used versionning etc.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the backup\u00a0was at least\u00a06 months old,<br/>if it existed. <br/>If the hard-drive worked. <br/>Maybe even <strong>The game</strong> was perectly fine and I backed it up 2 days before <strong><em>The thief</em></strong> took it.<br/> <br/>I didn't remember.<br/>So I didn't look. Because I was scared to look.</p>\n<p>This game is a backup of <strong>The game</strong>. I added a few things, fixed a few blocking bugs. It lacks content but it gives you a good idea of what <strong>The game</strong> could have been. Not a big game, not a great game, just <strong>The game</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<br/>\n<p><strong>The game</strong> consists of a series of glitchy screens that lets you interact with them. You can\u00a0\"go out of screen\" to go to the next screen. It's a sort of interractive videoclip of a song I made about trashgames in 2017. <strong>The game</strong> would adapt the amount of screen shown depending on how fast you go through them so that you would end your playthrough at the end of the song. This backup doesn't really do that.</p>\n<p>Each screen was then supposed to become a playable stand-alone micro-game (1-2minutes for most) of various genre. The playable clip would be free, on browser. Supporting <strong>The game</strong> on itch would let you access each screen individually with special gameplay and goals.</p>\n<p>I also wanted\u00a0to add one more microgames to the zip file. I planned to add one or update one\u00a0each time someone supported the game on itch.io.<br/></p>\n<p>The backup I recovered only containted\u00a0files from the interractive clip. I have no datas from the 15+ individual micro-games. <strong><em>The thief</em></strong> is free to play those in their free time, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For anyone who wants to support this weird thing,\u00a0I developped a new microgame for this back-up version. Don't expect anything big or polished, though. But I had fun making it.\u00a0I also uploaded the song and another old song.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a5d92603e739ed6a22a54491268a20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rando-Malo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
