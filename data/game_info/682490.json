Anastasov is a master of painting, flying, unusual art forms, and the ever present quest for possible meanings. Drawing on his interests in art and history and his passion for history, Outhouse Media aims to create an ironic narrative set in the realm of games.\n\nAnd as the video game industry has exploded over the last few years, Anastasov's career has also exploded.\n\nHe's already created 3 titles in $100 games: Letter from the Producer, 'A Black Market', and the first video game to be created with the Unreal Engine 4. His latest take on the Assassin's Creed franchise is called 'Assassin's Creed Revelations', and it's due to launch later this year. Anastasov built his name creating games all over the globe, from Little Inferno, where they made rules for the new (non-Puchi) FIFA 16 game, to building realistic battle scenes for the Unreal Tournament series.\n\nBut Anastasov is the real star of the show. He has also made the short-lived satirical short 'Honourable Leader' for the kids, which he presented in Sputnik 21.\n\nIt's a silly little game, but it's a charming little show.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/790/7907a3897f8cbd59f98383ab74ba7aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
