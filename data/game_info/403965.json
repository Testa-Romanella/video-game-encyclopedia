You also can leave the levels and play the classic game where you need to escape from balls as many time as you can.\u00a0 we added also simpler difficulties for the levels so even if you feel that you can't complete the original one's, you still will be able to 'taste' out our project.</p>\n<p>New levels and version of our project will come depends on how many people liked it, so if you enjoyed playing it, the game was too easy or hard, leave a comment below.</p>\n<p>Enjoy BadBalls :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b92459fbb10f4c1389169e45a88bfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vipnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
