It\u2019s a base building game where players must build spaceships from the ground up tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in a self-built haven among the stars.<br />\nSpace Haven allows for a lot of freedom regarding building. A functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!<br />\nSpace Haven\u2019s core is built around the isometric tile-based gas system, which simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on a spaceship. The gas system combined with humans, plants and facilities all having their own reactions to gas levels create deep and emergent game play. When designing and building a spaceship, you need to secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think about possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. Gas conditions can be monitored using different view modes.<br />\nThe game simulates needs, moods, and relationships of crew members. Each crew member has their own history of life before the apocalypse, their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how. Crew members will develop relationships with each other, good or bad. They will want to spend more time with some, while avoiding others. Witness depression, happiness and drama surrounding different crew members as you journey onward towards a new home.<br />\nExplore a new randomly generated galaxy with your crew each time you start a new adventure. Throughout your venture your crew will meet other groups of humans escaping earth, as well as established factions looking to survive or take control of the galaxy. Trade, negotiate or attack. Navigate the star map and seek out resources to keep your crew alive and expand your spaceship.<br />\nYour crew will have encounters with an alien race, often hiding in the shadows of a derelict ship. These aliens are capable of abducting your crew members and dragging them to their base. Will you try to save them or leave them behind?<br />\nCool things that can happen in Space Haven:<br />\nGain a new crew member by finding a hypersleep pod aboard a derelict ship.<br />\nHave a space burial for your fallen crew member to let other crew members say good bye.<br />\nGrow plants with bio mass and water recycled from toilets.<br />\nEat the meat from a fallen crew member or invader as desperation is high.<br />\nWatch aliens capture your crew member and plaster him to a wall in their base. Will you go save him or leave him there?<br />\nWishlist and follow now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a79034d132c8c6427bfa0bf9b25b406c.jpg", "website": "http://bugbyte.fi/spacehaven/", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 389, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 16, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 475, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bugbyte"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bugbyte"], "esrb_rating": null}
