You have a dog which can assist you in this task. You move the mower with the arrow keys on your keyboard, and the SPACE bar is your dog button (hold it down to set the dog on the nearest bad guy).</p>\n<p>You can complete levels by just doing that, but in order to have the most fun and score the most points per level, you'll want to be slicing the heads off moles, deliberately running amok through the flowerbeds to upset the gardener (and, if you're really thorough, the police), incurring the wrath of the local vet, playing fetch with the dog and trying not to step in dog poo, all the while hoping to acquire as large a flock of sheepies as you can.</p>\n\r\nGo ahead and throw that garden furniture at your neighbour.\r\n<p>You can find an unnervingly thorough strategy guide for it all here. Ignore all the crap about iPaqs obviously. Just use the arrow keys and SPACE to dog. When starting the game you'll need to use the mouse to select the game options because I was too lazy to properly implement the keyboard in the UI.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are four neighbours whose Flymos you can TWOC, and it's up to you to cause as much mayhem as you can across the levels using those.</p>\n\r\nThe game features some truly crappy artwork.\r\n<p>The game features some truly crappy programmer artwork, and in lieu of a proper musician has a recording of me singing the theme music badly. Triple A this ain't. Nonetheless if you give it a go you might get a bit of silly British fun out of it, and lordy knows we all need a bit of that eh. And hey, the price is right.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/0445377b00991fa02973fa76a3e2cc6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llamasoft_ox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
