Developed by the creators of Relic Hunters Zero, Chroma Squad and Dungeonland! \n<br/><br/>\nStar Vikings was designed for people who miss casual games from a time before \u201cfree to play\u201d and microtransactions, when quality, fun and accessibility came before \u201cmonetization\u201d! \n<br/><br/>\nHow does it play? \n<br/><br/>\nIt's a bit hard to describe, so check the video. But imagine a \"reverse Plants vs. Zombies\" where you are attacking instead of defending. And instead of zombies you have Vikings who can level up, acquire new skills and gear! \n<br/><br/>\nStar Vikings has a completely unique gameplay, is packed full of content, and will turn even your non-gamer grandma into a hardcore min-maxing machine by the time the credits roll. Unique Puzzle/RPG gameplay based on teamwork and chain reactions; \n6-8 hour Story mode packed with colorful characters and dialog; \nEquip and level up your crew of up to 5 Vikings; \nChoose between six classes with unique skills; \nProcedurally-generated puzzles for endless replayability; \n\u201cEndgame\u201d system with Leaderboards - compete with your friends! (mode unlocks only later in the game) \nSecret levels and \u201cfunny\u201d jokes!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T14:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/5251ba83b18e71204f66520cdf2c59bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 102, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rogue Snail"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Akupara Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
