{"id": 422750, "slug": "downhill-widdershin", "name": "Downhill (Widdershin)", "name_original": "Downhill (Widdershin)", "description": "<p>Downhill is the fastest skateboarding game you've ever played.</p>\n<p>Made by skaters for skaters, Downhill aims to provide the essential hill bombing experience in a video game format.<br/></p>\n<p>Downhill is in early alpha, but while there may be bugs and other rough edges, the core gameplay is there. Right now, you can test your skating skills across three extreme maps. There is a detailed control system that allows you to tuck and slide to your heart's content.</p>\n<p>Downhill requires a controller to play, and supports up to four players splitscreen locally. Simply connect a controller and hit a button and you'll join the game.</p>\n<p>Depending on how well the alpha sells, I hope to develop this game further and add:</p>\n<ul><li>Online Multiplayer</li><li>Customizable boards and outfits</li><li>Races (locally and online)</li><li>A more natural procedural animation system</li><li>Other features the community wants to see!</li></ul>\n<p>In future, I want to shift to a free to play model where players can pay for optional cosmetics, like rare gear or designs for their leathers. This is because I want to support this game for a long time, and it's easier to do that if there is regular income available.</p>\n<p>While the game is in early access, anyone who buys will unlock a special Founder status for your account. This will show up on your account, and once cosmetics have been added to the game you will receive a special rare item that won't be obtainable any other way.</p>\n<p>The first hundred people to purchase the game will also receive the OG status for your account. When cosmetics have been added to the game, you will receive a gold OG patch for your leathers.<br/></p>\n<p>Finally, if you are super excited about this game or try it out and love what it could be, please consider funding more than the default amount. I am using this early access period to fund development, so the more the community puts down the more features and content I can add to the game.<br/><br/>I will definitely set up reward tiers for higher contributions in future, but I want feedback from the community first on what they'd like most as a reward.<br/><br/><strong>Downhill requires a controller to play, like a PS4 or Xbox controller.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/7156af2701afd54348229cdaab2c282c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Widdershin"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
