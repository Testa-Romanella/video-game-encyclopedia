When I came home and powered it on, I discovered that the previous owner never wiped it and I found some old debug files for a game called diamond_digger.exe. The game's playable but is clearly incomplete and will sometimes crash. Every time I complete level 5 I encounter glitches and other strange.... oddities which are preventing me from progressing further and completing the game. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the laptop, or the game itself. If any of you fine gaming enthusiasts could download the game and complete it for me, and tell me what happens, I would be most grateful.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T07:58:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16d5e16159e4ecb86db04828b64e9891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quantum Cube Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
