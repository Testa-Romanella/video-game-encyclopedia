For example, if you play with 2 players, only 1 player can reach the goal, but if you play with 10 players, up to 3 players can reach the goal. The game ends when the specified number of players have reached the goal, and the player who has reached the goal wins the game and the player who has not reached the goal loses the game.<br/>\r\nIf your robot is destroyed by an attack from another robot or by a trap set in the ruins, you can challenge the labyrinth again from the starting point.<br/>\r\nRobots can form alliances with the consent of each other. Only one robot can be in an alliance at a time.<br/>\r\nAllied robots cannot attack each other, and the reward at the finish line will be divided between them.<br/>\r\nAn alliance can be broken unilaterally, but the other party will not be notified of the breaking of the alliance and will remain in the same state as if it were still an alliance.<br/>\r\nFor example, if A unilaterally breaks an alliance with B, A can form a new alliance with another robot, but B cannot attack A until he breaks the alliance himself, and the reward will be split between A and B when B reaches the goal.<br/>\r\nIf both players in the alliance reach the goal, a bonus is added to the reward.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAttention.<br/>\r\nThis game is not a random match, but only password matching. We encourage you to invite your friends and go explore these unknown ruins!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T03:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a23d8060dd4353d347d9491f8de4577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fortgs"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fortgs"], "esrb_rating": null}
