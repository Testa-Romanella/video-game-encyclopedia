As you play more levels, the time you get as well as the numbers you have to manage get significantly tougher, on level 5 you only have 20 seconds!\u00a0The graphics style is heavily inspired by papers please. Game's pretty unpolished but it's my first game jam so I'm pretty happy with it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T15:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d8da9cfa7601fed1c650814c4c546b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["frizuo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
