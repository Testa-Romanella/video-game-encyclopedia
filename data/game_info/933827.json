Survives sprites look rushed and not even close to what the guns looked like, and no updates whatsoever after HolySkullStudios tried making Multiplayer, which never worked. They just abandoned the project and holyboi12 left the team, leaving AnimeKid567147, becoming SkullyGames, and now here he is again remaking Survive, holyboi12 joined back into the team helping him, making them now both SkullyGames.
