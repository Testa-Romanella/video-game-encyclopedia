{"id": 613643, "slug": "backslash-slash", "name": "Backslash, Slash", "name_original": "Backslash, Slash", "description": "<p><em>Backslash, Slash</em>\u00a0is a 3D Game developed in\u00a0Unity URP\u00a0for the\u00a048+8 2021\u00a0Game Jam. Players perform melee combos by pressing keys in unique sequences to grind out points, progress through levels, and upgrade their gear. The main goal is to chain together combos to deal massive damage and play satisfying animations!</p>\n<p>Click here to view the GitHub repository!</p>\n<p><strong>Connection to Game Jam Theme:</strong></p>\n<p>\"The theme is\u00a0<strong>Butterfly</strong>. There's a lot of idioms, puns, phenomenon, and objects which incorporate \"butterfly\" in some way. All of those interpretations are allowed. Have fun with it!\"</p>\n<p>Upon reading this theme, we decided to focus on a famous and ultra-cool weapon: the Butterfly Knife! Because of Muhammad Ali\u2019s iconic quote \u201cFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee\u201d, we also decided to add punching and kicking into the game as an homage to martial arts. We also incorporated the theme by naming different levels after butterfly species, and changing the dummy colour to match the colour of these species. Finally, we added a secret easter egg which definitely connects to the theme ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>The game opens with the Main Menu, where the player pushes\u00a0\\\u00a0and\u00a0/\u00a0to start the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player is walked through the basics of the controls with a tutorial. During this time, the player will learn how to perform their first combo, how combo mechanics work, and how to navigate the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>By successfully performing combos, the player increases their damage multiplier. This will allow them to progress through levels and earn points (Nectar) more quickly. The player can use their points in the Shop to upgrade their knife, purchase a different type of knife, or purchase an elemental damage upgrade.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses through the levels, instructions on how to perform new combos will be revealed in the Combos menu. Certain combos have unique bonuses which activate when they are performed.</p>\n<p>Using upgraded gear and a knowledge of combinations, the player can stack damage to ludicrous levels. Attacking a ragdoll dummy has never been so satisfying!</p>\n<p><strong>Creators:<br/></strong><em>Backslash, Slash\u00a0</em>was created by two high school students:<br/><br/>- Justin Lin</p>\n<p>- Yax\u00a0Patel</p>\r\nWe would like to thank the organizers of the 48 + 8 game jam for a fun and unique opportunity!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T03:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3d/e3d31b1a91511bb0e16e7c3f88e3e91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinLin905"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
