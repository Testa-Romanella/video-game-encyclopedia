This is so you don't get stuck in the game. Will correct this and other areas after the game jam (Can't change now due to rules ;) )</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T22:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63ca36782ac521529a63bcbe501c915a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cosmic Cat Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
