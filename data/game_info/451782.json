The game is centred around two players in kayaks and the goal is to reach the end, preferably together. Along the way you can collect Lifebuoys to add to your score and paddles to boost. Boosting simultaneously with good timing will ensure you are both able to reach the end together. If you lag behind, you will be \u201ckilled\u201d. Working together is vital so that you can both succeed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T02:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/2692231c10f83ea1559cb01d4da6db5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron & Joe"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
