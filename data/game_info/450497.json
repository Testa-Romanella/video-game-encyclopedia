You move around and shoot the guys. If you get hit, you die and have to restart. Lol.</p>\n<p>Animations:</p>\n<p>Some simple MS Paint gif animations\u00a0I made when I thought stick fighting animations were cool.</p>\n<p>- Animation1.gif:\u00a0aka When Bond Meets Barbie</p>\n<p>- 1-60.gif:\u00a0aka James Bond Jetpack</p>\n<p>Final Words:</p>\n<p>To be real with you, I\u00a0don't expect anyone to necessarily describe their experience with these games to be \"having fun\"!\u00a0They are an amateur but important part of my history as a game designer and programmer and it's fun to look back on where it all began.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21b8106fa0aa9908fe26308037e2caa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Bradel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
