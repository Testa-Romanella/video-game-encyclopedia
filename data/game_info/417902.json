You can pick up each other and  the things around you to help you jump over obstacles. Be careful with the shredders, they will definitely destroy you.<br/>This game experiments with the concept of trust! If the game seems to be \"buggy\" it is actually a hidden mechanic we added to create distrust between players. Don't worry, we are sure you can work around it :) <br/><br/>\n<strong>*** <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>- This game needs two controllers to be played.<br/>- Read instructions to learn how to throw! Can be really frustrating otherwise.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p>Music by Kevin McLeod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/66096242416f623ddd6b3fb2060d989d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["analauramc2"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
