The changes may affect many parts of the game, are <strong>permanent</strong> and will most likely make\u00a0it more difficult. Almost always you will get some food score.</p>\n<p>Starting from the second round, a question mark on the left side will appear. If you touch it you can get additional food score but\u00a0another <strong>temporary</strong> change event will happen. In some ways question marks can also appear elsewhere on the map. If you touch them you will always get teleported back to the beginning and don't advance a round but they <strong>stack indefinitely</strong>.\u00a0 Be cautious as some of these changes can be\u00a0very risky.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! Don't forget to post some additional events you'd like to see in the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:44:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef7194b419a6c5b1c8f5b152961169ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yonn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
