Victory is decided more by the game than the player. Play a game and watch as you have a clear best decision on every turn only to find that using that action will destroy one of your friends. Come to the moral decision of either keeping to the order of the game all falling for human error and breaking the system. In truth, shed is the worst card game ever made.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&lt; Shed Rules &gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of shed is to remove all cards from your play area starting with cards in your hand, then the <strong>S</strong>faceup cards on the bottom, ending with the unrevealed cards at the bottom.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Turn</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Every turn you will play cards of the same numerical value by dragging them to the middle, (cards of the same value can be placed together by dragging one card over others in your hand) these then become the cards the next player must beat.
