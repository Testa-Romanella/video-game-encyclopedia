In this game, a little smiley face named Smith is being attacked by many projectiles. You can help protect him however with the Smile Shield! It will follow your mouse cursor throughout the level, and any bullets that come towards it will be destroyed. However, each bullet will damage a part of your shield! But, if Smith eats one of the shiny squares that fly around, the Shield will be fully healed! Keep Smith alive for as long as possible! Good Luck! This game was made entirely by me, but with some help from my friends with testing and advice.</p>\n<p>Controls are simple, left click to navigate the menu and the shield will follow the mouse cursor. Press alt+enter for fullscreen (if it does not enable automatically).</p>\n<p>Known Issues/bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>If a bullet spawns facing exactly up or down than the bullet is invisible.\u00a0Barely happens so it should not be too much of an issue</li><li>2 typos in the About page that I\u00a0forgot to fix before the jam ended. The coin on the about page is also placed wrong.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:56:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000d314a7b7ac6c860ace90e86020b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Icosmophedron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
