{"id": 82002, "slug": "patience-deluxe", "name": "Patience DeLuxe", "name_original": "Patience DeLuxe", "description": "Patience DeLuxe is a different kind of solitaire. It is a card game for one, in which you use all the cards. All cards are laid out in 4 rows, after which the aces are removed leaving 4 empty spots. Goal of the game is to fill the spots with cards that follow up on the card left of the empty spot. If an empty spot is next to a two, you can not fill it, since the aces are out of the game. If the empty spot is on the far left of the screen, you can choose any of the four kings to fill that spot. In this way you try to fill all four rows with a different color, starting with a king on the left and ending with a two followed by an empty spot on the far right of the screen.<br/>You get one point for every card that is on the right spot in a row, starting with a king on the left. If all your empty spots are next to twos, the game is over.<br/>Tactics play a huge role in this alternative solitaire game. The order in which you fill up the empty spots has a major influence on the game and can easily be the difference between a clean sweep and an early game over.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/7798b7d4b893605239960c10cd973db6.jpg", "website": "http://coldtomatoes.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mark Vertegaal"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Mark Vertegaal"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
