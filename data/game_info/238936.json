Doctors cannot differentiate between getting lost caused by disease and getting lost caused by natural ageing because a benchmark of \u201cnormal\u201d does not exist. <br/><br/>Until now \u2026 because as you play, your navigational data is tracked anonymously, stored securely and combined with every other player from around the globe, to create the world\u2019s largest crowd sourced data set benchmarking human spatial navigation. This incredible resource will eventually lead to the development of new diagnosis tools and treatments for dementia. <br/><br/>Navigate Arctic Rivers, Golden Shores, Mystic Marshes, Kano Reefs and High Roller storms, collect memories in your journal and chase magical creatures like Adorabella, Galleo and Octopoid. Collect as many starfish as possible and use them to customise your boat with a new lick of paint, a host of flags and much more!<br/><br/>Deutsche Telekom believes that life is for sharing, that\u2019s why they are presenting SEA HERO QUEST \u2013 a game to help scientists fight dementia and work towards a future where memories are shared not lost before their time. <br/><br/>Join the Quest and be a real-life hero.<br/><br/>Sea Hero Quest does not access, store or submit any HealthKit related data. Sea Hero Quest uses ResearchKit to ask optional scientific questions for further helping the research.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e68c2cb78b790ae1c353e0309ffc8f7.jpg", "website": "http://www.glitchers.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GLITCHERS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["GLITCHERS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
