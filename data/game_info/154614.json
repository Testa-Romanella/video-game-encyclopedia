There are a few bugs,<br/> notably a rubbish one with scoring that may or may not manifest depending on<br/>how far you get. Also, I know it can feel like the player toy is running away from<br/>you, but you do get used it (and, anyway, the collisions are deliberately generous<br/>in your favour because I wanted a feeling of panic and luck dodging a landslide).<br/></p><p><strong>TIPS</strong></p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li>Don't move around too much; only move when you absolutely have to.</li><li>Mind you, you can get really close to boulders without getting crushed.</li><li>Don't worry so much about the small brown boulder fragments; they<br/>are only included to add drama.</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a1/5a12d273c447f69ada175f4683d65f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gary Penn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
