Punished by higher powers, the Schlupus is offered a path to it's dark goals: all it needs is to stack two cubes atop each other, and everything will be destroyed. Those that punished the Schlupus thought this impossible, end them.\r\n<p>[ No actual win condition I'm sorry : (\u00a0]</p>\r\n\r\nThe feet and legs are both controlled by IK targets. Additionally, the jiggle on head and nose are controlled by IK targets utilizing simulated ball joints.\r\n\r\n\r\nControls:\r\nWASD to move<strong>Mouse</strong> to look<strong>E</strong> to grab\r\n\n\r\nSpecial Note:\r\n<p>I intend to turn this entire project into a full game at some point. If that sounds remotely interesting, please follow for dev updates when I get the time to do that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccffd0014101cabaef186ef96b6810c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bobo_Baqa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
