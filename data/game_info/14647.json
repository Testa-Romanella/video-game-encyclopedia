May not be suitable for people with epilepsy.<br/>The color puzzle at the end is a side quest and is not required to finish the game. There's also no timer in the game.<br/><br/><strong>Electric Highways</strong> is a game that's all about experience and exploration.The setting takes place in a surreal, virtual world, made out of abstract 3D graphics, where the player must explore ten levels, each with an individual theme. Some levels contain simple puzzles, but for the most part the main focus is exploration. In some ways, the game is like an interactive conceptual music album, where each level is like a short song.<br/><br/>The year is 2072. Virtual reality has become a worldwide phenomenon, allowing people to sink into the virtual web, while experiencing isolation in real life. A VR engineer has finished his virtual reality project, but before uploading it on the web, he decides to visit it for the last time, plunging deeper into his own surreal world.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the game has been inspired by early 80's electronic music (<strong>Gary Numan, Kraftwerk</strong>), visual style of games like <strong>LSD: Dream Emulator</strong> and the 1984 version of the film <strong>Metropolis</strong>. The project uses 3D engine from 90's.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Look<br/>E - Use<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Esc - Menu<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong><br/><br/>Zykov Eddy - Lead Developer ( http://eddyprojects.blogspot.ru )<br/>Xitilon - Composer ( http://r0.kolenka.su )<br/><br/>Special thanks to: Nerdybat, Ivan Azarov, Micky C, Artem Nevinchanyi, Esdeer, James Stanfield (for water texture), Lezing, dv49, all 80's new wave artists<br/>Logo design - dv49<br/><br/>The game is based on EDuke 32 engine ( http://eduke32.com )", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T07:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f62f75550c18f82dd69dcf0722eb25a.jpg", "website": "http://vk.com/eddyindie", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 186, "beaten": 11, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xitilon", "Zykov Eddy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Siberian Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
