You will also need to watch their morale, and with enough unrest your people will abandon you. On top of all this, it's your responsibility to protect your people from constant robot attacks.</p>\n\n<strong>Reclaim the city<br/></strong>\n<p>Vicious automatons plague the land in every direction, but you cannot let them have it. Send your people out to get food and recruit human stragglers. If you have the skill you may even vanquish them and claim a building for your own.</p>\n\r\nAll this has been left to you, General, godspeed and may your wits be sufficient. \r\n\r\n<br/><strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>The city sprites came from Kenney.nl:</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl/assets/isometric-roads-water <br/></p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl/assets/isometric-buildings</p>\n\n<p>The delightful music came from Ketsa:</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ketsa/Different_Angles/Intermittent\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>The fonts came from here:</p>\n\n<p>http://www.publicdomainfiles.com/show_file.php?id=13949893906946</p>\n\n<p>http://www.publicdomainfiles.com/show_file.php?id=13949892922495</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcdce1936cce6d0b7ca7a9b1455ec135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonesnil"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
