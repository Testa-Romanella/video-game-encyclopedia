Don't hate, it's actually fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <strong>Loop Collector</strong> mode, that's your only goal. Collect other loops before time runs out.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Obstacle Course</strong> mode, you must collect loops on your way to a goal. Avoid all the bad objects on your way (you can tell they are bad objects, because they have no-no strips), or you will lose some of the loops you've collected.<br/></p>\n<p>In <strong>Enemy Fighters</strong> mode, you are the boss in a shooter game. The players will come in with their many, many, many, many ships and try to kill you. In addition to avoiding the regular bad objects, don't get hit with a bullet or run into an enemy ship. If they touch your main circle, it's game over, man, game over. Luckily, the loops you have collected will shoot back, although they have considerably worse aim than your opponents (you are a boss, after all).<br/></p>\n<p>In addition to the game modes above, don't forget to check out all 3 themes! Additionally, we offer <strong>colorblind assist mode</strong> to provide better distinction between loops and a <strong>grayscale mode</strong> in case you REALLY don't want color.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Movement: Arrow Keys<br/>Mouse: Menu Selection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a19/a191752074fc84479fd85c228143d085.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A-Flat Miner Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
