This game can hopefully be used for sketching out a place or places and a general atmosphere for another game and can fit within any genere. Maybe you're a sci-fi crew on a mission into unknown space or someone exploring the new forest that sprung up over night.\u00a0Or maybe you're a sleepless and luggae-deprived man who really needs food searching in the rain for a place that serves food. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>This game relies on players asking and answering various questions to define aspects of both their character and the world in general. Discussion is encouraged, as is compromise. Nothing too definite, beyond maybe a few landmarks, will be determined by this game, leaving gaps to be filled in really anyway someone might want.</p>\n<p>Also, this is one of my first games, so any feedback (positive or negative) is very welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca4/ca4ef7a641f0c5caec3abab7475ce3c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retorox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
