He...or she,...They shall bear the mark of fate\u201d.  This game has nothing to do with that...or does it?</p>\n<p>You play as a abused proletariat necromancer, propping up your bourgeoisie mentor through your toil, allowing him to achieve HIS ambitions off the back of your labor.  You do menial tasks with the  promise of someday becoming a powerful necromancer yourself(then things will be different).  Paying your dues and barely scrapping by only to have to resort to eating dirt (sometime literally).  Lately, you have been concerned, perhaps your supervisor...er master doesn\u2019t appreciate all your valiant effort in his service.  Perhaps, he only sees you as a tool to be used &amp; discarded.
