{"id": 743772, "slug": "surreal-experience", "name": "Surreal Experience", "name_original": "Surreal Experience", "description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>Surreal Experience is a game with heavy elements of horror, dark humor, and absurdity. Play as an employee of Surreal Eradicators LLC, a company that specializes in evicting homeless people from abandoned buildings; get your hands dirty and your mind ready to tackle this job with your best foot forward. Almost everyone in this game is your opposition, including your own manager - be smart about your approach, stay alert of your surroundings at all times, and use items you find around the building to ensure your survival.<br/><br/><br/>Surreal Experience requires an incredible amount of skill/inventory management/luck to beat. If you use your items too soon, or aren't fast enough with how you approach the job, you'll lose again and again. Are you up for the challenge?<br/><br/><h3>The Backstory</h3>An abandoned office building lies within the heart of rural America. A structurally sound and well-designed building inhabited by no-one finally to be put to use. That's what you thought anyway when you decided to take on a cleaning gig you saw in the paper. What they failed to tell you is that you won't need a bucket or a mop to clean this place up, though you may want to put some gloves on. The problem here isn't dirt or grime, the problem is people. Homeless people.<br/><br/><br/>Stumbling across the unused space must've been a stroke of luck for these fellas, but it's time for them to go. Navigate the entire office space and do your best to kick them out. Most will go down without a fight, but some of them look a little violent or crazy. Use items to make your job easier, and stay out of trouble.<br/><br/><strong>Will you be able to finish the job and get out with your life?</strong><h3>How to Play/Game Features</h3>Navigate the office building in search for homeless people, and kick them out, but proceed with caution; there is a deranged man running around trying to stop you at every turn. Rumor has it he gets increasingly frustrated the more homeless people you kick out. Some say he's the one who found the old building, and gave these people a place to live. Use items you find around the office to your advantage, like smoking some crack to run faster, or wearing a disguise to blend in and escape his madness.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Be sure to do things quickly and efficiently! Your manager is watching your every step, and if you aren't up to the task, he'll lecture or even fire you!<br/><br/><br/>Watch out for this guy - he exists to do nothing more than waste your time and steal your precious contraband away from you.<br/><h3>Surreal Experience.
