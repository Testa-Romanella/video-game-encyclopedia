The game idea came from a friend who wanted a way to practice spreading butter without ripping the bread. A simple gameplay concept was created and this is the result. This is the first game I have made that has 3D anything. I am really running into a wall in terms of ideas to implement and motivation to finish this. I don't know what a full game about putting butter on toast looks like but then again, before I made this I didn't know what a prototype of a game about putting butter on bread looked like. Drop me suggestions on what you think might make this thing really click. The controls are simple. Click and drag to spread butter. If you drag to fast you will rip the bread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/ceb491f9d70c3b2da991a39a930ba919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RCoriWithTheStory"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
