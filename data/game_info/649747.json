You can't stop or turn\u00a0while charging.<br/>Z will stop HeroSquare in his tracks. Not much to say there.<br/>More detailed instructions are in the zip if you need them.</p>\n<p>/----------\\</p>\n<p>ACTUALLY READABLE CREDITS</p>\n<p>Most of the assets in this project were made from scratch by FatCatFromBeyondSpace.<br/>The fonts were by Kenney over at OpenGameArt - his work is all CC0/public domain, so safe enough.<br/>Sound effects were all made using Chiptone (https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone) - Also CC0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256ffc0f072f3ba5fc3f02891991da91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatCatFromBeyondSpace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
