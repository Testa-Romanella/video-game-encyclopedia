But I got lost in details a bit too much and didn't manage to get everything in there that I wanted, such as:<br/>- sound effects (though it does create a certain atmosphere without them)<br/>- better storytelling / writing<br/>- a second game mode (highscore survival)<br/>- accessibility settings to decrease the difficulty a bit (the game is maybe too hard if you choose a non-violent path, even though that's part of the message)<br/>- and more...</p>\n<p>Not sure yet if I'll have the time for a post-jam version but I'd really love to address these things someday. And to clean up the messy code :D<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5a/b5a310373876265ec75c37c5bd415050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erkberg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
