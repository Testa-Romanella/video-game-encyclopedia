My name is Mohith Krishna. This is the very first 2D video game I made with Unity. Most of the assets were not made by me. I don't think even the idea is very original. But this is the very first step in my journey of game dev. So please download and try out the game. Let me know of any bugs you encounter, I'll try to fix them as soon as I can. I will also try to roll out more features soon enough.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4b219364f84c3763a5d2e57e9225a4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mohith-Krishna-4533"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
