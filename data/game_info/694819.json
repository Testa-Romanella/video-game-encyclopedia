The game includes 2D platforming stages as well as 3D driving stages and it will not hold your hand. Some of the stages requires completing a certain task to progress. Collecting stars and purchasing upgrades with them is essential for surviving. Due to the retro nature of the game, make sure to check out the 'Help' menu before jumping into action.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T05:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/096d5cdea65b0243c8efa6ddc81cface.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Val Ayoto"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
