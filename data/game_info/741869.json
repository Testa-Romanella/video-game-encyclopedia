To quit, you have to get to the top floor of the building, but the elevators are slow, so you have to wait for them. While waiting for the elevators, dodge your coworkers who are trying to give you their work. Made for the TriJam #157.\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator's Note:\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first game.\u00a0Please leave any criticisms you may have in the comments, so that I can improve. Also I didn't have any time to play test\u00a0so please leave any glitches you may find in the comments. I might fix them if I find time. Special thanks to HeartBeast on YouTube for his awesome Godot tutorials.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to use the menus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49d/49d33b0e0a6a7fba856bf4aa528efd4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuantumTieStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
