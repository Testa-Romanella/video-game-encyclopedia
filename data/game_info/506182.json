{"id": 506182, "slug": "fog-of-life", "name": "Fog of Life", "name_original": "Fog of Life", "description": "<p>Fog of Life is a horror adventure experience in which the player has to traverse a very foggy soviet suburban environment to get to their end goal, a village, by using a map and a compass, multiple useful items found in the game\u2019s locations and avoiding or fighting enemies scattered around the place. Orientation is key, if you walk too far off, you might have to pay with your life.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is planned to have co-op game play as well as single player. Co-op sees you playing through the game with a friend. You must take care of each other in order to survive. One player has a map and the other has the compass. Without your friend, you're walking in thick, blind fog - quite literally. Single player is a more independent and lonely experience, yet your character has more abilities.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to OmenaKettu for additional modelling.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T05:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/1491239d42a59e7be374306d5af3347f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SentryTurbo"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
