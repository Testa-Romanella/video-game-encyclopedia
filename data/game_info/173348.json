That is why it's rather ridiculous than scary, I suppose.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What is \"In Tenebris\" about?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, not much so far. You start in a dark labyrinth and have to find 6 keys to open the door to the next room. In order to find those keys, you gotta open drawers, cupboards and press buttons to open certain objects. \u00a0In order to make my game slightly harder I decided to add a ghost that starts chasing you a minute after you've started the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is this game so troll?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess because it is an experiment. I wanted to see how connections between keys and doors, pictures and sounds etc. work.\u00a0\u00a0I'll definitely work on a more serious next level.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Why Justin Bieber?</strong></p>\n<p>Because why not?</p>\n<p><strong>So...</strong></p>\n<p>If you've got any questions concerning the game, feel free to leave a comment down below. I appreciate every single download and all the feedback you can give me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6ff70f4cb461851ef8d745477aa15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tagobott studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
