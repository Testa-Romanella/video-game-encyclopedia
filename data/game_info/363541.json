Try to help the girl remember who she is. This is the first game I made. It was created with RPG Maker VX Ace Lite. The game takes about three hours to play. This game alludes to Creepypasta Characters and Youtubers like Mastermax888, Flying Shark, Luigikid and Riskrim. I hope you have fun while playing the game! In this version I just changed some sprites, a dialog and the music in the first area of the game. Some sprites aren't mine though.\r\nCredit to the people who created them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb7339805b18125ef4ee4c45e4a455b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AbsolLover666"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
