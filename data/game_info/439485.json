{"id": 439485, "slug": "blocky-dungeon-demo-v06", "name": "Blocky Dungeon Demo v.0.6", "name_original": "Blocky Dungeon Demo v.0.6", "description": "<p>Similarly to the previous version, this is a feature-complete demo of Blocky Dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to upload this as its own project because I changed and added enough things to make it different from the old one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The core of the game hasn't changed:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>use Tetris-like mechanics to place rooms and corridors and build an ever-changing dungeon, while at the same time you explore it as the Knight, fighting monsters and collecting loot.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Aside small bug fixes and tweaks all around, the main new features of this version are as follows:</p>\n<p>- a new enemy, the <strong>driller mole</strong>: this monster with a drill for a nose will pierce through walls on its pursuit of the Knight. By doing so, it will also open the way for other enemies, so be careful!</p>\n<p>- a couple of new options to customize how the game is played:</p>\n<ul><li>what I call <strong>Tetris Toggle</strong> (temp) will enable you, when activated, to stop and resume the fall of the Tetris pieces. In the past many people noted how the game can get really hectic and having to keep the Knight and the Tetris board under control at the same time could get very difficult. With the Tetris Toggle function, you can (by pressing the Spacebar or Select on gamepad) stop the Tetris part of the game and focus solely on the Knight, take a look at the dungeon, plan your moves or simply take a breather. This is an option enabled in the main menu, so if you prefer juggling both parts of the game at the same time, feel free to do so! It's all up to how you prefer to play.</li><li><strong>Line warnings\u00a0</strong>are now optional: in the main menu's settings page, you can choose whether to not display any, to only highlight a line when the Knight is on it, or to highlight every potential line.</li><li>Different control schemes: at least when it comes to rotating and hard-dropping Tetris pieces. In the controls page of the main menu, you can choose to invert the controls for these 2 actions. Choose the one you feel more comfortable with!</li></ul>\n<p>- lots of balance tweaks for the \"Classic mode\", with new objectives and new enemy and item distribution across all the floors.</p>\n<p>As you can see, nothing really major compared to the old demo. Still, hopefully these additions will make the game more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Of course<strong> the game is still WIP</strong>. There might be <strong>bugs</strong>, or things that aren't clear. Please feel free to comment and <strong>give feedback</strong>, critique and bug reports.</p>\n<p>I'd like to release the full version of Blocky Dungeon (hopefully with a better name!) in the next few months. I'm still working on making the game more fun, polished and overall better so please stay tuned! If you like the game, don't forget to share it and tell people about it! I appreciate all the support I've received ever since the very first prototype.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f19734fc98bb42ca42b8b180d9b3dffb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
