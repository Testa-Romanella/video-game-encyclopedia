Rather, challenge not only the canonical antagonists, but also completely new opponents. Let everyone know who the most incredible rap star is!<br/><br/>We suggest that you step away from the canon story a little and plunge into one of the most incredible and mysterious parts of the game in which you will meet Big Brother. He is Boyfriend's older brother. Although Boyfriend once defeated him, Daddy Dearest resurrected him. Now he has heart problems and sees ghosts, but this does not stop him from fighting in musical battles!<br/><br/>In this game you will face not only the canonical antagonists of the previous weeks, such as Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Mommy Mirest, Dear Dad, Skid, Pump, Tankman, Senpai, Pico, Spirit. You can compete for the title of rap star with Dahlia, Xeno, Pukes, Azalea.<br/><br/>We've also prepared a lot of new custom mods. You can fight against Big Brother again or try your hand at confrontation with Shaggy, Whitty and Carol and other characters from the mods!<br/><br/>To pass the level, I need to go to all the colored lines that will move down. Click on the arrows and try not to miss a single one, so as not to lose one of the three lives.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T04:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24b8d936a8f4bec0745c21b47b25276d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mikalai Klimovich"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Mikalai Klimovich"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
