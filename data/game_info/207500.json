Based on the Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)\u00a0the particles will live or dead based on its neighbours.</p>\n<p>The user has some tools to change the particles, move the camera, resize the grid or show how the particles change with different colours representing it's life.</p>\n\n<p>The controls are easy. When the simulation is stopped, you can\u00a0</p>\n<p>- change the estate of any particle just clicking on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Resize the Grid with new particles (if you select the random tick the alive/dead ratio will change the grid)</p>\n<p>- Select that you want to show the colour change based on the age of the particle.</p>\n<p>Once you start the simulation you can move the zoom of the camera easily and see how the simulation goes. Also, you can stop it whenever you want.</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback or new utilities, please let me a message!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3d/e3dafd53de660a2a8eee47414fcbc289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dgoldaraz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
