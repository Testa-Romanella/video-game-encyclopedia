Strategize and test new robot combinations to conquer all the coliseum challenges!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the Godot Wild Jam #53! With the theme \"Assembly Required\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beautiful Firefox users:\u00a0</strong>since I used Godot 4 beta, the Shared Array Buffer will not work at the current iteration (01/2023) of the browser. Please download the Desktop version or opt for a fate worse than death (use a chromium based browser).</p>\n\n<p>Tutorial text if you forget any rule while playing:</p>\n<p><strong>Classes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Assemble your Auto Machine before combat by buying components from the store and equipping them! There are 5 classes of components:</p>\n<p>Attack - Determines your base damage.</p>\n<p>Defence - Determines your HP.</p>\n<p>Speed - Determines who attacks first. In a tie the first combatant is chosen randomly.</p>\n<p>Special Attack - Determines the damage of your special attack.</p>\n<p>Core - Determines the cost of temperature points needed for your special attack. Lower values mean earlier casts. After a base attack you receive one temperature point.</p>\n<p><strong>Types:</strong></p>\n<p>Beside classes, Attack, Defence, and Special Attack components also have types. An attack is super effective if the defence type is weak to the attack type. This is the effectiveness chart:</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Upgrading Components:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Upgrading your components is essential to ensure your success in the coliseum. You can upgrade a component by buying a 5th copy while holding the other 4 (3 stored and 1 equipped).</p>\n<p>Upgraded components are much stronger, without them it's impossible to win!</p>\n<p><strong>Buying phase and win condition:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>At the start of the buying phase, you always receive 12 coins. Your money from previous rounds is not carried over to the next one! Try to spend all your money on buying new components.</p>\n<p>You need 7 wins to conquer the coliseum and become the ultimate Auto Machine Assembler! After each fight you will face tougher opponents. If you lose more than 3 times, you are out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a01/a011a08f9506d1253b631b34af07d427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bored_paramecium"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
