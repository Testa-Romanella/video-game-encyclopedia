But what is real, and what is not?<br/><br/>This is my submission for Brackeys GameJam 2022.1, themed: <strong>It is not real.<br/></strong>This is my first time doing a GameJam. also one of the first time trying to make a working game. I am a first year game programmer student so more will come from me. But I had some school things to finish up the first few days of the jam so I started on\u00a0Wednesday and well here I am today.<br/><br/>The game is focused on some new mechanics I wanted to learn and just to make something functional. But as you might see, it is a lot more to do here.<br/><br/>Some things I would love to add:<br/>\u00a0- A better menu<br/>\u00a0- Some settings in the settings menu<br/>\u00a0- Sound<br/>\u00a0- More levels<br/>\u00a0- Change the level Design to low poly models instead of just cubes.<br/>\u00a0- Fix the movement and give the ghost double jump for more interesting levels.<br/>\u00a0- And a lot more.<br/><br/>But thanks for testing the game and I am open for all feedback I can get! This has been fun!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd5a48ae194e9dd254d2b6f99f4fd417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Allkams"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
