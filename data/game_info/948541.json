Led by its powerful, antagonizing CEO Mr. D, this company specializes in Sentries, robots built to house the souls of those who have passed on using Life Chip brain scans of their memories and personalities. The product was meant to change the lives of everyone for the better; however, as the years passed, the product grew in infamy as more people began suffering from the Sentry's defects, and the company began drowning in its poor public reception.</p>\n<p>Living in the backstreets of the city, punk teenager Rosey is on the search for the means to get a Sentry for her deceased girlfriend Lily despite not having the money for it. When Rosey pleads with Mr. D for a chance, a deal is made between the two unlikely allies; if Rosey can investigate a collection of Sentries who have reportedly been experiencing \"technical issues\" and report the cause back to the Hades Corporation, she can have a Sentry for Lily. Thus begins Rosey's adventure roaming throughout Cyber City, meeting new faces and learning the secrets behind new people as she seeks to uncover the truth of what has been causing their problems, and what secrets the Hades Corporation has been hiding under its glamorous PR program.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cheroky Williams - Artist</p>\n<p>Raul Placido - Artist</p>\n<p>Camilo Miranda - Artist</p>\n<p>Russell Goodrich - Narrative</p>\n<p>Michael Scott - Programmer</p>\n<p>Jonathon Mora - Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/163/163483c8ad3e6dbdec5f7be5a30abc62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Life Chip Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
