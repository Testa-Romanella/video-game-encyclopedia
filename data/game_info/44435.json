You are the pilot of an AV-42C, a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capable vehicle that can perform transport, air to surface, and air to air combat roles. Take on a wide array of challenges that will put your flight skills, situational awareness, and combat tactics to the test.<br/><br/>No extra hardware is required.  If you have a VR set with tracked controllers, then you have a virtual cockpit where you can reach out and interact with the stick and throttle, flip switches, press buttons, and even pull the eject handle if things go wrong.<br/><br/>Immerse yourself in action packed combat missions, delicate vertical landings, aircraft carrier operations, aerial refueling and more.<strong>Current Features</strong><ul><li>AV-42C Tilt-jet VTOL/STOL/CTOL Attack/Transport vehicle<br/></li><li>Fully interactable cockpit via tracked controllers<br/></li><li>Various interchangeable equipment - guns, rockets, missiles, bombs, etc.<br/></li><li>Near realistic vehicle systems - heads-up display, targeting pod, multi-function displays, radar, IR flares, chaff, etc.<br/></li><li>Head-mounted cueing system<br/></li><li>Ejector seat<br/></li><li>Realistic vehicle physics - lift, weight, thrust, drag<br/></li><li>Several playable missions - \"story mode\" campaign, free flight, training scenarios/tutorials<br/></li><li>AI wing men - fighter escorts and attack VTOLs<br/></li><li>AI friends and foes - Tanks, artillery, surface-to-air missile launchers, ships, planes<br/></li><li>Aerial refueling<br/></li><li>Ground based refueling and rearmament<br/></li><li>Carrier operations - catapult assisted takeoff, arrested landing<br/></li><li>Island/ocean map</li></ul><strong>Planned Features</strong>To be added throughout Early Access<br/><ul><li>\"F/A-26\" Fighter/Attack Jet<br/></li><li>More weapons and variants for different roles<br/></li><li>More missions/complete campaign<br/></li><li>More maps<br/></li><li>More types of friendly and enemy units<br/></li><li>Better vehicle damage model<br/></li><li>Custom mission/campaign editor<br/></li><li>Randomly generated missions<br/></li><li>Radio communication system for commanding wing men and other AI<br/></li><li>ATC system<br/></li><li>General improvements to existing features</li></ul><strong>\"Stretch Goals\"</strong>If all goes well - possibly in updates after full release<br/><ul><li>Multiplayer<br/></li><li>Full modding support<br/></li><li>More flyable vehicles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-31T07:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e2d42341ad5075accd4f72ca281f11.jpg", "website": "http://www.bdynamicsstudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 125, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boundless Dynamics"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boundless Dynamics"], "esrb_rating": null}
