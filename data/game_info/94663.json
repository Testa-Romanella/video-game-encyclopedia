It's a platforming golf game where you are the ball, and the only way to get into the whole is to hit yourself with a golf club.\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t The theme for this Ludum Dare was 'Combine Two Incompatible Genres'.\u00a0 Due to scheduling conflicts I\u00a0made this one on my own, without the rest of the team .\u00a0 This is why this has more of a 'developer art' feel to it.\u00a0 At the start of the jam I\u00a0had a thought which made me smile, which was\u00a0the idea of trying to play golf if you were the\u00a0golf ball.\u00a0 From this I came up with a plan about\u00a0making a platformer where\u00a0 jumping was only possible by using the golf club.\u00a0 The result is closer to a golf game than a platformer, but I'm pleased with how it plays and I think it fulfilled the theme of the game jam pretty well.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\tAll the actual gameplay is controlled with the mouse.\u00a0 To use the standard platforming movement to the left and right, just hold down the left mouse button and you'll walk towards the cursor.\u00a0 To jump or get over obstacles, you will need to take a shot with teh golf club.\u00a0 To do this just hold down the right mouse button, when you let go you will jump in the direction of the cursor.\u00a0 Click the right mouse button for a small jump, or hold the button down for a\u00a0 morepowerful shot<br/>\n</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is based around the rules of normal golf - get the ball into the hole in as few shots as possible.\u00a0 There is a local high score\u00a0table if you want to try and beat your best rounds.</p>\n<p>Don't forget you can press P to pause and F for fullscreen.</p>\n\n<p> <br/></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay, Art<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f15e77befc1ce2d3ca1318b2ef5f652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
