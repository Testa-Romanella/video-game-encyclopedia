It tells the story of a dispute between robots and humans at the end of the 24th century, in which players as BIOs of mechanical girls survived in the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame play is based on survival and combat. Unlike traditional survival games, players control robots without food and water, they need power and energy; the damage of robots can not be recovered naturally, they need to find materials to repair, but also can make more detailed modifications.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe background of the game is in the period of war between man and robot. As the protagonist of robots and human and robotic forces are in a hostile state, players need to survive in a war zone full of hostile forces, or become friends with one force, relying on other forces to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers can find all kinds of weapons and equipment available in the ruins. Weapons themselves have durability settings, each repair will gradually reduce the durability limit, which requires a reasonable arrangement of the use of weapons and material consumption, through a variety of tactical ways to solve the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game contains certain random elements. Every time a player starts a new game, the map changes: for example, the location of the NPC and the safe house changes randomly, and enemies in some areas also differ.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/877d1c3964dd55e62d66b92dce53ed19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fire Engrave"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Fire Engrave"], "esrb_rating": null}
