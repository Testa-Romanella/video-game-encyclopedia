I was just about to join my mother at the poolside of our condo when I remembered: the Extra Credits Game Jam had started! I quickly looked up the theme before heading out: Take Care. I would eventually decide such an intimate theme calls for an honest-to-life expression of people caring for each other, and it just so happened that our conversation as we lounged by the poolside that afternoon fit the bill perfectly.</p>\n<p>Poolside is an interactive, to-scale drawing of a summer afternoon on a single sheet of paper (please avail yourself of the fullscreen button in the lower-right corner for the best experience). You play as a yellow square that represents me. Use WASD, arrow keys, or the left analog stick of a controller to move me, and use space, shift, ctrl, or any controller button to jump, dive, and surface. A shoddy attempt at closed captioning is included, which you can turn on and off with the click of a button in the upper-left corner of the page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a4533cd15848397e7dcce69c9127d7e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CalebBennetts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
