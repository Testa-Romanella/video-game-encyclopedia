That is, not only did I end up with a game that you can play, but it is actually quite entertaining.</p><p>I've tuned the difficulty so that it will provide minutes (MINUTES!) of replay value. You may be screaming at your screen \"BUT THERE ARE NO MICE IN THIS GAME\" however, if you play with your sound on you will be able to hear them as they explode inside the bricks.</p><p>Please enjoy my game. I learned enough from the beginning to the end of the development process that by the end the code I wrote at the beginning confused and disgusted me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a26e3767688cee3684b59ba057ad2b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scotttromley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
