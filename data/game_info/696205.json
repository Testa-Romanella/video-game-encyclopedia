Throughout the game, Cera is taught real life therapy tools to help her handle her anxiety and cultivate meaningful friendships. Players gain insight to what therapy actually feels like, breaking the stigma surrounding it. \r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Choose the Healthy Choice, not the Friendly Choice</strong><br/>Many visual novels reward over-friendly options and pushing yourself onto characters. In Call Me Cera, the Player is rewarded by matching the vibes of the NPCs instead of forcing friendship. It demonstrates how to build trust and foster healthy relationships in real life. \r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diversity</strong> <br/>Call Me Cera takes place in a fictional Northeast coastal town in the United States called Fernweh (pronounced Fern - Vee), with a strong LGBTQIA+ and diverse community. Toadhouse Games has reached out to the communities we aim to represent to ensure we do so in an accurate and respectful manner. We also hire cultural consultants and sensitivity readers.\r\n</p>\n<p>Does Cera make friends and live her dream life?\u00a0<strong>You decide.</strong></p>\n<p><em>A portion of all\u00a0Toadhouse Games sales goes to charities that benefit the marginalized groups our characters represent.\u00a0\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Call Me Cera:\u00a0A wholesome game about making friends as an adult.\u00a0\r\n</strong>Wishlist here:\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1523870/Call_Me_Cera/\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Come chat to us in our Toadhouse Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Q5mK58hMSt\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Play the CMC vignettes here:\u00a0https://teamtoadhouse.itch.io/\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Follow Toadhouse Games:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Toadhouse_Games\r\n<br/>Follow Call Me Cera:\u00a0https://twitter.com/CallMeCera\r\n<br/>Follow Team Toadhouse:\u00a0https://twitter.com/TeamToadhouse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/888aa5bc0bf8b29ef38599c6e3497022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Toadhouse Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
