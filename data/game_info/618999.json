Demons, Angels, and Fluids abound, as do apartments, parties, strife, and sunglasses stores. Doors -\u00a0with a capital D -\u00a0allow one to warp to new areas. Regular doors still act like regular doors.</p><p>Statsless, system-neutral, ready for a fever dream or near death experience or ongoing jaunt in reality's attic.</p>\n<p>This dungeon exists because of Amen\u00a0Break. That RPG posits dungeon rooms connected by doors that act more like portals, and the PCs crawl through these 'Twisters', trying to destroy them and arrive at the seat of the Demiurge, POINT SAINT NEMO. Amen Break is awesome and has a lot of random tables for making Twisters and PCs and NPCs.</p>\n<p>More rooms are coming. Unless life and that uncaring God have other ideas.</p>\n<p>How to Fold a Pocketmod - the rooms are a pocketmod and include a screen-friendly pdf as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art is collages I\u00a0made from\u00a0public domain images\u00a0from oldbookillustrations.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fddb71f3964b12d2508b5225fe4e5a2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["charvus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
