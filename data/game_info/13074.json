You compete locally with three to eight players at the same time on the same screen. <br/><br/><br/>A unique landscape is generated for each race. During the countdown you make a plan, taking into account the terrain, your opponents and the power pickups.<br/><br/>With a special power, or just a simple nudge, you can send an opponent off track, sometimes with fatal consequences. But when the others are closing in, be sure you can pull it off without harming your own position.<br/><br/><strong>Use a gamepad or your phone</strong>If you don't have enough gamepads, download the experimental controller for your Android or iOS device. Find the app by searching your app store of choice for 'Chalo Chalo WiFi controller'. Download the app and connect to the same WiFi network as the computer running Chalo Chalo.
