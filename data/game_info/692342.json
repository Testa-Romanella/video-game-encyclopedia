We recommend downloading one of the native versions below for the best experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Frantically maneuver your way around a constantly morphing map in order to survive for as long as possible! Different color tiles will apply different effects/\"curses\" to your character, with differing effects:</p>\n<p> \u00a0 blank tiles don't do anything<br/>\u00a0 red tiles kill you immediately<br/>\u00a0 orange tiles give you a shorter jump<br/>\u00a0 yellow tiles slow you down<br/>\u00a0 blue tiles give you slower acceleration<br/>\u00a0 pink tiles break your dash ability<br/>\u00a0 green tiles clear your current status<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>A - move left<br/>D - move right<br/>K - jump<br/>L - dash</p>\n<p>We also have 3 characters to choose from, the same in all ways except for their jump:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Bitboy - Very strange jump that literally decreases gravity. We don't know how he does it. (Hardest to control)<br/>\u00a0 Jankman - We love him. Has a janky jump that becomes smoother the longer you hold the jump button. Previously known to clip into ceilings (we don't think so anymore).<br/> \u00a0Constance - A constant velocity jump for sane people. (Easiest to control)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Notable techniques:<br/>Jump Preservation - You don't need to be on the ground to jump! If you walk off a ledge, then you can jump from mid-air<br/><br/>Wall Jump - If one jump doesn't quite do the trick, then how about two? Dash at a wall to regain your jump<br/></p>\n<p>Credits<br/>idk what to put here, if anything lol<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T10:30:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba6eb3980cadcd9ca6e6f7ce59a2254.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aekai", "hdelc"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
