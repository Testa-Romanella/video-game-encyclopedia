{"id": 427500, "slug": "crisp-cube", "name": "Crisp Cube", "name_original": "Crisp Cube", "description": "Crisp Cube is an action puzzle game where you melt away diverse sets of cubes to clear each level and enter different worlds. You play as Mr. Crisp. Mr. Crisp starts at one end of a grid-like play area while a sequence of diverse cubes appears on the other side and begins to roll towards him. Help Mr. Crisp melt away all but the black Void Cubes, using standard or special triggers, to clear each level. If you accidentally melt away the wrong cubes or let non-void cubes roll off the edge, the play area will shrink; this could lead to Mr. Crisp\u2019s untimely demise. Make no mistakes, however, and Mr. Crisp will gain more play area to stand on. Crisp Cube is inspired by a game called Intelligent Qube.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T05:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d3/9d3abbb41eef3fd985d6b5a96756f46d.jpg", "website": "http://www.crispcube.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crisp Cube Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crisp Cube Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
