Resource-laden exo-planets in nearby systems are mined until their physical structures collapse. Newly discovered life is often exterminated to conform with a doctrine of \"potential competition eradication\". Alien life that has biological characteristics considered to provide financial or military benefit is \"acquired\" - suffering a fate far worse than eradication. <br/><br/>Despite a persistent saturation of pervasive propaganda, a small uprising deep within the walls of Earth's mega-cities has risen to oppose the relentless destruction and crushing oppression of the corporations. Specializing in cyber-warfare, the uprising has found an opportunity for retaliation in the form of access to the drone control networks of the iron-fisted military divisions of the ruling corporations. This development represents a rare chance to inflict wide-reaching disruption of highly profitable off-world operations. <br/><br/>As a veteran cyber-mercenary you have been assigned to prevent the destruction of what remains of Planet Zerous. At this time, the expeditionary forces of Universal Industries have nearly come to the end of another eradication routine and all but secured the unknown resource that drew them there in the first place. Your mission is to deplete combat forces on Zerous and secure the resource. This will be achieved by conducting a remote cyber-warfare operation.<br/><br/>Probing has revealed a breach in the satellite network (SATNET) on Zerous enabling the remote operation of an RT6 maintenance unit. Scans also show an assault mech located in the area of operation. Harnessing the potential firepower of the battle-tested R65 'Big-cat' will be essential to complete this operation successfully. The combination of drones with careful strategy and resourceful tactics may be just enough to force the invaders of Zerous to evacuate the planet and send a stern warning to the hostile brotherhood of ruling CEOs.<strong>ROADMAP</strong><br/><ul><li>Release Early Access mid-2017 (this release)<br/></li><li>Implement multi-player (deathmatch and coop) as part of Early Access <br/></li><li>Complete single-player campaign <br/></li><li>Release full version Beta early-2018 <br/></li><li>Balance multiplayer/refine singleplayer based on community feedback and extensive dev testing (ongoing)<br/></li><li>Final retail release 2018 </li></ul><br/><strong>Stay tuned for development updates, weapons tests, gameplay videos and screenshots!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89a3677171db84ffae33306dca9c8bcc.jpg", "website": "https://www.dronertw.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infamus Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Infamus Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
