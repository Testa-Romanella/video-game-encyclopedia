If both vehicles are near each other the player may swap between them in order to get a better perspective on the global fires. Caution: you might get stuck on the probe for one or two orbits \u2026 \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>As this game is a prototype for testing out various mechanics there are a lot of bugs, too. It might happen, depending on your hardware, that the probe gets out of range for good after a few orbits \u2013 you may have to restart at this point \u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The prototype is resource hungry! Somewhat decent machines (~3Ghz)\u00a0will handle fine, I guess. The better your CPU the better overall performance (Orbiter bug less likely).\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you have any ideas, thoughts, critics, please let me know!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>allroggen.b@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T03:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d0e37bfaed6d41bf16904f852b9514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlurEd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
