Our team has come this far and prepared an interactive game, all the assets and designs included, to show how these wonderful organisms adapt to the struggles that space provides. The game has been designed with a specific purpose in mind. Even though our team wants to make sure the final product will be fun and entertaining for the users, the main goal was to create a thought-invoking experience. We have designed it in such a way that it showcases the potential of these organisms in future space studies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T13:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/026a643b4c169846fbffa576fbf3fc85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IHasBrain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
