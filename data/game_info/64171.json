They must be separated from their present friends. We must find friends and say goodbye. Of course,we can also take pictures for memorial.Game background:<br/>The \"WW Fantasy\" selled now is my personal development of the magic war commemorative edition, that is, look at the scenery, to commemorate the players who are waiting for it.<br/>\"WW Fantasy\"this game was developed in 2014 by individuals, and began testing in 2016, when the test perfected 26 roles and opened more than 100 levels to support matching and beating.The first test was in January and February 2016. The second test was May 2016. The third test was in August, and had five or six thousand people played in one year.But at that time, art resources were not well enough to go online, so we began to look for art. Later,we were short of funds and had to stop developing. We also want to restore the development, but can not solve the problem of personnel funds and financial matter.Because the pressure of work in the game industry is huge, and the development of this project is even more intense. So some of the team members choose to give up the project. And we are not able to achieve full time development,the game has been developed without money.So it will drag all the time and eventually lead to a stagnation of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33fc137b2a3ea65a7298a77e7514bcc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lcc"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lcc"], "esrb_rating": null}
