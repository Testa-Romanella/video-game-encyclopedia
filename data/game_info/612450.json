The theme of this jam was \"Glitched!\". It's the first time I've experimented with the \"RPG Paper Maker\" Engine. I will use it in further projects and will enhance / polish this game after the jam.</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>For this project I've got support from different people, who give me good assets and usefull advises:</p>\n<ul><li>I use parts from \"Wood's Fine RPG Paper Maker Assets\" (in original and customized format). Thank you \"Wood\"</li><li>The main background song comes from the relatively new founded band, which my brother is a member of. I like to thank the \"Cube Vibez\": Patrick und Michaela Wei\u00df, Christoph G\u00e4rth\u00f6ffner, Jonas Feth and Christoph Schmitt.</li><li>I'm pleased for the interchange with the \"Paper Jam 2\"-Community. Here special thanks to Wano, cid331, HACKY and the rest of the jamers.</li><li>And at last, I want to thank my kids for the good ideas and my wife for the advises. So I consider the result / the game as a common \"family Project\".</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T07:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd28047e9cb029afd218afa10957258d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["torte00"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
