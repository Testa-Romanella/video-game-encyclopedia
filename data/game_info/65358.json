Play as Larry, a lazy binge watcher who ends up in a dimension that\u2019s based upon his favorite Landflix (a video-on-demand parody) TV shows. Make him travel through many shows, gathering powers based on their lore, while helping famous characters and ultimately face an evil genius trying to conquer the world. Help him gather blueprints for his scientist relative, Uncle Doc, to power up said skills.<br/><br/><ul><li>5 worlds based on famous tv shows.<br/></li><li>Use 5 powers based on said shows plus Larry\u2019s signature move, his huge burp.<br/></li><li>Power up your skills to increase your chance of saving the world.<br/></li><li>Defeat or avoid The CEO\u2019s minions and other evil creatures trying to get the best of you.<br/></li><li>Fight 5 bosses and 5 minibosses based on your favourite antagonists.</li></ul><br/>As you binge watch like usual, you unexpectedly discover the existence of a parallel fictional dimension inside Landflix through the use of nuclear batteries and a normal remote controller. As you set foot in Landflix\u2019s home you meet Uncle Doc, a scientific genius who had recently disappeared. Before you can understand what\u2019s going on, a small robot appears. He has a small screen on his body that displays an old man\u2019s face. He\u2019s Landflix\u2019s evil CEO, who sent his minion after you to steal the nuclear batteries in an attempt to escape Landflix and conquer the world with his army of fictional characters. As you fight over possession of the remote, 5 of the 6 batteries fly out of the remote and end up in different TV shows, and the robot retreats. Finally you have time to try and understand what\u2019s happening. Apparently the CEO was once your uncle\u2019s coworker, but as his evil intentions started to become clear, your uncle sealed him in a parallel dimension. The CEO used this dimension to create Landflix, a system designed to decrease the cerebral capacity of the masses with its TV shows, and easily conquer the world. When Uncle Doc noticed something was up, he entered Landflix to try to stop the CEO himself, but mistakenly ended up becoming trapped. Now your only option (and the only way out) is to stop the evil CEO and get back all 6 batteries!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e894ed56886434a2ee4ae8346d6a443.jpg", "website": "http://www.landflixodyssey.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fantastico Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fantastico Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
