It is a very short game comprising of &lt;10 minutes of\u00a0gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is our first time that we take part in a game jam.<strong>\u00a0BlackThornProd (BTP) Game Jam #1</strong>\u00a0gave such a beautiful theme that we couldn't resist but to try and make a\u00a0<em>somewhat\u00a0</em>emotional game. The theme was<strong>\u00a0\"Game Dev\"</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the game received good feedback, we may continue developing it since the project is very interesting to us. Of course, due to time limits, we have to limit ourselves as well.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any issue/bug, please do comment below.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun fact:\u00a0</strong>Didn't realize the origin of the game's\u00a0name? The '<em>Develo</em>-' is from development and '-<em>Mare</em>' is from nightmare.
