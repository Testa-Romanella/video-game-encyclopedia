I hope you like it as well. The game is about 5-7\u00a0minutes long. I've only been able to test the Windows version of the game but I have included Mac and Linux versions as well. If there is any issues with them please let me know and I'll try to fix it if I can.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:53:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cde3b50c276575285e8837cf57b8d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shahryar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
