Dodgeball elevated to a new, chaotic level. Dodger and her twin brother Rodger are a competitive duo, always trying to one-up each other. Dodger tried it first. Then Rodger joined a small local group. Then Dodger joined a larger, more regional competition and won. Then Rodger joined the national championship, Dodger following close behind.<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Now, they face off at the final round. Who will win...?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Dodge Arena is a Top-down, local multiplayer arena game inspired by Dodgeball. Play in one-on-one matches against your friends and try to score enough points to win, or be the last one standing!</p>\n\n<p>Score points by hitting your opponent or by catching the ball. Just be warned:\u00a0Get hit too many times, and the game ends by Knockout, and it takes fewer hits to be knocked out than points to win! Once things really get going, winning by Scoring becomes increasingly difficult!</p>\n<p>There are also 5 different ways to play, with increasing difficulty for each game mode!</p>\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In Practice mode, Bumpers are all set to Basic, with no special effects. Good for introducing new people to the game before adding in the real challenge and complexity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Standard:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In Standard mode, Bumpers will always appear in the exact same order.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Random:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In Random mode, the Bumpers will be arranged at random at the start of the game. There will be a different layout, different types of bumpers, and different amounts of each, every time you play!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chaos:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In Chaos mode, Bumpers are randomized at the start, and will also change types every time they're hit! The Bumper\u00a0cooldown time has been greatly reduced, as well!</p>\n<p><strong>Pandemonium:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In Pandemonium mode, cooldown time has been turned off entirely, and the entire Bumper layout is changed every time a Bumper is hit! Yes, this is as chaotic to look at as it sounds, and NOT recommended if you have epilepsy! That's not us trying to sell features to Hardcore Gamers tm, it's a legitimate warning. Please be safe while playing our video game!</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Fast-paced PVP gameplay</li><li>An isometric, cartoonish aesthetic</li><li>Wall Bumpers with special effects to make each game unique</li><li>5 Game Modes which effect how Bumpers are placed in the game</li><li>Two characters with unique dodge styles.
