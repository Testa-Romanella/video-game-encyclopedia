It features 2-bit colors with interchangeable palettes, over 100 levels, and a very brave little battery. I always enjoyed older platformer games when I was young, so I wanted to try and make my own! My planned release platforms are Steam, Xbox, Microsoft Store, and soon after launch, Nintendo Switch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T04:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66d6b6a9c84a54220b1f8c28104e7107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HurtTree"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
