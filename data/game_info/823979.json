{"id": 823979, "slug": "bridgebreaker", "name": "BridgeBreaker", "name_original": "BridgeBreaker", "description": "<p>BridgeBreaker<strong>\u00a0</strong>is a\u00a0game in which you control a mech to break bridges and score points! It is a small, turn based procedural strategy game made in TIC-80 during two weeks for MechJam3.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game is best played using a keyboard. The <strong>A</strong><strong>rrow Keys\u00a0</strong>controls the mech, while\u00a0<strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> selects in\u00a0menus. The <strong>A</strong>-button\u00a0opens a menu in-game. <strong>ESC\u00a0</strong>takes you to the default TIC-80 menu where some settings are available.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to step on and\u00a0break as many tiles as possible while still making it to the end of the bridge without falling off. The mech will jump one- or two-tile gaps, but only if there is enough fuel left. Grab green pickups to refuel.\u00a0At the end of every bridge there's a row of golden tiles that takes you to the next level. The levels get\u00a0progressively harder as the game goes on. When you eventually fall to your doom, you're presented with your final score for that run.\u00a0</p>\r\nSpecial thanks to...\r\n<p>... the organizers of MechJam3, it's been a fun one!\u00a0\u00a0I dedicate this game to my 2 year old who taught me much about smashing things with construction equipment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T11:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c845be145f3997d9673bb37613fee9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PoodlePilot"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
