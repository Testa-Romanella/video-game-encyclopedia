Navigate the halls of the laboratory where you are being held, find out the truth about the experiments, and find your missing sibling before you get out. The game focuses heavily on story as well as exploration and will have you fleeing from dangers both real and imagined, although just as baneful.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/8_knot</p>\n<p>Email:\u00a0knot8.studios@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T08:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131ed63a977fa316bba71c0523e5f86a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Knot8 Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
