{"id": 682315, "slug": "revillagigedo-islands", "name": "Revillagigedo Islands),", "name_original": "Revillagigedo Islands),", "description": "<p>This is 'Revillagigedo Islands),', a new video game from Outhouse Media.<br/>\nThe game, which is set among the Caribbean, features a predominately male cast and offers a story about a detective. During a proposal meeting, an absent husband interrupts the scene and works alone to bring a woman with a proclivity to commit infidelity. The woman, who is romantically linked to her husband, takes advantage of his weakness to get and initiate sexual contact.\n\nNarrated by James Mercer, the film follows the detective as he tries to solve a series of cases. He encounters one case that has no explanation but could be related to the theme of the game.\n\n\"It's a fairly dramatic premise, but one that we wanted to live up to,\" said Mercer. \"It's a game that's to give players the chance to relive that innocent, human feeling, which is what Outhouse makes so interesting.\"\n\nThe game is a companion piece to Outhouse's subscription paid RPG, Crisis of Stars, which is also set in Caribbean waters.\n\nGame creator and President of Outhouse Media Alex MacDougall admitted that the idea for the game came from watching the game Four Pinocchios.\n\n\"I was intrigued by the juxtaposition of the narrative and the gameplay,\" he said. \"I wanted to replicate that sense of mystery, and the idea of a hero with various shades of grey. It was a chance to learn more about the Caribbean. The game is a Venice club game as it's called</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/2252455cc73fcf3bc578d09884f97409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
