It was developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis in 1991.</p>\n<p>Ork is a platform game with five levels. It takes place on an alien planet called Cisskei, where the player character, an alien called Ku-Kabul, must find his way through each level in turn. The levels are filled with puzzles to solve and enemies to kill.</p>\n<p>Ku-Kabul is equipped with a machine gun and a jetpack. However, these must be used with care, because ammunition and fuel come in a finite supply, although replenishments can be found in some places.</p>\n<p>Ork is noted for its theme music, composed by Tim Bartlett.</p>\n<p>Keeping with Psygnosis's tradition of including references to earlier games, the third level of Ork includes one bit where lemmings generate out of thin air, walk a few dozen metres, then jump off a cliff.</p>\n<p>The cover artwork for Ork is the image Behemoth's World, which was painted by Richard Clifton-Dey, and was also earlier used as the cover for Blue \u00d6yster Cult's 1980 album Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0df591e1284fd7d5fdefeb86ea76609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["WJS Design"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "esrb_rating": null}
