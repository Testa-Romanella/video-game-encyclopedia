{"id": 158793, "slug": "subwaykiller_milestone-3", "name": "SubwayKiller_Milestone #3", "name_original": "SubwayKiller_Milestone #3", "description": "<p><strong>Subway Killer</strong>\u00a0is a 2D action game created by Zaiyun Lin. In the game, players control a frantic assassin whose mission is to wipe out certain targets in the subway station. \u00a0 Players have to exterminate their targets by pushing them into the track and smashed by the train. Also, players have to avoid the revenge of furious targets who just climb back to the platform and the patrolling policeman. Try to kill as many as possible, and survive as long as possible!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Kill\u00a0<strong>RED\u00a0</strong>guys. Those are your targets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kill them with train's\u00a0head will grant extra score. Kill them by kicking them multiple times will grant extra score.</p>\n<p>Civilian(BLUE guys) killed by train\u00a0will make you\u00a0lose the game.\u00a0<strong>But\u00a0</strong>you \u00a0kick them\u00a0off the railroad and\u00a0if they come back, you will grant extra score for adding chaos in the subway station.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Control:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: WASD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kick: W/A/S/D + Space bar</p>\n<p>The inspiration of such art style is from the animated science fiction series \u201cRick and Morty.\u201d I really like series itself as well as the art style of them. And I think such art style is perfect for a 2D game, so I tried to implement it to my game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had to retake this course and do it all again, what would you have done differently the second time?</strong></p>\n<p>I would write the code of basic control in another way to make this game \"feels\" good. Also I would like to change the core gameplay of this game, make it more intuitive, more creative and more interesting. Because now I am lot more experienced than before, I think the game will be better in many ways than now, and take lesser time to produce.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you expand this game or continue working on this game in the future? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I think I will not expand this game. Because I want to start a new project from the scratch. Also I want to start making 3D games. It will be lot more interesting. So just let it rest in my computer.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>In terms of process, has making this particular game changed how you approach making games in general?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, this is the first time I made a complete\u00a0\u00a0digital game. Every aspects of this game\u00a0have to be made by myself. Go through this\u00a0process, have make realized that making a game is much harder and time consuming than I imagined. But also is a\u00a0extremely interesting and rewarding process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51a/51a1642676f1a95d408f27d6a87ddae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["linzaiyun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
