{"id": 52409, "slug": "combat-1977", "name": "Combat (1977)", "name_original": "Combat (1977)", "description": "<p>Combat is an early video game by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600. It was released as one of the nine launch titles for the system in September 1977, and was included in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. Combat was based on two earlier black-and-white coin-operated arcade games produced by Atari: Tank (published under the Kee Games name) in 1974 and Jet Fighter in 1975.</p>\n<p>Earlier in 1977, Coleco had released the similarly titled Telstar Combat!, an entry in its Telstar series of dedicated consoles. Unlike the Coleco game, Combat had color graphics and numerous gameplay variations. The 27 game modes featured a variety of different combat scenarios, including tanks, biplanes, and jet fighters. The tank games had interesting options such as bouncing munitions (\"Tank-Pong\") and invisibility. The biplane and jet games also allowed for variation, such as multiple planes per player and an inventive game with a squadron of planes versus one giant bomber. Atari also produced a version of Combat for Sears titled Tank Plus (alluding to the original arcade game Tank). Combat was programmed by Joe Decuir and Larry Wagner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1977-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-28T11:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/5380d6c5396ecd7c4de3ef3b311d78a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 16, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["Atari Flashback", "Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Atari"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
