It's about a ghost who wants to maintain her youth and beauty, but the only way to do it is she has to become a blood-sucking, baby-eater monster.\u00a0 You can say that it's the Asian version of a vampire.</p>\n<p>It is a relatively easy detective game that you can solve in minutes. I\u00a0wanted the game to embody the cheesy 90s movie posters I used to have a love-hate relationship with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da87a40bb11205bb133413bafbc9ea22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChiliHour"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
