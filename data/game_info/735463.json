(Link)\r\n<p>The theme was Birds.</p>\n<p>The limitation was: \"Cannot stop moving\". In my case I\u00a0decided to keep the player moving all the time. i hope my interpretation works.</p>\n\r\nCarry the Pigeon\r\n<p>Is a 2D pixel art game, made using godot and playable only on the web browser. The main objective of the game is deliver as much letters in the building as you can. Avoid death, boxes and guns is also a good path.</p>\n\n<p>Aseprite: was used to design the whole art of the game. By me, \"one man team\"...for now.</p>\n<p>Godot Engine: It is the game engine I prefer using as it is very versatile and practical.</p>\r\nMy overall experience on my first Game mini Jam:\r\n<p>Well I really enjoyed making this game without more pressure than \"have fun and do things as polish as possible\". The 3 days time frame I\u00a0can see why it was choose, as if you are a one solo man project, like me, you can take 1 day per area:</p>\n<p>- 1 day designing the main concept + mechanic's.</p>\n<p>- 1 day coding + testing that mechanic to see how fun it is or what may get turned.</p>\n<p>- 1 day on art + putting all together.</p>\n\n<p>I know that's the order I have used I guess yours can be different. That's all right. Well finger crossed and I\u00a0will leave bellow some credits for music and sound effects.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Dead loop music.\n<ul><li>https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/282568/sad-guitar-2-free-140bpm-hip-hop-a...</li></ul></li><li>Play music.\n<ul><li>https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/282561/lionel-messi-spanish-guitar-by-jul...</li></ul></li><li>Victory music.\n<ul><li>https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/145109/victory-guitar-120bpm-funk-electri...</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Sound Effects from: SoundBible.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f336e4d6260ce430f68a56f045b2c2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saturno Mangieri"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
