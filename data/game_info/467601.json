Fortunately, you're one of the good guys. Instead of using your skills for evil, you're using all the tools at your disposal to take down the evil HedgeFund Corporation.</p>\n<p>Make your way through HedgeFund's headquarters using your hacking skills to take over the minds of the guards who stand in your way. But think carefully. CTRL is a limited resource, and if you don't use it wisely, you may run out and find yourself backed into a dangerous corner. (You'll run \"Out of Ctrl\", get it??????)</p>\n<p>Also, you're\u00a0a raccoon.</p>\n\n<p>BUGS:</p>\n<p>- Sometimes when scanning, you can select spaces where there aren't any enemies, but doing this can cause a crash. Just focus on the enemies you can see</p>\n<p>- It's possible to cheese one of the guards on level 5 (but you'll miss out on one of my favorite statuses)</p>\n<p>- Sometimes restarting the level doesn't work if the ui is in a weird state (try hitting shift if this happens)</p>\n<p>- The tops of ladders can be a little sticky. Just wiggle around a bit and you'll get through</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4016cb97dd10d94eaedbca7af09775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phineus"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
