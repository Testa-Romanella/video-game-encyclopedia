This version is just the beta mechanics on how the combat should work so you can expect much more features that will be added to the game such as story line,\u00a0 new enemies, new maps, dialouge,etc</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this version is only 3% of what the main game should look like</p>\n\n<p>How to play: In this game you play as someone that has the power to push/pull certain object and she can use that power to inflict the damage to her enemies by pushing\u00a0 those objects to them. Keep attention to the crosshair cause when it turns pink, it means that the objects in front of her can be interacted. Also, enemies'attack and traps (currently a yellow box) can destroy interactable objects and once all of them is destroyed , she will have no way of beating her enemies.</p><p>Also, there is currently no objectives and it is just a sandbox-ish game to test out the combat</p>\n<p>Download Instruction:</p>\n<p>Download as zip in the mega folder and extract it.</p>\n<p>Control:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Left-Click to push</p>\n<p>E to pull\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/565275be33b3fb4db35e059575151316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["superherolol123"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
