To visualize the environment and the enemies, the player is assited with an echolocation system to determine the direction and distance of objects and threads surrounding it.<br/></p>\n<p>The Game was\u00a0developed\u00a0by Rubix Interactive, 6 students\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Games\u00a0Academy\u00a0Berlin and one external sound designer, <br/>within 41 days.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Echolocation: </strong>Emit your echo scream to make your surroundings visable for a brief moment, so you can find the safest way through the attic.<br/></li><li><strong>Dangerous cats:</strong> Cats are lurking all around the attic and will catch and eat you if you are not smarter than them.<br/></li><li><strong>Hidden Objects: </strong>Open your eyes!
