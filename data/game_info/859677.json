The theme of the jam was 'every 10 seconds'. <br/></p>\n<p>Description:<br/></p>\n<p>Are you ready?\u00a0 This is what you\u2019ve been trained for. The effluvia is thick, from our analysis, you should have around 10 seconds before you feel the effects driving you into thirst. Kill all the bloodzerks, or as many as you can to reach evac in one piece. Whatever you do, dont let yourself go past the edge of lust, you dont want to end up a \u2018zerk. Good luck.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Sprint\r\n</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>Q - Spike/Melee Attack\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Use Injector\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Fire Gun\r\n</p>\n<p>Developer Notes:\r\n</p>\n<p>This  is my first ever game jam, enjoyed myself despite the stress of coding  under the clock.  Almost got the scope of the game just right, I think I bit off a little  more than I could chew though, I was only able to get one level finished  before the deadline. I was in the process of building another but I got a devastating crash  and lost an hour of work an hour before the deadline which is why the  cdode for multiple levels is there and bits of design with the intent of  there being more.  Excited to do my next game jam :D.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f2cd658ec5ddd919909d25a85f2a89c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dollcoded"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
