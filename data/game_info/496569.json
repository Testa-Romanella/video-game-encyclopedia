(Since it's swimming, maybe it should be called \"endless swimmer\" instead??)\u00a0 It is different than other \"endless\" type games, because the player can move the fish up or down beyond the bounds of the screen.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is still in early alpha, and LOTS of improvements and changes are still being currently being worked on.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chua Productions\u00a0(ChuaProductions.com) is my 1-person indie videogame studio,\u00a0and skills-for-hire service (programming, UX/UI, Art,\u00a0sound design, QA, game design).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was inspired because of my love of nature and snorkeling and scuba diving, and I want to share my love of the sea with everyone! ^-^ Aside from that, this game is very dear to my heart because I would like to raise awareness about the issues that marine life is facing. I grew up in the Philippines, which is surrounded by the sea. So when issues face the sea and the marine life, it has more impact to the people in the Philippines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942b61acaabb6bae315c8dbeec70a0fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BerniceChua"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
