It contains a lot of secret content. It may or may not contain dozens of references to hip-hop songs that will fly right over your head. It may or may not contain a secret robot boss with the face of William Howard Taft. It absolutely does contain funk, flavor, and good old fashioned, honest-to-goodness, thank-you-for-not-wasting-my-time FUN.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>http://wherecouldtom.be</p><p>http://twitter.com/TomSennett</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e4dc2e9383efc1995c069668425255b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tom Sennett"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
