Like Riddle School, use arrows and objects to escape.</p>\n<p>BEHIND THE SCREEN:</p>\n<p>I always wanted to make a game, it was one thing on my list of things to do and when I first heard flash was coming to its end-of-life, I thought it meant it wouldn't be updated, but now I know the real meaning, I got really upset.</p>\n<p>My plan was to make a flash game and upload it to newgrounds, but exporting was a problem. So I decided to keep it HTML and upload it to itch.io instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T04:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/62472d738c5b41ab45a1f7fe2f10e540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RedHeartStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
