This was mainly developed to test out a new game mechanic. At this point of time it is unsure, if I'll update the game at any point of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Use WSAD to walk around and your mouse to schoot. The projectiles of the gun will create a lightsource on inpact. Use these lightsources to reveal the path. Note that you can only have 2 lightsources at the same time (left and right click).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have Fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2797455fe963a9c8b7b0f40fb02053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Theras"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
