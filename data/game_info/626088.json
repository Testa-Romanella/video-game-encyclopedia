Though if you'd rather avoid getting chased down by the demons, building the raft out of trash is the way to go.</p>\n<p>You can chop down trees for wood, and every once in a while, a piece of trash washes up on the island for you to collect.</p>\n<p>The crafting menu can be accessed with TAB.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5545ec062e72eda0a35471b67bac18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T\u00f3rbj\u00f8rn Rygaard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
