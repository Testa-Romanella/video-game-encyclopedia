I think it's a pretty neat little feature :)</p><p>Basic instructions:</p><p>Type the word shown once the game starts. You lose if you let the ball past you, but if you don't finish a word the ball won't necessarily get past you. (this is intended). You get more points for finishing the word quicker, but it also speeds up the ball. In addition, getting the ball past the opponent grants you an extra 1000 points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d82ed3940c64b4e4022a184cede27f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bearchinski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
