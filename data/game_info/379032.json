That is, unless you\u2019re a lowly line cook like Irene Turnsole. After Irene travels to her late father\u2019s home, she discovers that her sister has gone missing and nobody is coming to help find her. Turnsole suspects the cultists of The Light of the Future, her own father\u2019s extreme futurist corporation, but proving it isn\u2019t going to be so easy. Irene soon discovers she has just two days to track her sister down before the cultists perform an ominous-sounding ritual. To solve the mystery, Irene must dig into the secrets of her father\u2019s corporation, a world on the edge of the Singularity, and her family's own painful past \u2013 before precious time runs out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T04:37:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/015317091cbd095189918f99d5d1a5c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WhiteLocke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
