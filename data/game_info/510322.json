The game's premise is to identify the AI fish that are different before running out of time.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to pan around the scene looking carefully (but quickly) at each fish. For the fish you observe that are different (i.e. Changing their colors), hit the <strong>&lt;SPACE&gt;</strong> key. Use the mouse to hover over them to highlight. Hit <strong>&lt;SPACE&gt;</strong> again to remove the highlighted fish\u00a0and keep going.\u00a0 Don't linger too long as the timer keeps going while you're trying to decide which fish to highlight!</p>\n<p>Hit <strong>&lt;P&gt;</strong> to <strong>Pause/Unpause</strong> the game while playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To <strong>EXIT </strong>the game, you can hold the <strong>&lt;ESC&gt;</strong> key for a few seconds</p>\n<p>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49b620259f949794262e26d8f77c4050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rodellison"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
