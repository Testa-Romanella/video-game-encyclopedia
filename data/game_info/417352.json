This was also my second time delving into Unity, so a LOT of research was put into figuring out simple things such as:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-how do I animate sprites? how would I teach my team members to create the frames necessary to do so?<br/>-how do I transition between scenes?<br/>-how do I play videos and animations outside of\u00a0 characters?<br/>-how do I write in C++?<br/>-how do I detect collision?\u00a0<br/>-how do I release the game as a program, or online, or for mobile?<br/>-how do I lead a team of artists when they don't know how Unity works?</p>\n<p>This game was made within a span of a weekend, and will be further expanded upon for my Game Design Lab Final Project. Many firsts were accomplished for this game as well.</p><p>Team:</p><p>Leader/Coder/Animator/UI Artist: Me!
