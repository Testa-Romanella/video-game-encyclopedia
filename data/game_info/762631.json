This tool is unfinished graphically, but we wanted to get this out to the community and decided to release our fully functional Alpha 1 for testing and feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>*The tool is and will always be free as long as I\u00a0am in charge of the project.*</em></p>\n\n<p>The<strong> LoR Draft Tool</strong> allows for players to draft in two playable modes: Single Draft, and Custom Draft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>Single Draft</strong> features selection of each expansion to pick from. The draft has a deck tracking tool, and cards list, and will provide you with 3 random regions (x2), followed by 3 random card choices you can make to create your deck. Once you are finished drafting your deck, you will be able to copy the working deck code into Legends of Runeterra, to challenge yourself while climbing, challenge your friends, or even play drafted tournaments using your own rules for expansions. Don't like Bandle City? Throw it out the window and pick from the other regions.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>Custom Draft</strong> allows the user to enter their own card pool to choose from. If you're a new player, or you want to challenge your friends by drafting from the same pools as you, it allows you to copy LoR deck codes and enter them into the Draft tool client. You can create decks in Runeterra up to 100 cards and save them.\u00a0Even though these decks are obviously unplayable, you can copy their deck codes and enter them into the client. The client will then use the 100 cards you've selected as your draft pool. This step is repeatable as many times and with as many cards as you want.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you wanted to create a custom draft with a group of people, you can keep your 100 card deck code(s) &lt;- as many as you want, and tell your friends or group to only use those deck codes in their custom draft, then proceed to play against each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you\u00a0make this?<em> </em></strong><em>I always loved the random draft opportunity in card games, and wanted to produce the same feeling for LoR, which is a game I absolutely love.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your plans for the future? </strong><em>We're going to make the application load faster, we're going to make it pretty, &amp; we're in the process of creating an online\u00a0\"Box Draft\" game mode, where you can invite friends to draft from the same (custom/random) group of cards, until you all build your decks to compete against each other.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Please remember to read the README file in the ZIP! You will need to have the correct Java Runtime Environment installed to use the application, so we advise loading the application from the ZIP so you don't have to install Java yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For any bug reports or suggestions, please feel free to contact myself or Noggy. And if you enjoy chatting LoR in an active community, or want to reach out to me on discord, join the discord in the <strong>Credits </strong>page.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for trying out our application. Enjoy and please feel free to use the app however you want, tournaments, solo play, or against your mom/buddy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T17:01:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grim", "Evan.Wood999"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
