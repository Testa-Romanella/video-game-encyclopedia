We are very much open to ideas and criticism so please feel free to give either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The initial idea generated by Orteils\u00a0was 'An experimental game where you gravitate around the laws of physics with a magic wand'.</p>\n<p>The current thought is to make a puzzle game using magic spells that create different physics based spells, the current spells are a 'Push' and 'Pull' that are able to affect rigid bodied cubes referred to as physics props or boxes, each box has a weight attached to it. There is also a pressure plate that has a weight needed to activate so you have to move the boxes onto it until the weight\u00a0is equal to or over the needed value, this will then activate a portal that will take you to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:47:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a697a95f8ada43ddbb29d38b5cacd11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Green Lion Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
