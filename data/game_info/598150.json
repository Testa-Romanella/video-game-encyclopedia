Thanks for checking out my game! It's not much of a game yet, really, more of a tech demo for the building generation and lighting that I'll be building the defense mode around. Eventually, you'll be defending your fully destructible city in turn based battles using giant robots (think XCOM meets EVA), but that'll take a damn long time to get implemented, so enjoy this fancy diorama generator in the mean time. Next release should be a demo with\u00a0actual gameplay, so keep an eye out!\u00a0\u00a0 - Stevie<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Left Click:</strong> Place mouse cursor tile</p>\n<p><strong>Tab</strong>: Swap mouse cursor between tile and building preview (press twice to generate a new building)</p>\n<p><strong>Right Click</strong>: Place building</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Wheel</strong>: Change manual tile placement choice (Also incl.
