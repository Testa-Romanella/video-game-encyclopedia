(I have made a few while following tutorials/books before)</p><p>As of today (Jan 13th 2016) it isn't very fun yet in my opinion, but you might enjoy taking a look at it.</p><p>I wrote it for the January 2016 lisp game jam in about 10 days. As a result of this, the current game code is quite messy and the design could use tweaks but the game does work (at least on my machine!).</p><p>You can find the git repo here: https://gitlab.com/azrazalea/crypts-and-corpses.</p><p>I will be updating it soon with cleaned up code and tests, eventually new features. If you want to see what it looked like at the end of the game jam checkout the game-jam-release tag.</p><p>The game in its current state as of the end of the jam:</p><p>You are an angry necromancer (purple angry face). You run around a hard-to-see-in[i'll fix that in a future update, I swear!] dungeon with the goal of killing those lousy happy people that live there (blue smiling face). You accomplish this with the help of your loyal minions, raised from the tombs with your necromantic powers (yellow angry face). You use your powerful ranged magic and less powerful melee attacks to accomplish this. You must kill them all or die trying.</p><p>See my post mortem here: http://azrazalea.net/posts/A-ramble-about-a-game-idea.html</p><p>Cover image taken from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emblem-deadly.svg under the  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/18055b8259f4f185c316c5b080525ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["azrazalea"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
