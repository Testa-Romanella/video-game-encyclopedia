Made in ~11 hours for SIP Jam 2019.</p>\n<p>Controls are Space to jump with WASD to aim the jump. To jump diagonally, use multiple directional keys - such as W + A to jump up-left.</p>\n<p>The levels are randomly generated, but you will have the same one each time, to allow you to get better at the level with practice. To get a new level, just start the game over.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>This sky image - by\u00a0Mohammed Tawsif Salam, used under a CC-BY-SA license.</li><li>The bird sprite - by Mantis, used under a CC0 license.</li><li>This glass tap sound effect - by zembacraftworks, used under a CC0 license.</li><li>Code, music, and all other assets in the game were done by me (Ashley).</li></ul>\n<p>Source code available here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/476efd6d2b8a4ffe6ed88582ee6f51a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dialupnoises"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
