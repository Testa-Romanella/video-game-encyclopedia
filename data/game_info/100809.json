We had to design the game on paper only, but I decided to have a go at creating something playable. This game wouldn't have been completed without the support of magicdweedoo.</p>\n<p>I've uploaded the game design documents I submitted during my years at university. Whilst I can clearly see that I didn't actually achieve much of what I\u00a0set out to do in them, I figured somebody might be interested in seeing them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f49f6feba7de728497ead6c42c55b4e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SilbinaryWolf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
