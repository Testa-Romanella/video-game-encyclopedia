Out of sheer\u00a0boredom, the kids have devised a little game: get from one\u00a0side of the town's bridge to the other in as little time as\u00a0possible. You are Martin McFlannigan, the only kid to not\u00a0yet win a round of this competition. After taking cues from\u00a0a certain 80s Time-Traveling Sci-Fi movie, however, you\u00a0decide to make your next attempt a little more daring...</p>\n<p>NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY ACTIONS DEPICTED IN-GAME AT HOME\u00a0(i.e. SKATEBOARDING IN AND AROUND TRAFFIC).
