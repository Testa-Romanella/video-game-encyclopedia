When he finds out that he doesn't have \"any\" food left, there is only one thing he can do. Break everything to call for his owner! Break jars, furniture, vases! Turn televisions on. Make as much noise as you can. So start breaking! To play the game you only have to move and jump. Try jumping over everything in your background including pictures.<br/></p><p>Originally submitted to the GGJ 2017.<br/></p>Credits:\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Pedro Moniz\u00a0(programming)</li><li>Ricardo Rodrigues\u00a0(programming, level design)</li><li>Rita Ribeiro\u00a0(art)</li><li>Sara Martins\u00a0(programming, UI design/art)</li><li>Vasco Rodrigues (programming) </li><li>Thanks to GTavares for making the sounds!\r\n \r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T03:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9da7f225e061e6031a58b9b98ca6dd8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Quenestil"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
