To do so you must unload boats, but, be careful, some of them could be infected!<h3>What happened?</h3>After the First World War, Eastern Europe has fallen into chaos... Bugs are eating all the crops, spreading diseases, and bandits are everywhere... There is no government to bring peace to the region which means cities must survive by themselves...<h3>Inspect boats!</h3>When a boat arrives in your port, you must inspect it before unloading or refusing it. You must verify the report by looking at the boat and comparing it to the report. If you correctly verify the report you will get some rewards. But if you don't pay attention enough attention to the infection, you will have problems with bugs that will eat some of your resources!<h3>Manage your port!</h3>You start with a very basic port, but this port will not be enough to survive in this post-WWI world. You must quickly develop your infrastructure if you want to last(the city to survive). Construct new buildings, upgrade the ones you already have, or research new technologies! You can also hire employees to increase your building\u2019s efficiency, but they will ask for a daily income. And don't forget to send some resources to the city, otherwise your citizens will die!<h3>The world will not be kind!</h3>You will need to be ready for all sorts of events that could happen in your port! One bad shipment could spell your doom!
