It is called <strong>One</strong>. And it is an interactive music player, with controls over moods, effects and other fancy ways to play my custom semi procedural composition. This first opus celebrates the beginning of a series of innovative and unprecedented musical experiences.<br/></p>\n<p>Playhear is a project I'm working on for which the focus is on interactive music. I'm actually developing a game called Square Paper City in this series.<br/></p>\n<p>And because I need some support over the process, I thought that it would be cool to invent a new way to compose, play and share my music. This is what the <strong>Playhear Players</strong> are about: make bi monthly\u00a0custom interactive music players.</p>\n<p>Now, and if you liked this, head to my Patreon in order to support the creation of all these unique interactive music stuff!</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cb47a85bd5d00d3dae355aad91769c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tomavatars"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
