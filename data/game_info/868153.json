Below the castle is the Well of Monsters. At any moment the Well could overflow, putting an end to his power. <br/>Who will he send to clear the well? <br/>Who would do anything for a piece of gold?<br/><br/>Play as the Gilded Knight, a former soldier who is plagued with greed. Destroy monsters by luring them into the King's crushing hand or by using one of the many game-changing power-ups.<br/>But most importantly, collect the GOLD!<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>Gilded Eternal is an action, arcade, score-chasing game. It's a 2D, pixel-art platformer, focusing on single rooms. It's fast and fun, and you will die a lot. The game is about luring monsters. There are different types of monsters, all with unique attacks and ways of moving. Players will have to learn the monsters' intricacies to perfect their luring technique.<br/><br/><strong>The idea that started this was, 'What if the goal was also the obstacle.'. In this game you have to lead the monsters while also avoiding them. Get them where you need them to be while jumping over and ducking under them.</strong><br/><br/>When monsters are destroyed they drop coins. The coins are your main \"points\" but can also be used to purchase power-ups to change up the game and make each run unique. Power-ups like jetpacks, revenge-seeking sawblades, and shrink rays. Coins can also be used to purchase many new (and some returning) characters.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Lure monsters</strong> to their doom by learning their movements and attacks<br/></li><li>Run, jump, and wall-jump with <strong>polished platforming mechanics</strong><br/></li><li>Destroy monsters in quick succession to <strong>rack up combos</strong> and get more coins<br/></li><li><strong>Beat your high score</strong> in this infinite score-chase game<br/></li><li>Use <strong>game-changing power-ups</strong> to make every run unique<br/></li><li>Enjoy beautiful, animated <strong>pixel art</strong><br/></li><li>Jam to several tracks of synth-y electronic <strong>music</strong><br/></li><li>Express yourself with unlockable <strong>characters</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T05:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7efd54bb5c78c7ecea69156171bf80b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scott Ethington"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scott Ethington"], "esrb_rating": null}
