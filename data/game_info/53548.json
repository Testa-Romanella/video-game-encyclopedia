It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the sequel to Sonic Advance 2. The game stars the characters Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, and Cream as they seek to keep Doctor Eggman and his robot assistant Gemerl from building empires on each of seven chunks Eggman has divided the Earth into.</p>\n<p>The game is a fast-paced 2D platformer that takes place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a boss fight. It allows one or two players to control any two of the five characters; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more divided on the team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan in May 2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T18:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/470f76c3b43e1a4fa3252e14af9f058a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 20, "beaten": 47, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 13, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 41, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 62, "reviews_count": 41, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "developers": ["Sonic Team", "DIMPS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
