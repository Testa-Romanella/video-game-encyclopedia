Just sit down, grab your mouse, swing it around, crash into <strong>gems </strong>and collect point!</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong> is all you will need, so you can use your other hand to eat some chips;)<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is to get as high score as possible. You do that by crashing into the colorful <strong>GEMS</strong><strong> </strong>with your gray square. By collecting you also build up your <strong>multiplayer</strong>. Higher multiplayer = higher score. <br/>You have only 60 seconds so hurry up. If you have any multiplayer left after the times run out you can keep playing if you keep the multiplayer up!</p>\n<p>Be careful, there is a purple triangle that doesn't like you. You will have to dodge it when it charges on you. If you get hit you will get stunned and also loose a gem that could appear.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>\n<br/>Used Resources:\r\n<ul><li>Music:\u00a0Patrick de Arteaga</li><li>Background: wallpapercave.com</li><li>Shatter Sound: Wine Glass Shattering A1 Sound Effect</li><li>Hit Sound: Floor Tom Drum Hit Level 7B Sound Effect</li><li>Leader board: Silen Wolf</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:29:39", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rhubaruth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
