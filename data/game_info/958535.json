I'm doing everything independently- with some help from friends! (Music, Character Designs, Sprites, BGs, Writing, Coding, and advertising!)\r\n</p>\n<p>My pronouns are She/Her, I am 24, and my favorite color is pink!\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to make this otome game because I adore beautiful and well fleshed out games, and I wanted to make the development process completely public because I went into this with no experience making games whatsoever. But thanks to my best friend Willow and my husband having education in game design and coding, I was given the strength to make this dream a reality. It makes me really emotional to see people enjoy my work because doing art and creating loveable characters is one of my biggest passions!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Project Cassiopeia to me is the entire world. The community I have been able to create because of it, the experiences I have had and will continue to have are things that I will hold very close to my chest always. This game is a love letter to everything I love about otome games and visual novel games, and of romance.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I cannot express enough how much making this game means to me, and I always strive to make sure everyone who supports me feels seen and noticed. I am blessed with a talented community of wonderful and creative individuals, and if nothing else, I want to inspire everyone to follow their dreams and be who they want to be; no holds barred.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>my main socials are:\r\n</p>\n<p>twitter: https://www.twitter.com/moonjorasmask\r\n</p>\n<p>instagram: https://www.instagram.com/moonjorasmask\r\n</p>\n<p>tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTd77rxxm/\r\n</p>\n<p>and the official Project Cassiopeia socials are:\r\n</p>\n<p>twitter: https://www.twitter.com/procassiopeia\r\n</p>\n<p>instagram: https://www.instagram.com/procassiopeia\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for being here!\r\n</p>\n<p>Without these special people in my life, this would not be possible.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>My husband, SquishyOctopus (for supporting me no matter what)\r\n</p>\n<p>SullenWillow (for being a coding genius)\r\n</p>\n<p>Cataberry (for keeping my head on straight during the long script writing days)\r\n</p>\n<p>LexyRex (for helping me with my very few typos and giving real time reactions)\r\n</p>\n<p>And all of my wonderful discord community members!
