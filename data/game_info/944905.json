Battle deadly (or not) foes, encounter valiant (or weird)\u00a0allies, and watch the growing mentorship flourish (or flounder) between the two leads.\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/><br/><br/>Baum is an old-school type hero who is now quite old. Lark is the fresh and up-and-coming hero who is setting out on her first adventure. Join these heroes as they adventure to stop the rising threat to the kingdom, The Clockwork Count. Expect lots of whimsical scenarios, challenging encounters, and, of course, loads of arguments and disagreements.</p>\n<p>Combat in Baum &amp; Lark is a lightweight, turn-based RPG system. Use strategy to select the best stance which supplies the available actions. Then utilize the charms to activate actions to defeat your foes. But watch out!\u00a0The enemies also have actions and charms to fight back with!</p>\n<p>We made this teaser to gauge interest in turning this into a full game experience. The demo is a single scenario with a couple normal fights and a closing boss fight. Don't expect too much!\u00a0If you try it out, please help us evaluate if we want to continue with this project by filling out the feedback form below.</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T14:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d17a16a3d9135c637a8871143e4744f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rue Rogue"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
