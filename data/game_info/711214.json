Structures are frozen together with both background and foreground ice blocks. If a structure of ice blocks is not connected to the ground, it will fall.</p>\n<p>With the lighter, you have the ability to loosen ice blocks (foreground or background) that are suspended to make them fall.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Most Important Information:<br/>\n</p>\n<p>- <em>Foreground ice blocks </em>can be <strong>loosened/thawed </strong>when either <em>air</em> or <em>background ice blocks </em>are directly below.<br/>- <em>Background ice blocks </em>can only be <strong>loosened/thawed </strong>if <em>air </em>is below them<br/>- Structures are only able to stand when they are <strong>connected </strong>to something. When they are <strong>floating </strong>in the air, they will <strong>fall</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Controls (Keyboard):</p>\n<p>[Z] to MELT, [X] to CANCEL<br/></p>\n<p>[LEFT/RIGHT] to MOVE</p>\n<p>[Z] to SHOP, [X] to CLOSE</p>\n<p>[A/S] to look UP/DOWN<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game technically has controller support, but the controls aren't labelled in-game.
