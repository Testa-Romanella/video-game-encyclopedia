Taking heavy inspiration from Touhou, TSTM has 4 playable characters and eight stages. Every stage consists of a bullet pattern and an enemy to defeat. You only have ten seconds to defeat them, but you can add more time to the clock by \"grazing\" bullets (getting close to them without touching them.)</p>\n<p>See how high you can score!\u00a0You can even save replays of your performance!</p>\n<p>More than eight stages were planned, but I stopped at eight to keep the scope under control. I have other ideas for the game though, and may implement them in the future.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow keys - move, navigate menu<br/>Shift - Focus (Hold this to move slower and make more precise movements)<br/>Z - Fire, confirm<br/>X - cancel<br/>Esc - exit stage</p><p>Title theme by M-A-L-L-O-W</p><p>Stage theme by Moonwind:\u00a0http://moonwind.pw/index.htm</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec5c9b34fbdbb0d78dcb4431ed1eae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ephraim225"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
