Because only when you get through this time of action and lack of time, you can really enjoy Christmas.</p>\n<p><strong>We hope you like this little Christmas Game and wish you a merry Christmas!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MVP - GG EZ</strong></p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>In this game you can...</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Run (left and right)<br/>\u00a0- Jump<br/>\u00a0- Attack (But not so hard!
